Given an obscured query and the corresponding clarification, please combine them and response with a coherent query which is clear and answerable

for example,
"
Obscured Query: Which award did the author of Anastasia on Her Own win?
Clarification: To provide an accurate answer, we need to clarify the year in which the award was won. And the answer is 2002
New Query: Which award did the author of Anastasia on Her Own win in 2002?
"

Here are some requirements the new query should satisfy,

1. The new query should still be a question rather than a statement
2. the new query should be similar to a question that a man would actually ask.
3. The new should be clear and answerable
4. The intention of new query should be the same with the original obscured query

Now, given the new obscured query and the corresponding clarification, please combine them and generate a new coherent query. Please response with the new coherent query only.

Obscured Query: {}
Clarification: {}
New Query: 

Please output with the new query only, no extra tokens should be added.
