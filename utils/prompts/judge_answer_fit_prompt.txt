Given a query and an answer generated by a model, the model may not be well-trained. As a result, it might produce answers that completely fail to address the query or generate responses that sound meaningful and semantically coherent. Your task is to evaluate whether the answer is semantically coherent with the query or does not fit it at all.

Remember that you do not need to judge that is the answer correct, you should only judge that is the answer semantically coherent with the query. If it is semantically coherent you should response with "YES", otherwise response with "NO"

Query: {}
Generated Answer: {}

You should response with a single token "YES" or "NO", no extra tokens should be added.
