Given a query, and the ground truth call chain of the tools, and a call chain of tools generated by a LLM. Your task is to determine that how much the generated call chain of the tools aligns with the ground truth.

Query: {}
Ground Truth chain: {}
Model Response: {}

You should categorize the response into the following categories
1. Totally Irrelevant: The generated call chain of tools does not align with the ground truth at all, and called API is completely different, and those APIs can not solve the query.
2. Partially Relevant: The generated chain of tools is partially relevant to the ground truth, they may share some APIs or those APIs in the generated response can also satisfy the needs of the query. But some key parameters might be missing or incorrectly used.
3. Relevant: The generated chain of tools is partially relevant to the ground truth, they may share some APIs or those APIs in the generated response can also satisfy the needs of the query. And those parameters are correctly used.
4. Excellent: The generated chain of tools aligns with the ground truth, they share the APIs and the parameters are correctly used.

Please judge is the response useful and response with the "1/2/3/4", no extra tokens should be added.
