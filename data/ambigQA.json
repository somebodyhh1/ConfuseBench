      "# Shot heard round the world\n\n\"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase that refers to the opening shot\nof the Battle of Concord in 1775, which began the American Revolutionary War\nand led to the creation of the United States of America. The phrase has\nsubsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.\n\n## Skirmish at the North Bridge\n\nThe phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord\nHymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the\nOld North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers\nfell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically,\nno single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots\nwere fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans\nwere killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that\nevent are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the\nfirst shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by\nAmericans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat.

In\n1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as\n\"Lexington Day\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday\nis Patriots' Day.

      "# Shot heard round the world (soccer)\n\nThe \"Shot heard round the world\" is a term used in reference to one of the\nmost historic goals in U.S. soccer history, which allowed the U.S. national\nteam to make it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup after 36 years of failed attempts\nto qualify. This goal was scored in the qualification game between United\nStates and Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989 in Port of Spain. The U.S.\nteam had not qualified for a FIFA World Cup since 1950, and the U.S. (having\nbeing selected by FIFA in 1988 to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup) wanted to give\na good impression to the world of soccer by qualifying to the 1990 World Cup.\n\n## Background\n\nThe United States was one of the five nations competing in the final round of\nCONCACAF's qualifiers for two spots at the upcoming World Cup in Italy, the\nother involved nations being Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Trinidad &\nTobago. Mexico was disqualified due to a scandal related with the age\nadulteration for a youth tournament, known as los cachirules. In that time,\nthe U.S. team was formed mainly by college and semi-professional players. They\nstarted by losing 1\u20130 to Costa Rica, then they got revenge by beating Costa\nRica 1\u20130, tied 1\u20131 against Trinidad and Tobago, won 2\u20131 against Guatemala and\nwon 1\u20130 against El Salvador. After scoreless draws against both Guatemala and\nEl Salvador, the situation of the group was as follows: The United States\nneeded a win in order to qualify for the World Cup because a loss or a draw\nwould allow Trinidad and Tobago to qualify. Costa Rica had already\nmathematically qualified for the tournament in Italy.\n\n## Match\n\nThe game was played on November 19, 1989 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium in\nPort of Spain. The stadium was painted red, as an homage to the Strike Squad\nas the Trinidad and Tobago team was then known as. In the first minutes, John\nHarkes tried unsuccessfully to score. Trinidad and Tobago's Elliot Allen had\ntwo attempts on goal. At the 30th minute, Bruce Murray passed the ball to Paul\nCaligiuri, who dodged a rival defender and with a left-footed shot scored 1\u20130\nfor the United States. Trinidadian goalkeeper Michael Maurice waited for the\nball practically standing on the goal-line, but he couldn't see it, arguing\nthat the sun had blinded him. In the second half, the Trinidadian team went\ninto attack in order to get a draw, but their efforts were in vain, as\nAmerican goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to stop Trinidad and Tobago's\nattempts. After the final whistle, the U.S. celebrated the victory while\nTrinidad and Tobago was left in consternation.\n\n### Details\n\n## Post-match\n\nAfter game, the group results were as follows: Due to the political situation\nin El Salvador and the fact that El Salvador and Guatemala had no chances to\nqualify for the World Cup, the matches still to be played between El Salvador\nand Guatemala were cancelled. The U.S. press, considering the significance of\nthe result, described Caligiuri's goal as \"the shot heard 'round the world\".\nAfter 36 years of absences from the World Cup, the U.S. team qualified for the\n1990 World Cup but its participation in the tournament was brief. They lost\n1\u20135 to Czechoslovakia, 0\u20131 against hosts Italy, and 1\u20132 against Austria. The\nU.S. would consecutively qualify for the next six subsequent World Cups, and\ncouldn't keep the streak going until 2018, because they lost 2\u20131 to Trinidad\nand Tobago during their final qualification game. Trinidad and Tobago suffered\na protracted crisis of confidence until their own World Cup dream finally came\ntrue in 2005, after beating Bahrain 2\u20131 on aggregate in an intercontinental\nplay-off, which allowed the Soca Warriors to qualify to the 2006 FIFA World\nCup in Germany. Yorke and Latapy (survivors of the qualifying campaign of\n1989) were part of that Trinidadian team, which in that World Cup drew against\nSweden 0\u20130 and lost against England 2\u20130 and Paraguay 2\u20130, being eliminated in\nthe first round.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20131 United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Concord Hymn\n\n\"Concord Hymn\" (original title was \"Hymn: Sung at the Completion of the\nConcord Monument, April 19, 1836\") is a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson written\nfor the 1837 dedication of the Obelisk, a monument in Concord, Massachusetts,\ncommemorating the Battle of Concord, the second in a series of battles and\nskirmishes on April 19, 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution.\n\n## History\n\nIn October 1834, Emerson went to live with his step-grandfather Ezra Ripley in\nConcord, at what was later named The Old Manse-- less than a hundred paces\nfrom the spot where the battle took place. In 1835, he purchased a home on the\nCambridge and Concord Turnpike and quickly became one of Concord's leading\ncitizens. That same year he was asked to give a public lecture commemorating\nthe town's 200th anniversary. The \"Concord Hymn\" was written at the request of\nthe Battle Monument Committee. At Concord's Independence Day celebration on\nJuly 4, 1837, it was first read, then sung as a hymn by a local choir using\nthe then-familiar tune \"Old Hundredth\". The poem elevates the battle above a\nsimple event, setting Concord as the spiritual center of the American nation,\nremoves specific details about the battle itself, and exalts a general spirit\nof revolution and freedom-- a spirit Emerson hoped would outlive those who\nfought in the battle. One source of the hymn's power may be Emerson's personal\nties to the subject: his grandfather William Emerson, Sr., witnessed the\nbattle at the North Bridge while living at the Old Manse. Emerson's poem was\nwidely published in newspaper accounts of the dedication; in contrast there is\nno record of Congressman Samuel Hoar's speech that day. The poem, originally\nprinted as a broadside for distribution at the monument's dedication, was\nrepublished as the last poem in Emerson's first edition of Poems in December\n1848 (the book, however, was dated 1847). In that edition the poem appeared\nwith the three line title \"HYMN: / SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD\nMONUMENT, / April 19, 1836.\" Emerson apparently confused the date of the 1837\ndedication a decade earlier, July 4, Independence Day with the anniversary of\nthe battle, April 19, Patriots' Day and the inscription on the obelisk\nmentions that it was erected in 1836. Emerson's line \"the shot heard round the\nworld\" is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution, and the opening\nstanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French The Minute Man statue\ndedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875\ncommemoration of the original battle. \"Concord Hymn\" established Emerson as a\npoet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist. Emerson biographer\nRobert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he\never wrote. Concord's centennial celebration of Emerson's birth in 1903 ended\nwith a singing of the hymn.\n\n## Text\n\nBy the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April\u2019s breeze\nunfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard\nround the world. The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror\nsilent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which\nseaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set today a votive\nstone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are\ngone. Spirit, that made those heroes dare, To die, and leave their children\nfree, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Shot Heard Round the World\" at Minute Man National Historical Park\n  * Choir from Concord sings Concord Hymn.

      "# Chess World Cup 2019\n\nThe Chess World Cup 2019 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament\nthat took place in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, from 9 September to 4 October\n2019. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. Radjabov and the\nrunner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the\nWorld Chess Championship 2020. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nLevon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the\nquarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave on tiebreaks.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Teimour Radjabov in the semi-finals.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Yu Yangyi, to claim 3rd place. This tournament\nalso saw Jeffery Xiong (31st seed) progress far, being knocked out in the\nquarter finals to the ultimate champion/winner Teimour Radjabov.\n\n## Bidding process\n\nThere was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad\nevents, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation.\n\n## Format\n\nThe tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round\n6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40\nmoves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30\nseconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of\nfour classical games. If the score is tied after the classical games, rapid\nand, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are\nplayed with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment.\nIn the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10\nminutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two\nblitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied\n4\u20134 after all these games, a single \"Armageddon\" game is played: the player\nwho wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per\ngame and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting\nfrom move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black\nadvances if they win or the game is drawn. The two top finishers qualified for\nthe 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be\nthe top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because\nCarlsen as World Champion does not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had\nalready qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the\nWorld Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the\nprevious edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana\nboth declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply\nthe two finalists.\n\n## Schedule\n\nEach of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular\ntime limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final\nround has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for\ntiebreaks, if required.\n\n  * Round 1: 10 September \u2013 12 September\n  * Round 2: 13 September \u2013 15 September\n  * Round 3: 16 September \u2013 18 September\n  * Rest day: 19 September\n  * Round 4: 20 September \u2013 22 September\n  * Round 5: 23 September \u2013 25 September\n  * Round 6: 26 September \u2013 28 September\n  * Rest day: 29 September\n  * Final and play-off for third place: 30 September \u2013 4 October\n\n## Prize money\n\nThe total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000.\n\n## Participants\n\nThe participants were seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2019.

      "# Fred Rutherford\n\nFrederick \"Fred\" Rutherford is a fictional character in the television sitcom\nLeave It to Beaver. The show aired October 4, 1957 to June 20, 1963. Fred is\nportrayed by Richard Deacon. Alan Rachins played the character in the 1997\nfilm adaptation of the series, Leave It to Beaver.\n\n## Overview\n\nFred is the head of the \"Rancho Rutherford\" household and is married to\nGeraldine/Gwendolyn. He is the father of a son named Clarence, played by Frank\nBank, and nicknamed \"Lumpy\" by everyone in town, and a daughter named Violet,\nplayed by Veronica Cartwright. Fred in public considers Clarence a model son\nand defends him whenever he is blamed for troublesome activities. He is\nshocked if \"his boy\" misbehaves. Privately, however, Fred calls his son a \"big\nboob.\" Clarence initially bullies both Wally and Beaver but eventually becomes\none of Wally's pals. In the show's third episode, \"The Black Eye\", Fred is the\nfather of two older sons, both nominated for football scholarships. Fred is\nWard's suit-wearing office co-worker and friend. He often gets on Ward's\nnerves, but the patient Ward, played by Hugh Beaumont, usually tolerates Fred\nwell. Fred often addresses Ward as \"Ward, old man\"; Ward is thirteen years\nolder than Fred. The two work for a \"big company\" with the home office in New\nYork City. Fred drops by the Cleaver house occasionally on either work matters\nor social calls. If trouble brews between the Cleaver and Rutherford children,\nFred either makes a phone call or appears at the Cleaver's door to advise\nWard; and, usually implies the Cleaver kids are likely at fault. In one\nepisode, the Cleavers have the Rutherfords in for cards. Fred plays golf at a\nlocal country club, sometimes accompanied by the reluctant Ward. Like Lumpy,\nFred is self-aggrandizing. In the pilot episode \"It's a Small World\", Richard\nDeacon plays a character named \"Mr. Baxter\", an employee for the \"Franklin\nMilk Co.\" Beginning in Leave It To Beaver's fifth season which launched in\nSeptember 1961, Fred Rutherford began appearing less often in episodes because\nRichard Deacon began appearing as a regular on The Dick Van Dyke Show. He\nreprised the role in the 1983 reunion television movie, Still the Beaver, but\nDeacon died before the spinoff television series The New Leave It to Beaver\nwas launched in 1985. By that time, Clarence and Beaver have started their own\nbusiness.\n\n## References\n\n  * Applebaum, Irwyn. The World According to Beaver. TV Books, 1984, 1998. ().\n  * Bank, Frank.

      "# Oriental Bank of Commerce\n\nOriental Bank of Commerce ( ) is an Indian public sector bank. Headquartered\nat Gurgaon, Haryana, has 2390 branches and 2625 ATMs across India.\n\n## History\n\nRai Bahadur Lala Sohan Lal the first Chairman of the Bank, founded OBC in 1943\nin Lahore. Within four years of its coming into existence, OBC had to face\nPartition. The bank had to close down its branches in the newly formed\nPakistan and shift its registered office from Lahore to Amritsar. Lala Karam\nChand Thapar, the then Chairman of the Bank, in a unique gesture honoured the\ncommitments made to the depositors from Pakistan and paid every rupee to its\ndeparting customers. The Bank has witnessed many ups and downs since its\nestablishment. The period of 1970-76 is said to be the most challenging phase\nin the history of the Bank. At one time profit plummeted to 175, that prompted\nthe owner of the bank, the Thapar Group, to sell / close the bank. Then\nemployees and leaders of the Bank came forward to rescue the Bank. The owners\nwere moved and had to change their decision of selling the bank and in turn\nthey decided to improve the position of the bank with the active cooperation\nand support of all the employees. Their efforts bore fruits and performance of\nthe bank improved significantly. This was the turning point in the history of\nthe bank. The bank was nationalised on 15 April 1980. At that time OBC ranked\n19th among the 20 nationalised banks. In 1997, OBC acquired Bari Doab Bank and\nPunjab Cooperative Bank. The acquisition of these two banks brought with it no\nadditional branches. The bank has progressed on several fronts, crossing the\nBusiness Mix mark of 2 lac crores as on 31 March 2010 making it the seventh\nlargest Public Sector Bank in India. On 14 August 2004, OBC amalgamated Global\nTrust Bank (GTB). GTB was a leading private sector bank in India that was\nassociated with various financial discrepancies leading to a moratorium being\nimposed by RBI shortly before it merged into OBC. The acquisition brought with\nit 103 branches, which increased OBC's branch total to 1092. As per March\n2018-2019 annual report, it has 2390 branches and 2625 ATMs pan India. On 30\nAugust 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the Oriental\nBank of Commerce and United Bank of India would be merged with Punjab National\nBank. The proposed merger would make Punjab National Bank the second largest\npublic sector bank in the country with assets of and 11,437 branches. MD and\nCEO of United Bank, Ashok Kumar Pradhan, stated that the merged entity would\nbegin functioning from 1 April 2020 and would operate under a new name.\n\n## Chairpersons\n\nThe Chairpersons (CMD) of the bank were as under:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe bank offers a wide range of banking products and services such as deposit\naccounts, loans, debit cards, credit cards (with tie up with SBI), Insurance\nproducts, ATMs, Internet banking, Mobile Banking, Self-banking halls, call\ncentre, etc. The Bank has launched yet another people's participation in the\nplanning process at grass root level essentially to tackle the maladies of\npoverty. The Grameen Projects venture aims to alleviate poverty plus identify\nthe reasons responsible for the failure or success. OBC is already\nimplementing a Grameen Project in Dehradun District (UK) and Hanumangarh\nDistrict (Rajasthan). Formulated on the pattern of the Bangladesh Grameen\nBank, the Scheme has a unique feature of disbursing small loans ranging from\n75 (~US $1.50) onwards. The beneficiaries of the Grameen Project are mostly\nwomen. The Bank is engaged in providing training to rural folk in using\nlocally available raw material to produce pickles, jams etc. This has provided\nself-employment and augmented income levels thus reforming lives of rural folk\nand encouraging cottage industries in rural areas. OBC launched yet another\nunique scheme christened 'The Comprehensive Village Development Programme' on\nthe auspicious day of Baisakhi, the 13th of April 1997 at three villages in\nPunjab namely Rurki Kalan (District. Sangrur), Raje Majra (District. Ropar)\nand Khaira Majha (District. Jaladhar) and two villages in Haryana, namely\nKhunga (District. Jind) and Narwal (District. Kaithal). The pilot launch was a\ngreat success. Emboldened by the success, Bank extended the programme to more\nvillages. At present, it covers 15 villages; 10 in Punjab, 4 in Haryana and 1\nin Rajasthan. The programme focuses on providing a comprehensive and\nintegrated package providing rural finance to the villagers with Village\nDevelopment as its focus, thus contributing towards infrastructural\ndevelopment and augmentation of income for each farmer of the village. The\nBank has implemented 14 point action plan for strengthening of credit delivery\nto women and has designated 5 branches as specialised branches for women\nentrepreneurs.\n\n## Notes, citations, and references\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n* Annual Report 2019 \n* Baker, Henry D.

Four years later, in\n1965, the Government of Pakistan took over the bank's branches in Pakistan. On\n19 July 1969, the Government of India nationalised UBI, along with 13 other\nmajor Indian commercial banks. At the time of nationalisation UBI had only 174\nbranches. In 1973, UBI acquired Hindustan Mercantile Bank (est. 1944). In\n1976, UBI acquired Narang Bank of India, which had been established in 1943 in\nNarang, Gujarat. On 30 August 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\nannounced that United Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce would be merged with\nPunjab National Bank.

      "# Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare (formerly Ministry of\nAgriculture), a branch of the Government of India, is the apex body for\nformulation and administration of the rules and regulations and laws related\nto agriculture in India. The three broad areas of scope for the Ministry are\nagriculture, food processing and co-operation. The agriculture ministry is\nheaded by Minister of Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar. Abhishek Singh\nChauhan, Krishna Raj and Parsottambhai Rupala are the Ministers of State.\nAgriculture is the principal source of livelihood for more than half\npopulation of India. Agriculture provides the bulk of wage goods required by\nnon-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries\nsector. India is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population\nestimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors\nin 2009-10.|Economic Survey|2010 The combined efforts of Central Government,\nState Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record\nproduction of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11. This record\nproduction has been achieved through effective transfer of newly developed\ncrop production technologies to farmers under various crop development\nschemes, such as the [Agriculture MMP], which is run under the direction of\nthe Department of Agriculture & Cooperation. Other causes behind record\nproduction include remunerative prices for various crops through enhanced\nminimum support prices.\n\n## Origins\n\nDepartment of Revenue and Agriculture and Commerce was set up in June 1871 to\ndeal with all the agricultural matters in India. Until this ministry was\nestablished, matters related to agriculture were within the portfolio of the\nHome Department. In 1881, Department of Revenue & Agriculture was set up to\ndeal with combined portfolios of education, health, agriculture, revenue.\nHowever, In 1947, Department of Agriculture was redesignated as Ministry of\nAgriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture was renamed as the Ministry for\nAgriculture and Farmers' Welfare on August 15, 2015 with a view to take care\nof farming community needs.\n\n## Structure and departments\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare consists of the following two\ndepartments.\n\n  * Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare. This Department's responsibilities are assigned to it in the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 as amended time to time. Co-operation in this context refers largely to promote farmer co-operative movements. The Agriculture MMP is another program run by this depart that aims to replicate the agricultural e-governance projects being carried in different states at a national level and through a variety of media.\n  * Department of Agriculture Research and Education. This Department's responsibilities are basic and operation research, technology development, improving linkages between various organisations and state governments across the country. In addition, this Department manages the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.\n\nThe administrative head of the Ministry are the Secretaries of the three\ndepartments.\n\n## Programs\n\nA leading program of the Ministry is the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, which\nwas launched in 2007 on the recommendations of the National Development\nCouncil of India. This program sought to improve the overall state of\nagriculture in India by providing stronger planning, better co-ordination and\ngreater funding to improve productivity and overall output. The total budget\nfor this program in 2009-10 was just over INR 38,000 crore.\n\n## Reports and statistics\n\nThe Ministry publishes an annual report titled \"Agricultural Statistics At a\nGlance\". This gives a detailed picture of the state of the India's agriculture\nincluding demographics of the agrarian sector, crop production (including\nstate-wise and crop-wise break-ups), rural economic indicators such as credit,\netc. The latest report has been published for 2014.\n\n## List of Ministers of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare\n\n## See also\n\n  * Agricultural insurance in India\n  * National Portal of India\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare\n  * Directory of Ministry of Agriculture websites\n  * India Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR)\n  * Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices\n  * Plant Quarantine Organisation of India\n  * National Seeds Corporation Limited\n  * Krishi India Expo\n  * Soil Health Card Portal\n  * Fertilizer Quality Control System (FQCS)\n  * Participatory Guarantee System\n\n",
      "# National Archives of India\n\nThe National Archives of India (NAI) is a repository of the non-current\nrecords of the Government of India and holds them in trust for the use of\nadministrators and scholars. Originally established as the Imperial Record\nDepartment in 1891, in Calcutta, the capital of British India, the NAI is\nsituated at the intersection of Janpath and Rajpath, in Delhi. It functions as\nan Attached Office of the Department of Culture under the Ministry of Culture,\nGovernment of India.\n\n## History\n\nThe Imperial Record Department was set up on 11 March 1891 in Calcutta\n(Kolkata). G.W. Forrest was named as department head. In 1911 it was\ntransferred to the new capital, New Delhi, and in 1926 it was shifted into its\nnew building. This was one of four museum and archive buildings planned by its\narchitect Edwin Lutyens around 'Point B' in the city plan, the intersection of\nKing's Way and Queen's Way. However, only this one was built. It is a building\nin late neo-classical style, and originally known as the Imperial Record\nOffice. Shri K.R. Narayanan, then President of India, declared the \"Museum of\nthe National Archives\" open to the general public on 6 July 1998. This museum\nprovides a representative overview of the multifarious holdings of the\nNational Archives, and promotes a common man's interest in archival holdings.\nThe NAI has a Regional Office at Bhopal and three Record Centres at\nBhubaneswar, Jaipur and Pondicherry.\n\n## Records\n\nThe holdings in the National Archives are in a regular series starting from\nthe year 1748. The languages of the records include English, Arabic, Hindi,\nPersian, Sanskrit, Modi and Urdu, and their materials include paper, palm\nleaf, birch bark and parchment. The records are in four categories: Public\nRecords, Oriental Records, Manuscripts and Private Papers. There has been a\ncertain amount of criticism regarding the lack of care taken in preservation\nand handling of records.\n\n## Exhibitions\n\nThe National Archives of India also holds regular exhibitions such as the\ndisplay of declassified files on Subhash Chandra Bose in 2016 and the recent\nexhibition, \"The Jammu and Kashmir Saga\", commemorating 70 years of Jammu and\nKashmir's accession to India which was held from 10 January 2018 to 10\nFebruary 2018.

      "# Home Run Derby\n\nThe Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting competition in Major League\nBaseball (MLB) customarily held the day before the MLB All-Star Game, which\nplaces the contest on a Monday in July. Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the\nevent has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based\ncompetition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.\n\n## History\n\nThe event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was not\ntelevised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-inning\nevent with each player receiving five outs per inning, allowing for the\npossibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on\nESPN. In 2000, a \"match play\"-style format was instituted for the second\nround. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player\nwith the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the\nsecond- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to\nthe finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition. The field\nof players selected currently consists of four American League players and\nfour National League players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each\nleague, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each\nleague, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players,\nwith five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the\nNL's four). In 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league\nformat. The only exception was 2005, when Major League Baseball changed the\nselection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries\ninstead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in\npromotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic, played in March 2006. In\n2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the\nformat was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides. Some\nnotable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005, who won the\nDerby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first\nround. The first-round record was broken in 2019 by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who\nhit 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home\nruns in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by\nGiancarlo Stanton, who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating Todd\nFrazier in the final round. The current overall record is held by Vladimir\nGuerrero Jr. at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only two participants, Yoenis\nC\u00e9spedes and Giancarlo Stanton, have won the Home Run Derby without being\nselected to the All-Star Game.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Format\n\n8 players duel in a home run challenge.\n\n#### 1985\u20131990\n\nIn the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players from both the AL and NL\nwere selected to participate. Each player was given 2 \"innings\" to hit as many\nhome runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. For the derby, an out is defined\nas any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player\nwith the most total home runs in the two innings.\n\n#### 1991\u20132005\n\nBeginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991\u20132006,\n8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before\nreaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top\nfour advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final. In\nhonor of the World Baseball Classic, the 2005 contest featured eight players\nfrom different countries. The format remained the same.\n\n#### 2006\u20132013\n\nThe format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each\nround, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with\nthe four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players\nwith the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.\n\n#### 2014\n\nThe Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to\nspeed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five\nplayers from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1,\nwith each players having seven \"outs.\" The player in each league with the\nhighest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the\nsecond- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round\n2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner\ncrowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each\nround stands alone, with the score reset for each round. Ties in any round are\nbroken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players remain tied, the players engage\nin a sudden-death swing-off until one player homers.\n\n#### 2015\u2013Present\n\nThe format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant change was the\nelimination of \"outs\", which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are\nseeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit\nas many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup\nadvances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up,\ntwo sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the\nwinner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is\ndetermined. Further, a player can get \"bonus time\" in the last minute of each\nround. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not\nrestart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time\ncould be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring\nat least are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of\nbonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over . Weather\nconcerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to\nfour minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of\nbonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least . The four-\nminute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time\nwas reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least . The\nadditional time was removed. Each batter is allowed one time-out during each\nround, and two in the finals. For 2017 and 2018, the first tie-breaker was\nincreased from a 1-minute swing off to minutes. However, it was not needed\neither of these years. The swing off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first\nyear in which it was used.\n\n### Gold balls\n\nFrom 2005\u20132013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in\n2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final\nminute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real\nEstate and Major League Baseball would donate $21,000 (a reference to the \"21\"\nin \"Century 21\") per home run to charity (MLB donated to the Boys and Girls\nClubs of America, and Century 21 donated to Easter Seals). In both 2005 and\n2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball\nhome runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated\n$17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the\nBoys and Girls Clubs of America. In the 2007 event, fifteen golden balls were\nhit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the 2008 event.\nFor 2009, State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000\nwas collected. For 2010, the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per\nhome run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since 2014 any homer hit off a\nT-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB,\nto Team Rubicon.\n\n## Television and radio coverage\n\nOn July 11, 1988, the day before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game from\nCincinnati, TBS televised the annual All-Star Gala from the Cincinnati Zoo.\nLarry King hosted the broadcast with Craig Sager and Pete Van Wieren handling\ninterviews. The broadcast's big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which\nTBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in prime time\nduring the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition\nwere canceled due to rain. The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in\n1993 on a same-day delayed basis, with the first live telecast in 1998.\nAlthough two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it\nhas rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to\nfour hours. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on\nESPN, including his catchphrase, \"Back back back\u2026Gone!\". Berman starts this\nphrase when the ball is hit, and does not say \"Gone!\" until the ball lands.\nThe 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic cable program. Because\nof the game's TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to\nparticipate. Notably, Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly declined to take part\nin 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game\nthe night before. After a discussion with ESPN's Joe Morgan and another with\nHall of Famer Frank Robinson, Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby\nat Coors Field. In Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network\nESPN Deportes. ESPN Radio also carries the event annually.\n\n### Most watched Home Run Derbys\n\n## Winners\n\n## Records\n\n### Most home runs in a single round\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs\n\n### Most single-derby home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Most all-time home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Wins by team\n\n## Complete scoreboard\n\n### 1980s\n\n#### 1985\n\n#### 1986\n\n#### 1987\n\n#### 1988\n\nHome Run Derby canceled due to rain.\n\n#### 1989\n\n### 1990s\n\n#### 1990\n\n#### 1991\n\n#### 1992\n\n#### 1993\n\n* Lost in playoff to Gonzalez \n\n#### 1994\n\n#### 1995\n\n* Beat Belle in finals \n\n#### 1996\n\n#### 1997\n\n* Beat Walker in finals \n\n#### 1998\n\n#### 1999\n\n* Lost to Burnitz in round 2 \n\n### 2000s\n\n#### 2000\n\n#### 2001\n\n#### 2002\n\n* Giambi defeated Konerko in a swing off \n\n#### 2003\n\n#### 2004\n\n#### 2005\n\n#### 2006\n\n#### 2007\n\n#### 2008\n\n#### 2009\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010\n\n#### 2011\n\n#### 2012\n\n#### 2013\n\n#### 2014\n\n  * designates bye round.  \n\n(designates swing off home runs).\n\n#### 2015 Great American Ball Park (Cincinnati)\n\n#### 2016 Petco Park (San Diego)\n\n#### 2017 Marlins Park (Miami)\n\n#### 2018 Nationals Park (Washington)\n\n#### 2019 Progressive Field (Cleveland)\n\n* Round went into three swing-offs after Guerrero Jr. and Pederson were tied with 29 home runs each. \n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Major League Baseball All-Star Games\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * MLB.com: Home Run Derby History\n  * Baseball-Almanac.com: Home Run Derby Results and Analysis\n  * Baseball Research Journal, SABR, \"Home Run Derby Curse, Fact or Fiction?\" by Joseph McCollum and Marcus Jaiclin\n\n"

      "# List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\n\nIn baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter\nis able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any\nrunners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An\nautomatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the\noutfield fence in fair territory. More rarely, an inside-the-park home run\noccurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play\non the field. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the\nhome run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year. Only home\nruns hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead.\nMark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other\nplayer that year. However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL)\nOakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway\nthrough the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24,\nrespectively) did not qualify to lead either league. The first home run\nchampion in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural\n1876 season, Hall hit five home runs for the short-lived National League\nPhiladelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall\nof Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 home runs for the American\nLeague Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 22-season career, Babe\nRuth led the American League in home runs 12 times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph\nKiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt\nwith eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven\nconsecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run\ntitles by any player. Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season home\nrun record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and\nfinally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are tied for the widest margin\nof victory for a home run champion as he topped the next highest total by 35\nhome runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years\nuntil Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years\nlater by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record\nchase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also\nhas the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in\n2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs \u2013\nGreg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez,\nLuis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs\n42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major\nleague was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in\n1878.\n\n## Key\n\n## American League\n\n## National League\n\n## Other major leagues\n\n## See also\n\n  * Babe Ruth Home Run Award (discontinued) \u2013 awarded to the MLB home-run leader\n  * Josh Gibson Legacy Award \u2013 awarded to the AL and NL home-run leaders\n  * Mel Ott Award \u2013 awarded to the NL home-run leader\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * Recognized \"major leagues\" include the current American and National Leagues and several defunct leagues \u2013 the American Association, the Federal League, the Players' League, and the Union Association.\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# Run batted in\n\nA run batted in (RBI), plural runs batted in (RBI or RBIs), is a statistic in\nbaseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a\nrun to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made\non the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit, then another player\non a higher base can head home to score a run, and the batter gets credited\nwith batting in that run. Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs\nbatted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI\nstatistic was tabulated\u2014unofficially\u2014from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer\nErnie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. Common\nnicknames for an RBI include \"ribby\" (or \"ribbie\"), \"rib\", and \"ribeye\". The\nplural of RBI is generally \"RBIs\", although some commentators use \"RBI\" as\nboth singular and plural, as it can also stand for \"runs batted in\".\n\n## Major League Baseball Rules\n\nThe 2018 edition of the Official Baseball Rules of Major League Baseball\n(MLB), Rule 9.04 Runs Batted In, reads: From 1980 to 1988, the game-winning\nRBI was an additional statistic used in MLB.\n\n## Criticism\n\nThe perceived significance of the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one\nof the three categories that compose the triple crown. In addition, career\nRBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of\nFame. However, critics, particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue\nthat RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player\nhimself. This is because an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or\nmore batters preceding him in the batting order have reached base (the\nexception to this being a home run, in which the batter is credited with\ndriving himself in, not just those already on base).

      "# Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\n\n\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\" is a science fiction short story by American\nwriter Ray Bradbury. It was originally published in the magazine Thrilling\nWonder Stories in August 1949, under the title \"The Naming of Names\". It was\nsubsequently included in the short-story collections A Medicine for Melancholy\nand S is for Space. The story takes place in the near future on Mars, as is\nthe case with many of Bradbury's stories.\n\n## Plot summary\n\nIn the midst of an atomic war on Earth, the United States sends a number of\ncolonists to establish an outpost on Mars. The Bittering family, father Harry\nand mother Cora and their children Dan, Laura, and David, arrives as part of\nthe eight hundred colonists chosen for the first wave. Harry is initially\ndisquieted by the Martian environment, but takes comfort in the fact that the\nfamily can return to Earth when resupply ships arrive. Strange events begin to\naffect the life brought as part of the settlement effort, including the seeded\ngrass sprouting purple, the family cow growing a third horn in the middle of\nits head, and other anomalies with the vegetable garden. Harry's discomfort on\nMars increases, and the thought of returning to Earth on the next resupply\nmission soon becomes his only comfort, much to the concern of Cora. This\ncomfort is taken away as Bittering is informed that the war has led to an\natomic bomb devastating New York City and destroying the only spaceport\ncapable of supporting travel to Mars. Resolving to build himself a rocket\nhome, Harry isolates himself from his family and the townsfolk, who have begun\nto show signs of transforming into Martians as their limbs and bodies\nelongate, their irises become shimmery gold, their skin darkens, and they\nbegin using Martian language, referring to Earth as Iorrt, the ancient Martian\nname for Earth. Harry staves off the transformation as he only consumes food\nand water brought from Earth, but the supplies run out and he is forced to eat\nMartian food to survive. Soon enough, Harry notices his eyes have turned gold.\nCows are growing 3 horns. Cora convinces Harry that a family swim in the\ncanals of Mars would do him good to relax, and he hesitantly agrees. While\nthere, their eldest son, Dan, requests to be referred to by the Martian name\nLinnl. Harry and Cora, now almost entirely Martian, agree easily, and the\nother two children quickly adopt Martian names as well. As they return to the\ntown, the Bitterings discover that the colonists are retreating to the ancient\nMartian villas in the mountains, as the summer has made the valley stiflingly\nhot. Harry briefly expresses a wish to stay and work on his rocket, but is\neasily persuaded to go with the rest of the colonists and come back when the\nweather is cooler. Five years later, the United States, having won the war and\nrebuilt New York, sends a small military dispatch to recover the colonists\nsent to Mars, only to find their settlement abandoned. The soldiers instead\nencounter a large Martian settlement in the mountain villas, where the native\nMartians are pleasant and have a remarkable affinity for English. Convinced\nthey had nothing to do with the original colony's disappearance, the group\nagrees to attempt a second, larger settlement using the town built by the\nfirst.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThere was a bookshop of the same name.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Picanha\n\nPicanha is a cut of beef called sirloin cap in the United States or the rump\ncap in the United Kingdom, that is popular in Portugal and Brazil. In the\nUnited States, it is little known, but referred to as the rump cover, rump\ncap, or culotte. North American butchers generally divide it into other cuts\nlike the rump, the round, and the loin. It consists of the M. biceps femoris\nmuscle and its fat cap.\n\n## In Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the most prized cut of meat tends to be the picanha. There, the fat\nis retained until the steak has been cooked. In the United States, however, it\ntends to be removed unless requested otherwise by the customer.\n\n## History\n\nThe term \"picanha\" derives from the word \"picana\", which was a pole used by\nranchers in the southern parts of Portugal and Spain, particularly in\nAlentejo, for herding cattle.

Ribeye steaks are mostly composed of\nthe longissimus dorsi muscle but also contain the complexus and spinalis\nmuscles.\n\n## Variants\n\nA rib steak is a beef steak sliced from the rib primal of a beef animal, with\nrib bone attached. In the United States, the term rib eye steak or Spencer\nsteak is used for a rib steak with the bone removed; however in some areas,\nand outside the U.S., the terms are often used interchangeably. The rib eye or\n\"ribeye\" was originally, as the name implies, the center best portion of the\nrib steak, without the bone. In Australia and New Zealand, \"ribeye\" is used\nwhen this cut is served with the bone in. With the bone removed, it is called\n\"Scotch fillet\". It is both flavorful and tender, coming from the lightly\nworked upper rib cage area. Its marbling of fat makes it very good for fast\nand hot cooking.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Beef ribs\n  * Cheesesteak\n  * Delmonico\n  * Entrec\u00f4te\n  * List of steak dishes\n  * Prime rib\n\n## Sources\n\n  * recipe\n\n## External links\n\n  * USDA Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications\n  * \"Picture and Diagram of beef cuts\"\n  * National Cattlemen's Beef Association\n\n"

      "# Don't You Lie to Me\n\n\"Don't You Lie to Me\" (sometimes called \"I Get Evil\") is a blues song recorded\nby Tampa Red in 1940. It became a standard of the blues, with recordings by\nvarious artists. The song was also interpreted by rock and roll pioneers Fats\nDomino and Chuck Berry.\n\n## Original song\n\n\"Don't You Lie to Me\" was recorded by Tampa Red approximately midpoint in his\nprolific recording career, representing the transition from his earlier hokum\nrecordings to his later early Chicago-blues combo style. This was the same\nperiod when he began playing the electric guitar and recorded his best-known\nblues classics, including \"It Hurts Me Too\", \"Love with a Feeling\", and \"Anna\nLou Blues\", the B-side of \"Don't You Lie to Me\". The song is a mid-tempo\ntwelve-bar blues that features Tampa Red playing jazz-inflected single-note\nguitar fills behind his vocals. Blind John Davis provided the piano\naccompaniment with an unidentified bass player and, as a throwback to his\nearlier days, Red added a twelve-bar kazoo solo. Although many later versions\nare credited to other artists, they usually use some, if not most, of Tampa\nRed's lyrics:\n\n## Recordings by other artists\n\nFats Domino recorded \"Don't You Lie to Me\" early in his career in 1951\n(Imperial 5123). He used most of Tampa Red's lyrics and, although there is a\nfull backing band, his trademark piano accompaniment dominates the recording.\nDomino received sole credit for the song, as did Chuck Berry when he recorded\na rock and roll version for his 1961 album New Juke-Box Hits. The Rolling\nStones recorded Berry's version in 1964, which was not released until their\nMetamorphosis album in 1975; in 1972 they performed the song in concert. The\nPretty Things also recorded Berry's version for their 1965 self-titled debut\nalbum. In 1962, Albert King recorded \"Don't You Lie to Me\" as \"I Get Evil\"\n(Bobbin 135), which was included on his first album The Big Blues. King's\nversion uses an Afro-Cuban style rhythm, which he would later use for his 1967\nhit \"Crosscut Saw\". Later, King with Stevie Ray Vaughan recorded it live for\ntelevision in 1983, which is included on Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan\nin Session. In 1977, B.B. King recorded the song for his King Size album. Gary\nMoore recorded it using both titles \"Don't You Lie to Me (I Get Evil)\", which\nfollows Albert King's version, for his 1992 After Hours album. The Flamin'\nGroovies also recorded a version of the song, which was released as a single\nin the UK in 1976. Supertramp also recorded it for their Live '88 album.\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# I'm in Love with My Car\n\n\"I'm in Love with My Car\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released\non their fourth album A Night at the Opera in 1975. It is the album's only\nsong written entirely by drummer Roger Taylor.\n\n## History\n\nTaylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later rerecorded\nby May on his Red Special and Taylor also doubled on electric guitar in\naddition to drums. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio\nversion and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion\nof the song were a recording of Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The\nlyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose\nTriumph TR4 was evidently the \"love of his life\". The song is dedicated to\nhim, with the liner notes mentioning, \"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy\nracer to the end\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single,\nTaylor was so fond of his song that he urged Freddie Mercury (author of the\nfirst single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") to allow it to be the B-side and locked\nhimself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become\nthe cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the\nB-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the\nmain single did for Mercury simply because it was the B-side to \"Bohemian\nRhapsody\". The song was often played live during the 1977\u201381 period. Taylor\nsang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals.\nDuring the News of the World Tour, Mercury would often sing the chorus lines\nwith Taylor. The song was used in a 2004 advertisement for Jaguar. The song's\ntitle is used as a running joke in the 2018 Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody,\nstarting with an argument between Taylor (Ben Hardy) and May (Gwilym Lee) over\nthe song's lyrical content. Later in the film, EMI executive Ray Foster (Mike\nMyers) suggests to have it or \"You're My Best Friend\" released as the first\nsingle to A Night at the Opera instead of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Shortly\nafterwards, on Kenny Everett's radio show, Freddie Mercury hands the single to\nthe eponymous host, who then reads out \"I'm In Love With My Car\" rather than\nBohemian Rhapsody, which is then correctly played on air. The song was also\nfeatured in Amazon Prime's 2019 series, Good Omens.\n\n## Reception\n\nMusic writer Tom Reynolds described the song as \"seriously, one of the\ngreatest and most passionate love songs I've heard during the last thirty-plus\nyears\". AllMusic appreciated it as a \"solid, hard hitting rocker\" from Taylor.\nThey observed, \"The music lives up to the macho tone of the lyrics by matching\nup verses that swagger in a midtempo hard rock style\", regarding it as an\n\"album highlight\".\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Roger Taylor \u2013 lead and backing vocals, drums, rhythm guitar\n  * Freddie Mercury \u2013 piano, backing vocals\n  * Brian May \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\n  * John Deacon \u2013 bass guitar\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Lyrics at Queen official website\n\n",
      "# Bless the Beasts and Children (song)\n\n\"Bless the Beasts and Children\" is the theme song to the 1971 eponymous film\nand was performed by the Carpenters. It was featured on the B-side to their\nhit, \"Superstar\". The B-side charted on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually\ntopping out at #67. In order to promote it, The Carpenters performed it on\ntheir television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, as \"F\" for \"Film Music\".\nIt was nominated for a 1972 Academy Award for Best Song, but it lost to Isaac\nHayes' \"Theme from Shaft\". The original soundtrack included two different\nversions of \"Bless the Beasts and Children\", the other being an orchestral\ninstrumental arrangement by composers Barry DeVorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr.,\nand the original \"Nadia's Theme\", which was listed as \"Cotton's Dream\".\n\"Cotton's Dream\" was also used as the theme song to the 1973 soap opera, The\nYoung and the Restless, and later \"Bless the Beasts and Children\" was used\nwhen David Hasselhoff's character, Dr. \"Snapper\" Foster, had to say goodbye to\nhis son in a dramatic 1982 episode of the series. The song was originally\nreleased on the original soundtrack, and a slightly different version was\nreleased on the Carpenters' 1972 LP, A Song for You on June 13, 1972. The\noriginal soundtrack had a vibraphone playing the melody in the introduction,\nwhile the A Song for You version, released on the single, contained an oboe\nstating the melody. The two versions (soundtrack and album versions) faded out\ntoward the end, but in 1985, Richard Carpenter re-mixed the song so it does\nnot fade out in the end. He also added a harder bass-line. Barry De Vorzon\ncomposed the song at a residence in Lake Arrowhead, California, where he used\nto spend his weekends, after director Stanley Kramer gave him the screenplay\nof the film. At first he wrote a \"beautiful melody\" and then \"loaded the lyric\nwith all the terrible things we're doing to children and animals,\" but it \"did\nnot work.\" The next day he change them to simpler lyrics that call to protect\ntheir innocence.\n\n## Chart history\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Karen Carpenterlead and backing vocals\n  * Richard Carpenterbacking vocals, piano, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer electric piano, orchestration\n  * Joe Osbornbass guitar\n  * Hal Blainedrums\n  * Tony Pelusoelectric fuzz guitar\n  * Earl Dumleroboe, English horn\n  * Uncreditedvibraphone, tambourine, temple blocks\n\n## References\n\n",

In addition, the line \"bend over to the front and touch your\ntoes\" was reused in Usher's 2004 song \"Yeah!\", on which Lil Jon and Ludacris\nprovided the rap vocals.

      "# Area code 202\n\nArea code 202 is the North American telephone area code for Washington, DC.\nThe area code was one of the original area codes established in October 1947\nby AT&T; in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). After the State of New\nJersey with area code 201, the District of Columbia was the second Numbering\nPlan Area (NPA). NPAs that covered an entire administrative region received a\ncode in which the second digit was '0'. As of 2019, no immediate plans exist\nto overlay the 202 area code (a split would be impossible due to the fact it\nis a single rate center), as NANPA estimates the current supply of numbers is\nsufficient at least to the year 2022. Washington is thus one of the largest\ncities where seven-digit dialing is still possible. However, calls are\nconnected if the area code is dialed. There is no provision for long-distance\ncalls within the area code. From the 1950s to 1990, area code 202 was an\nunpublished alternate area code for the nearby suburbs in Maryland and\nVirginia, which were officially in area codes 301 and 703, respectively. This\narrangement permitted seven-digit dialing of local calls throughout the\nmetropolitan area. One side effect was that a central office prefix could only\nbe duplicated in jurisdictions a safe distance from the metropolitan area,\nsuch as the Eastern Shore of Maryland or southwestern Virginia. However, on\nOctober 1, 1990, this arrangement was terminated because of pending number\nexhaustion throughout the area. This did not free up enough numbers to meet\ndemand on either side of the Potomac River, forcing the split of area code 410\nfrom 301 in 1991 and the split of area code 540 from 703 in 1995. The region's\ncontinued growth in the 1990s ultimately resulted in the suburban area codes\nbeing overlaid, with 301 being overlaid with 240 in 1997 and 703 being\noverlaid with 571 in 2000. Years after the introduction of mobile number\nportability, many cell phone customers on the Virginia and Maryland sides of\nthe metro have 202 numbers.\n\n## Local calling\n\nEven with the implementation of ten-digit dialing in the Washington metro, 202\nis still the center of one of the largest toll-free calling zones in the\neastern United States. Areas such as Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls\nChurch, McLean and Tysons in Virginia (703/571) and Rockville, Gaithersburg,\nUpper Marlboro, Bethesda and Landover in Maryland (301/240) are a local call\nto Washington.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Area code 710\n  * List of North American Numbering Plan area codes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Virginia Plan\n\nThe Virginia Plan (also known as the Randolph Plan, after its sponsor, or the\nLarge-State Plan) was a proposal by Virginia delegates for a bicameral\nlegislative branch. The plan was drafted by James Madison while he waited for\na quorum to assemble at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The Virginia\nPlan was notable for its role in setting the overall agenda for debate in the\nconvention and, in particular, for setting forth the idea of population-\nweighted representation in the proposed national legislature. It existed\nalongside the New Jersey Plan for the structure of the United States\ngovernment, which was formed in response to the Virginia Plan to protect small\nstates' interests.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Constitutional Convention gathered in Philadelphia to revise the Articles\nof Confederation. The Virginia delegation took the initiative to frame the\ndebate by immediately drawing up and presenting a proposal, for which delegate\nJames Madison is given chief credit. However, it was Edmund Randolph, the\nVirginia governor at the time, who officially put it before the convention on\nMay 29, 1787, in the form of 15 resolutions. The scope of the resolutions,\ngoing well beyond tinkering with the Articles of Confederation, succeeded in\nbroadening the debate to encompass fundamental revisions to the structure and\npowers of the national government. The resolutions proposed, for example, a\nnew form of national government having three branches (legislative, executive\nand judicial). One contentious issue facing the convention was the manner in\nwhich large and small states would be represented in the legislature:\nproportionate to population, with larger states having more votes than less-\npopulous states, or by equal representation for each state, regardless of its\nsize and population. The latter system more closely resembled that of the\nArticles of Confederation, under which each state was represented by one vote\nin a unicameral legislature.\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Virginia Plan proposed a legislative branch consisting of two chambers\n(bicameral legislature), with the dual principles of rotation in office and\nrecall applied to the lower house of the national legislature. Each of the\nstates would be represented in proportion to their \"Quotas of contribution, or\nto the number of free inhabitants.\" States with a large population, like\nVirginia (which was the most populous state at the time), would thus have more\nrepresentatives than smaller states. Large states supported this plan, and\nsmaller states generally opposed it, preferring an alternative put forward on\nJune 15. The New Jersey Plan proposed a single-chamber legislature in which\neach state, regardless of size, would have one vote, as under the Articles of\nConfederation. In the end, the convention settled on the Connecticut\nCompromise, creating a House of Representatives apportioned by population and\na Senate in which each state is equally represented. In addition to dealing\nwith legislative representation, the Virginia Plan addressed other issues as\nwell, with many provisions that did not make it into the Constitution that\nemerged. It called for a national government of three branches: legislative,\nexecutive, and judicial. Members of one of the two legislative chambers would\nbe elected by the people; members of that chamber would then elect the second\nchamber from nominations submitted by state legislatures. The executive would\nbe chosen by the legislative branch. Terms of office were not specified, but\nthe executive and members of the popularly elected legislative chamber could\nnot be elected for an undetermined time afterward. Additionally, the plan\nproposed that the legislative branch would have the power to veto state laws\nif they were deemed incompatible with the articles of union, or the states\nwere deemed incompetent. The concept of checks and balances was embodied in a\nprovision that legislative acts could be vetoed by a council composed of the\nexecutive and selected members of the judicial branch; their veto could be\noverridden by an unspecified legislative majority.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nThe Virginia Plan and the debate surrounding it are prominently featured in\nthe 1989 film A More Perfect Union, which depicts the events of the 1787\nConstitutional Convention. Presented largely from the viewpoint and words of\nJames Madison, the movie was mainly filmed in Independence Hall.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Come to the Sunshine\n\n\"Come to the Sunshine\" is a song written and recorded by Van Dyke Parks and\ncovered by several other artists. It was one of two 45rpm singles Parks would\nissue through the MGM label in 1966 before moving to Warner Bros. the\nfollowing year.\n\n## Composition\n\nIt was composed in the summer of 1965 while Parks was living in the rear\napartment at 7222 1/2 Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. The arrangement is\ncharacteristically jumbled, featuring multiple overlapping vocals by Parks, as\nwell as a jazzy piano and a busy mandolin. He's said it to have been inspired\nby Snuff Garrett\u2019s \"50 Guitars Go South of the Border\" and his father\u2019s\nDepression-era dance band The White Swan Serenaders. It was written especially\nfor his father, in honor of \"what he was doing at the time.\" Parks added, \"I\nthought that he would think it was very wonderful, and I don't think he\nthought it was very wonderful.\" The lyrics at the time were oblique, atypical\nfor pop music in 1966, and was one of the many songs heralding the imminent\n1960s psychedelic era. It would signify many things to come for Parks,\nincluding his lyrical collaborations with The Beach Boys aborted Smile album\nand his 1967 solo debut Song Cycle. It was recorded in one day and in just\nthree takes, along with his other singles released on his short tenure with\nthe MGM label. The B-side was \"Farther Along\", which was in a similar sunshine\npop style as \"Come to the Sunshine\". Parks has reflected of the song years\nlater, exclaiming \"it was a good work! A fine example of plectrum arranging.\"\nRecord producer and friend Michael Vosse recounted in 1969, \"It was completed\nat least three months before all the other 'Sunshine' records came out\u2014like\nthe Beatles thing (\"Good Day Sunshine\") and \"Sunshine Superman\". I mean, it\nwas recorded in March or something and MGM didn't want to put it out until\nSeptember. Just neglected it. And they did that twice in a row to him.\"\n\n## Release history\n\nThe song as it was recorded by Parks in 1966 remained out of print for many\nyears, and is a rare, sought after collector's item. It was included on the\n2011 Parks compilation Arrangements, Volume 1, alongside other rarities such\nas \"The Eagle And Me\", \"Farther Along\", \"Out On The Rolling Sea When Jesus\nSpeak To Me\", and the mono single mix of \"Donovan's Colours\".\n\n## Covers\n\n  * 1967 \u2013 Warner Bros. sunshine pop group Harpers Bizarre, as the opening track on their debut album, Feelin' Groovy.

It is likely\nthe first of Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52 (however,\nsome scholars believe the Epistle to Galatians may have been written at an\nearlier date: AD 48).\n\n## Composition\n\nMost New Testament scholars believe Paul the Apostle wrote this letter from\nCorinth, although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts\n(e.g., Codices Alexandrinus, Mosquensis, and Angelicus) state that Paul wrote\nit in Athens after Timothy had returned from Macedonia with news of the state\nof the church in Thessalonica (; ). For the most part, the letter is personal\nin nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of\ndoctrine, almost as an aside. Paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage\nand reassure the Christians there. Paul urges them to go on working quietly\nwhile waiting in hope for the return of Christ.\n\n### Date\n\nUnlike all subsequent Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on\njustification by faith or questions of Jewish\u2013Gentile relations, themes that\nare covered in all other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that\nthis letter was written before the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul's\npositions on these matters were formed and elucidated.\n\n### Authenticity\n\nThe majority of New Testament scholars hold 1 Thessalonians to be authentic,\nalthough a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its\nauthenticity, most notably Clement Schrader and F.C. Baur. 1 Thessalonians\nmatches other accepted Pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its\nauthorship is also affirmed by 2 Thessalonians.\n\n  * It is perceived to be theologically incompatible with Paul's other epistles: elsewhere Paul attributed Jesus's death to the \"rulers of this age\" (1 Cor 2:8) rather than to the Jews, and elsewhere Paul writes that the Jews have not been abandoned by God, for \"all Israel will be saved\" (Rom 11:26); According to 1 Thes 1:10, the wrath of God is still to come; it is not something that has already shown itself.\n  * There were no extensive historical persecutions of Christians by Jews in Palestine prior to the first Jewish war.\n  * The use of the concept of imitation in 1 Thes. 2.14 is singular.\n  * The aorist eftasen (\"has overtaken\") refers to the destruction of Jerusalem.\n  * The syntax of 1 Thes. 2:13\u201316 deviates significantly from that of the surrounding context.\n\nIt is also sometimes suggested that 1 Thes. 5:1\u201311 is a post-Pauline insertion\nthat has many features of Lukan language and theology that serves as an\napologetic correction to Paul's imminent expectation of the Second Coming in 1\nThes. 4:13\u201318. Other scholars, such as Schmithals, Eckhart, Demke and Munro,\nhave developed complicated theories involving redaction and interpolation in 1\nand 2 Thessalonians.\n\n### Audience\n\nPaul claimed the title of the \"Apostle to the Gentiles\", and established\ngentile churches in several important cities in the Roman Empire. According to\nBart D. Ehrman, the Acts of the Apostles tells a different story of Paul's\ncareer, but in this case it reports that, while there were \"some\" Jews\nconverted during Paul's initial preaching in Thessalonica, the gentiles who\nwere converted were \"a large number\" and the Jews as a body fiercely opposed\nPaul's work there.\n\n## Contents\n\n### Outline\n\n  1.

Paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself,\nreminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to\nburden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status\nas an apostle to impose upon them. Paul goes on to explain that the dead will\nbe resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the\nLord in the air.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Authorship of the Pauline epistles\n  * Imitation of Christ\n  * Second Epistle to the Thessalonians\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Epistles to the Thessalonians entry in the Catholic Encyclopedia\n  * Online Bible at GospelHall.org\n  * Various versions\n\n"

      "# Hindhead Tunnel\n\nThe Hindhead Tunnel, opened in 2011, is part of the dual-carriageway Hindhead\nbypass that replaced one of the last remaining stretches of single-carriageway\non the A3, the London to Portsmouth road. The bypass was constructed to\nimprove road safety, reduce congestion and improve air quality. At in length,\nthe tunnel is the longest non-estuarial road tunnel in the United Kingdom, and\ntakes the road beneath the Devil's Punch Bowl, a Site of Special Scientific\nInterest.\n\n## History\n\nA naval dockyard has existed in Portsmouth since at least Tudor times, giving\nsignificant importance to the road linking that city with London. The original\nroute skirted the north-western limits of The Weald climbing to the summit of\nGibbet Hill close to Hindhead. In 1826 the road was rebuilt around the Devil's\nPunch Bowl to ensure that the gradient was no more than 5%. The road became\npart of the A3 when road numbering was introduced in the 1920s. By the start\nof the new millennium most of the A3 had been dualled; of the route from\nSouthfields to Havant, only the section that passed through Hindhead and the\nDevil's Punch Bowl was still single carriageway. This section, which passed\nthrough an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), operated at or above\ncapacity for much of the day and had an accident rate 40% higher than the\nnational average for that class of road.\n\n## Design\n\nBy 2000 the A3 between Southfields and Havant had been built to dual\ncarriageway standards for its entire length apart from the Hindhead section\n(there are still sections of single carriageway within London and Portsmouth).\nThe termini of the northern and southern sections of dual carriageway were at\naltitudes of and above sea level respectively and the single carriageway\nlinking them followed a winding route around the Devil's Punch Bowl, reaching\nan altitude of . The Hindhead Tunnel project shortened the route by about and\nrouted the road through a tunnel whose northern and southern portals are at\naltitudes of and above sea level respectively.\n\n### Assessment of proposals\n\nThe need for improvements to the A3 through Hindhead had been recognised for\nmany years with a route study being undertaken between 1970 and 1976. In 1983\nsome nine alternatives for the A3 were investigated by the Department for\nTransport, but assessment showed that only one which went around the north and\nwest side of the Punch Bowl (the \"Red Route\"), crossing the Smallbrook Valley\nwas viable. A public consultation on the route met with opposition and two\nalternatives were suggested both of which drew less support than the proposed\nroute which in 1988 became the preferred route. Subsequent environmental\nsurveys showed that this route would have substantial adverse impacts\nresulting in the proposal to adapt an earlier scheme by including a tunnel to\navoid the most sensitive parts of the route. The scheme entered the\nGovernment\u2019s targeted programme of improvements in 2001. A public inquiry was\nheld in September 2004 to hear objections and to consider alternatives to the\nproposal. Among the alternative proposals was one for a surface route\nfollowing a more westerly line that would avoid building a tunnel (an\nadaptation of the \"Red Route\"). Despite being significantly more expensive\nthan building a surface road, a tunnel was preferred after two alternative\nsurface schemes were rejected on environmental grounds. The decision to put\npart of the road in a tunnel pushed the cost of the project to \u00a3371 million,\nwith the underground section costing \u00a3155,000 per metre (\u00a3142,000 per yard)\nmaking that section of road the second most expensive road in the UK per unit\ndistance, after the Limehouse Link tunnel.\n\n### Geology\n\nThe Hindhead tunnel runs through a sequence of fine grained strata of the\nLower Greensand Group that were laid over Wealden Clay during (part of the\nWealden Group) during the Lower Cretaceous period (70140 million years ago) on\nthe margins of the subsiding Weald Basin. The Greensand group consists of the\nHythe Beds, which overlay a layer of Atherfield Clay. The Hythe beds\nthemselves, which host the tunnel, consist of the Upper Hythe bed, which has a\nfour substrata identified by the letters \"A\" to \"D\", and the Lower Hythe bed,\nwhich has two strata which are identified by the letters \"A\" and \"B\".\nOriginally that whole area was covered by the Burgate Beds, but when the Weald\nwas uplifted, the Burgate Beds were eroded away. Most of the tunnel passes\nthrough the Upper Hythe C and D layers and the Lower Hythe A layer which are\ndescribed as \"Weak, locally very weak to moderately strong, slightly clayey\nfine to medium sandstone with occasional thin beds of clayey/silty fine sand\"\nand typically has Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) values of 2\u20135 MPa. The\nrock is heavily fractured and has mean fracture centres varying from . The\nsouthern end of the tunnel however passes through the \"less competent\" Upper\nHythe A and B layers which are described as \"medium dense thinly bedded and\nthinly laminated, clean to silty and clayey fine and medium sand with\nsubordinate weak to strong sandstone, cherty sandstone and chert\". Most of the\ntunnel is above the predicted water table.\n\n### Access and the old A3 road\n\nAccess to the new section of road from the north is via the original A3 with\naccess to the old A3 being provided from the Thursley Junction, completed in\n2005, about one kilometre beyond the northern limit of the Hindhead Tunnel\nworks. The new road can be accessed from the south using the original A3 with\nnew access points being provided by new junctions at Hazel Grove. After the\nconstruction was completed, the section of the old A3 from the A287\nintersection in Hindhead southwards was renamed the A333, the section from the\nintersection northwards up to the National Trust car park has been retained,\nand the section that follows the Devil's Punch Bowl contour has been returned\nto nature. The remainder of the old A3 was either converted to a cycle\ntrack/bridlepath or is being used as a local road.\n\n### Tunnel description\n\nIn order to meet the predicted traffic capacity, each tunnel required a wide\ncarriageway with a high traffic gauge and wide verges on either side. In\naddition a area had to be left above the traffic gauge to protect overhead\nequipment from loose ropes, tarpaulins and the like. The tunnel was excavated\nusing mechanical diggers rather than a tunnel boring machine (TBM) as the TBM\nwould only have been cheaper if tunnel was longer than . As a result, the\nexcavated part of the tunnel was horse-shoe in shape rather than circular, and\nthe amount of spoil removed was 20% less than would have been the case had a\nTBM been used. Each tunnel has an approximate excavated diameter of . A\nshotcrete primary lining provided the initial support for the tunnel. At the\nsouthern end, where tunneling passed through the Lower Hythe sands, the\nprimary lining was supplemented with \"pins\" to provide more support. Emergency\ninterconnecting cross passages are located at intervals of to facilitate\nmovement of pedestrians between tunnels in case of emergency. Ancillary works\ninclude a deep cutting to the south of the tunnel with a new junction for\nHindhead and Hammer at its southern end. An equestrian and pedestrian bridge,\nthe Miss James Bridge, crosses the cutting between tunnel and junction, and\nincludes heathland planting to link the habitats on either side of the\ncutting.\n\n## Construction and opening\n\nAdvance works started in January 2007, and main construction works, including\nthe tunnelling, started in 2008. Excavation work from the north portal began\non 1 February 2008. Two Liebherr diggers were employed, one on each tunnel\nwith work being carried out around the clock, seven days a week. Work from the\nsouth portal began on 14 May using a single Liebherr digger to dig both\ntunnels. Since the south portal was close to housing, work was restricted to a\nsingle shift five days a week. The poorer ground at the southern end of the\ntunnel also slowed progress. The primary linings were sprayed onto the tunnel\nwith the spraying operation following the excavation operation by about two\nmetres when digging through sandstone and about one metre when digging through\nsand. Breakthrough was achieved on both tunnels on 26 February 2009, 250 m\nfrom the south portal. The extraction rate for the southern portion was 1.2\nm/day and for the northern portion 3.9 m/day. Prior to breakthrough, only the\npart of the tunnel - the semicircular cross-section above the bench - was\nexcavated. Excavation of the bench in the southbound tunnel began on 9 July\n2008. This work progressed much quicker than the initial excavation work as\nseveral faces could be opened up at once. Again, the primary linings were\nsprayed onto the workings as digging progressed. The excavation and primary\nlinings were completed on 31 March 2009 with a total of 737,000 cubic metres\nof spoil having been excavated. The application of the waterproof membrane and\nthe installation of the secondary lining only started once all the excavation\nand primary lining were complete. The waterproof membrane was sprayed onto the\nprimary lining and the pre-cast invert and side section installed. Spraying of\nthe secondary lining onto the crown of the tunnel was scheduled as part of the\nfinalisation of the excavation works. On Sunday, 14 May 2011, one and a half\nmonths before the tunnel was due to open the contractors staged an open day\nwhen 7,000 pedestrians were able to walk the full length of the tunnel while\nlocal music groups performed at the north end of the tunnel. These included\nthe Haslemere Town Band, who performed the \"Devil's Punch Bowl March\" as the\nfirst VIPs emerged from the tunnel. This had been composed especially for the\noccasion by 16-year-old Band member, Eric Foster. The opening ceremony itself,\nto which the public was not invited for safety reasons, was performed by the\nSecretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond on 29 July 2011.\n\n## Safety\n\nFatal fires in the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1999 and\n2001 respectively, resulting in the temporary closures of these tunnels, led\nto a re-evaluation of road tunnel safety throughout Europe. An EU directive\npassed in 2004 laid down the minimum safety requirements for road tunnels\nwithin the EU and EFTA that exceed 500 m in length and that are part of the\nTrans-European Road Network (TEN). Although the Hindhead tunnel is more than\n500 m in length, it does not carry part of the TEN road network so legally\ndoes not need to comply with the directive. The tunnel approaches have cross-\nover systems that enable the police to direct all traffic through one of the\ntunnels should the other be closed as a result of an incident or for\nmaintenance. Due to part of the original A3 having been returned to nature, it\nis not possible to use the old road in an emergency. However the South East of\nEngland has a comprehensive road network, and redirection of traffic from the\nA3 to the M3 would increase the Kingston to Portsmouth journey from to .\nCross-connection tunnels have been constructed at 100 metre intervals to allow\nfor emergency evacuation to the other tunnel should there be an incident.\nAlthough the EU directive requires laybys at intervals not exceeding 1000\nmetres for TEN-T tunnels that do not have emergency lanes, the Hindhead tunnel\ndoes not have any laybys, but it does have 1.2 m verges on either side of the\ncarriageway. The tunnel has two power supplies, one via the north portal and\nthe other via the south portal, each backing the other up in the event of\nfailure. Ventilation is provided by fans mounted above the traffic, though in\nnormal circumstances they will not be operational. Electronic equipment\nincludes linear heat detectors, radar coverage and 104 CCTV cameras that can\npinpoint incidents, intelligent lighting and LED cat's eyes and comprehensive\nfire-fighting systems.\n\n### \"Time trial\" controversy\n\nAccording to reports in September 2011, the tunnel was being used by \"wealthy\nyoung drivers\" in powerful sportscars to perform time trials. They state that\ncars such as Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Aston Martins are regularly seen using\nthe tunnel as a racetrack at night. The average speed of vehicles travelling\nthrough the tunnels is now monitored by SPECS speed cameras.\n\n## Environmental considerations\n\nFrom the outset a tunnel was built rather than a cutting being dug to avoid\nspoiling an area of outstanding natural beauty and a Site of Special\nScientific Interest, much of which is owned by the National Trust. Before\ndigging started an environmental survey was carried out. Common lizards,\nadders and slow-worms found at Boundless Valley were relocated to National\nTrust land at Highcombe Edge while grass snakes were taken to Hurthill Copse.\nTree felling was scheduled to minimise disruption to nesting birds and to\nother wild-life and in certain instances, animals such as dormice were removed\nto similar habitats elsewhere. After the works were completed, 200,000 trees\nwere planted on the route of the old road. The restoration of the old road to\nnature removed a barrier that prevented the migration of ground-nesting birds,\nsuch as woodlarks and nightjars from one part of the nature reserve to the\nother. Among the artefacts found was an old milestone that was discarded\nduring the rebuilding of the road in 1826. The 1811 Ordnance Survey map was\nused to identify the original position of the stone where it has since been\nre-erected. The pre-1826 road is now a pedestrian way to Gibbet Hill. Other\nartefacts of archaeological interest included two lime kilns found near the\nThursley side of the works dating from the 18th or 19th centuries. It is\nprobable that lime produced by the kilns used limestone or chalk from\nPetersfield away and would have been used to counteract the acid nature of the\nsoil. A tree carved with the image of a naked lady in its bark in 1943 was\npreserved with a small adjustment to the tunnel access boundary. The main\ncontractors received the Preservation Award at the 2011 Tunnels and Tunnelling\nAwards ceremony.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of tunnels in the United Kingdom\n  * Devil's Punch Bowl\n  * Hindhead\n  * Gibbet Hill, Hindhead\n  * A3 road\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Highways Agency project information\n  * The News (Portsmouth) \u2013 virtual experience of driving through the Hindhead Tunnel\n\n"

      "# College Football Playoff National Championship\n\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship is a post-season college\nfootball bowl game, used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division\nI Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which began play in the 2014 college\nfootball season. The game serves as the final of the College Football Playoff,\na bracket tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined\nby a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the Bowl\nChampionship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game. Unlike the\nBCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff\nNational Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls, hosted by two of\nthe consortium's six member bowls yearly, and the top two teams as determined\nby the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of\nother bowls. This has caused a unique side effect in that no #1 or #3 seed had\nwon the National Championship in its first five years, with LSU becoming the\nfirst #1 seed to win the championship in 2019. The game is played at a neutral\nsite, determined through bids by prospective host cities (similar to the Super\nBowl and NCAA Final Four). When announcing it was soliciting bids for the 2016\nand 2017 title games, playoff organizers noted that the bids must propose host\nstadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators, and cities cannot host\nboth a semi-final game and the title game in the same year. The winner of the\ngame is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the \"crystal football\",\nwhich has been given by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) since\n1986; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS\nchampionship system. The inaugural game was held at AT&T; Stadium in\nArlington, Texas in January 2015, and was won by Ohio State. The awarded\ntrophy, College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy, is sponsored by\nDr Pepper.\n\n## Venues\n\nThe number of cities capable of bidding for the event is restricted by the\n65,000-seat stadium minimum. In addition to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa,\nwhich was the other finalist for the 2015 matchup, the stadium restriction\nwould limit the bidding to cities such as New Orleans, Glendale, and Pasadena.\nOther possible future hosts include Orlando, San Antonio, and almost any city\nwith a National Football League franchise, since all but three of the stadiums\nin that league (only one, the Chicago Bears' Soldier Field, will fall short\nbeginning with the 2020 season) meet the capacity requirements and, unlike the\nSuper Bowl, there is no de jure restriction on climate. Officials in New York\nCity said they would like to host the game at Yankee Stadium, which hosts the\nannual Pinstripe Bowl, but it falls short of the attendance limit as it only\nholds approximately 54,000 fans in its football configuration (a game could\nstill be hosted in the New York metropolitan area, but it would have to be at\nMetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey). On December 16, 2013, host\nselections for the 2016 and 2017 title games were announced. Glendale, Arizona\n(University of Phoenix Stadium) was selected to host the 2016 game and Tampa,\nFlorida (Raymond James Stadium) was selected to host the 2017 game. Four\ncities had submitted bids for the 2016 game: Glendale, Jacksonville (EverBank\nField), New Orleans (Mercedes-Benz Superdome), and Tampa. Six metropolitan\nareas had been vying for the 2017 game: Tampa, the San Francisco Bay Area\n(Levi's Stadium), Minneapolis (U.S. Bank Stadium), San Antonio (Alamodome),\nSouth Florida (Hard Rock Stadium), and Jacksonville (Jacksonville Municipal\nStadium).

      "# 60th parallel north\n\nThe 60th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 60 degrees north of\nEarth's equator. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America,\nand the Atlantic Ocean. Although it lies approximately twice as far away from\nthe Equator as from the North Pole, the 60th parallel is half as long as the\nEquator line. This is where the Earth bulges halfway as much as on the\nEquator. At this latitude, the Sun is visible for 18 hours, 52 minutes during\nthe June solstice and 5 hours, 52 minutes during the December solstice. The\nmaximum altitude of the Sun is 53.44\u00b0 on 21 June and 6.56\u00b0 on 21 December.

He also performed on stage, film, television and\nradio, taking over from Peter Jones as \"The Book\" (the narrator) in the third,\nfourth and fifth radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He is\nalso known for his portrayal of Sexton Blake for BBC Radio 4 in 1967.\n\n## Early life\n\nFranklyn was born in Kensington into an acting family: his maternal\ngrandfather, Arthur Rigby, Sr and uncle, Arthur Rigby, Jr, mother, Mary Rigby,\nand father, Leo Franklyn, were all actors. He was taken to Australia as a\nbaby, where his father toured with musical comedies. The young Franklyn\nattended Wesley and Haileybury Colleges, both in Melbourne and developed an\nabiding love of cricket. He later trialled as a fast bowler for Essex, and\nopened the bowling for the Stage Cricket Club. He also became a leg spinner,\nand ran his own team, the Sargentmen, raising money for the Malcolm Sargent\nCancer Fund for Children. He returned to London, aged 11. He was evacuated to\nLuscombe Castle in Devon in the Second World War. His stage career began at\nthe age of 18, when he appeared in My Sister Eileen at the Savoy Theatre in\n1943. He was called up to join the Parachute Regiment, and was sent to\nPalestine.\n\n## Career\n\nHe appeared in Arsenic and Old Lace at Southsea Pier in 1946, soon after he\nwas demobilised, and settled on an acting career. He continued to tour with\nthe play in repertory for six years. In a slow period, he traded as an\nantiques dealer, taking junk away on a barrow from rich areas of London and\nselling it as antiques. He went on to perform on the stage, on television and\nradio, and in several films. He appeared in several films in the 1950s,\nincluding Quatermass 2 in 1957, and took a starring role in the 1961 film Pit\nof Darkness which was the B-feature shown with Adam Faith's What A Whopper. He\nfeatured in the 1965 Morecambe and Wise film The Intelligence Men. He appeared\nin London's West End in comedies such as There's A Girl in My Soup and Tunnel\nof Love. After perfunctory Italian lessons, he directed a version of There's A\nGirl in My Soup in Italy, with Italian actors, in Italian. On television, he\nwas a panellist on game shows such as What's My Line? and Call My Bluff. He\nplayed Jacques Fleury in The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel (1955\u201356) and\nPeter Dallas in the spy drama series Top Secret (1961\u201362), and also appeared\nin several episodes of The Avengers. He was featured on This Is Your Life\n(1978), appeared in the 1984 comedy television series The Steam Video Company,\nand in G.B.H. (1991) and Diana: Her True Story (1993). He was also known for\ncommercial voice-over work; he appeared on screen in 10 commercials and voiced\nanother 40 from 1965 to 1973. The \"Schhh... You Know Who\" Schweppes adverts\nFranklyn voiced were created by Ogilvy and Mather. He voiced Danger Mouse in\nthe unbroadcast pilot for the British television series (although David Jason\nreplaced him in all broadcast episodes). On radio, he was the reader of the\nquotes on BBC Radio 4's Quote Unquote for 11 years, until shortly before his\ndeath, and also read for The News Quiz. In 2004 and 2005 he took over the role\nof \"The Book\" (the narrator) from his friend Peter Jones for the third, fourth\nand fifth radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\n## Filmography\n\n## Personal life\n\nFranklyn was married twice: first to Margo Johns in 1952; they had a daughter,\nactress Sabina Franklyn, but were divorced in 1962. He remarried in 1969; he\nand his second wife, Susanna, had two daughters, Francesca Franklyn, a film\nproducer, and Melissa Franklyn, an actress.

      "# Hindhead Tunnel\n\nThe Hindhead Tunnel, opened in 2011, is part of the dual-carriageway Hindhead\nbypass that replaced one of the last remaining stretches of single-carriageway\non the A3, the London to Portsmouth road. The bypass was constructed to\nimprove road safety, reduce congestion and improve air quality. At in length,\nthe tunnel is the longest non-estuarial road tunnel in the United Kingdom, and\ntakes the road beneath the Devil's Punch Bowl, a Site of Special Scientific\nInterest.\n\n## History\n\nA naval dockyard has existed in Portsmouth since at least Tudor times, giving\nsignificant importance to the road linking that city with London. The original\nroute skirted the north-western limits of The Weald climbing to the summit of\nGibbet Hill close to Hindhead. In 1826 the road was rebuilt around the Devil's\nPunch Bowl to ensure that the gradient was no more than 5%. The road became\npart of the A3 when road numbering was introduced in the 1920s. By the start\nof the new millennium most of the A3 had been dualled; of the route from\nSouthfields to Havant, only the section that passed through Hindhead and the\nDevil's Punch Bowl was still single carriageway. This section, which passed\nthrough an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), operated at or above\ncapacity for much of the day and had an accident rate 40% higher than the\nnational average for that class of road.\n\n## Design\n\nBy 2000 the A3 between Southfields and Havant had been built to dual\ncarriageway standards for its entire length apart from the Hindhead section\n(there are still sections of single carriageway within London and Portsmouth).\nThe termini of the northern and southern sections of dual carriageway were at\naltitudes of and above sea level respectively and the single carriageway\nlinking them followed a winding route around the Devil's Punch Bowl, reaching\nan altitude of . The Hindhead Tunnel project shortened the route by about and\nrouted the road through a tunnel whose northern and southern portals are at\naltitudes of and above sea level respectively.\n\n### Assessment of proposals\n\nThe need for improvements to the A3 through Hindhead had been recognised for\nmany years with a route study being undertaken between 1970 and 1976. In 1983\nsome nine alternatives for the A3 were investigated by the Department for\nTransport, but assessment showed that only one which went around the north and\nwest side of the Punch Bowl (the \"Red Route\"), crossing the Smallbrook Valley\nwas viable. A public consultation on the route met with opposition and two\nalternatives were suggested both of which drew less support than the proposed\nroute which in 1988 became the preferred route. Subsequent environmental\nsurveys showed that this route would have substantial adverse impacts\nresulting in the proposal to adapt an earlier scheme by including a tunnel to\navoid the most sensitive parts of the route. The scheme entered the\nGovernment\u2019s targeted programme of improvements in 2001. A public inquiry was\nheld in September 2004 to hear objections and to consider alternatives to the\nproposal. Among the alternative proposals was one for a surface route\nfollowing a more westerly line that would avoid building a tunnel (an\nadaptation of the \"Red Route\"). Despite being significantly more expensive\nthan building a surface road, a tunnel was preferred after two alternative\nsurface schemes were rejected on environmental grounds. The decision to put\npart of the road in a tunnel pushed the cost of the project to \u00a3371 million,\nwith the underground section costing \u00a3155,000 per metre (\u00a3142,000 per yard)\nmaking that section of road the second most expensive road in the UK per unit\ndistance, after the Limehouse Link tunnel.\n\n### Geology\n\nThe Hindhead tunnel runs through a sequence of fine grained strata of the\nLower Greensand Group that were laid over Wealden Clay during (part of the\nWealden Group) during the Lower Cretaceous period (70140 million years ago) on\nthe margins of the subsiding Weald Basin. The Greensand group consists of the\nHythe Beds, which overlay a layer of Atherfield Clay. The Hythe beds\nthemselves, which host the tunnel, consist of the Upper Hythe bed, which has a\nfour substrata identified by the letters \"A\" to \"D\", and the Lower Hythe bed,\nwhich has two strata which are identified by the letters \"A\" and \"B\".\nOriginally that whole area was covered by the Burgate Beds, but when the Weald\nwas uplifted, the Burgate Beds were eroded away. Most of the tunnel passes\nthrough the Upper Hythe C and D layers and the Lower Hythe A layer which are\ndescribed as \"Weak, locally very weak to moderately strong, slightly clayey\nfine to medium sandstone with occasional thin beds of clayey/silty fine sand\"\nand typically has Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) values of 2\u20135 MPa. The\nrock is heavily fractured and has mean fracture centres varying from . The\nsouthern end of the tunnel however passes through the \"less competent\" Upper\nHythe A and B layers which are described as \"medium dense thinly bedded and\nthinly laminated, clean to silty and clayey fine and medium sand with\nsubordinate weak to strong sandstone, cherty sandstone and chert\". Most of the\ntunnel is above the predicted water table.\n\n### Access and the old A3 road\n\nAccess to the new section of road from the north is via the original A3 with\naccess to the old A3 being provided from the Thursley Junction, completed in\n2005, about one kilometre beyond the northern limit of the Hindhead Tunnel\nworks. The new road can be accessed from the south using the original A3 with\nnew access points being provided by new junctions at Hazel Grove. After the\nconstruction was completed, the section of the old A3 from the A287\nintersection in Hindhead southwards was renamed the A333, the section from the\nintersection northwards up to the National Trust car park has been retained,\nand the section that follows the Devil's Punch Bowl contour has been returned\nto nature. The remainder of the old A3 was either converted to a cycle\ntrack/bridlepath or is being used as a local road.\n\n### Tunnel description\n\nIn order to meet the predicted traffic capacity, each tunnel required a wide\ncarriageway with a high traffic gauge and wide verges on either side. In\naddition a area had to be left above the traffic gauge to protect overhead\nequipment from loose ropes, tarpaulins and the like. The tunnel was excavated\nusing mechanical diggers rather than a tunnel boring machine (TBM) as the TBM\nwould only have been cheaper if tunnel was longer than . As a result, the\nexcavated part of the tunnel was horse-shoe in shape rather than circular, and\nthe amount of spoil removed was 20% less than would have been the case had a\nTBM been used. Each tunnel has an approximate excavated diameter of . A\nshotcrete primary lining provided the initial support for the tunnel. At the\nsouthern end, where tunneling passed through the Lower Hythe sands, the\nprimary lining was supplemented with \"pins\" to provide more support. Emergency\ninterconnecting cross passages are located at intervals of to facilitate\nmovement of pedestrians between tunnels in case of emergency. Ancillary works\ninclude a deep cutting to the south of the tunnel with a new junction for\nHindhead and Hammer at its southern end. An equestrian and pedestrian bridge,\nthe Miss James Bridge, crosses the cutting between tunnel and junction, and\nincludes heathland planting to link the habitats on either side of the\ncutting.\n\n## Construction and opening\n\nAdvance works started in January 2007, and main construction works, including\nthe tunnelling, started in 2008. Excavation work from the north portal began\non 1 February 2008. Two Liebherr diggers were employed, one on each tunnel\nwith work being carried out around the clock, seven days a week. Work from the\nsouth portal began on 14 May using a single Liebherr digger to dig both\ntunnels. Since the south portal was close to housing, work was restricted to a\nsingle shift five days a week. The poorer ground at the southern end of the\ntunnel also slowed progress. The primary linings were sprayed onto the tunnel\nwith the spraying operation following the excavation operation by about two\nmetres when digging through sandstone and about one metre when digging through\nsand. Breakthrough was achieved on both tunnels on 26 February 2009, 250 m\nfrom the south portal. The extraction rate for the southern portion was 1.2\nm/day and for the northern portion 3.9 m/day. Prior to breakthrough, only the\npart of the tunnel - the semicircular cross-section above the bench - was\nexcavated. Excavation of the bench in the southbound tunnel began on 9 July\n2008. This work progressed much quicker than the initial excavation work as\nseveral faces could be opened up at once. Again, the primary linings were\nsprayed onto the workings as digging progressed. The excavation and primary\nlinings were completed on 31 March 2009 with a total of 737,000 cubic metres\nof spoil having been excavated. The application of the waterproof membrane and\nthe installation of the secondary lining only started once all the excavation\nand primary lining were complete. The waterproof membrane was sprayed onto the\nprimary lining and the pre-cast invert and side section installed. Spraying of\nthe secondary lining onto the crown of the tunnel was scheduled as part of the\nfinalisation of the excavation works. On Sunday, 14 May 2011, one and a half\nmonths before the tunnel was due to open the contractors staged an open day\nwhen 7,000 pedestrians were able to walk the full length of the tunnel while\nlocal music groups performed at the north end of the tunnel. These included\nthe Haslemere Town Band, who performed the \"Devil's Punch Bowl March\" as the\nfirst VIPs emerged from the tunnel. This had been composed especially for the\noccasion by 16-year-old Band member, Eric Foster. The opening ceremony itself,\nto which the public was not invited for safety reasons, was performed by the\nSecretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond on 29 July 2011.\n\n## Safety\n\nFatal fires in the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1999 and\n2001 respectively, resulting in the temporary closures of these tunnels, led\nto a re-evaluation of road tunnel safety throughout Europe. An EU directive\npassed in 2004 laid down the minimum safety requirements for road tunnels\nwithin the EU and EFTA that exceed 500 m in length and that are part of the\nTrans-European Road Network (TEN). Although the Hindhead tunnel is more than\n500 m in length, it does not carry part of the TEN road network so legally\ndoes not need to comply with the directive. The tunnel approaches have cross-\nover systems that enable the police to direct all traffic through one of the\ntunnels should the other be closed as a result of an incident or for\nmaintenance. Due to part of the original A3 having been returned to nature, it\nis not possible to use the old road in an emergency. However the South East of\nEngland has a comprehensive road network, and redirection of traffic from the\nA3 to the M3 would increase the Kingston to Portsmouth journey from to .\nCross-connection tunnels have been constructed at 100 metre intervals to allow\nfor emergency evacuation to the other tunnel should there be an incident.\nAlthough the EU directive requires laybys at intervals not exceeding 1000\nmetres for TEN-T tunnels that do not have emergency lanes, the Hindhead tunnel\ndoes not have any laybys, but it does have 1.2 m verges on either side of the\ncarriageway. The tunnel has two power supplies, one via the north portal and\nthe other via the south portal, each backing the other up in the event of\nfailure. Ventilation is provided by fans mounted above the traffic, though in\nnormal circumstances they will not be operational. Electronic equipment\nincludes linear heat detectors, radar coverage and 104 CCTV cameras that can\npinpoint incidents, intelligent lighting and LED cat's eyes and comprehensive\nfire-fighting systems.\n\n### \"Time trial\" controversy\n\nAccording to reports in September 2011, the tunnel was being used by \"wealthy\nyoung drivers\" in powerful sportscars to perform time trials. They state that\ncars such as Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Aston Martins are regularly seen using\nthe tunnel as a racetrack at night. The average speed of vehicles travelling\nthrough the tunnels is now monitored by SPECS speed cameras.\n\n## Environmental considerations\n\nFrom the outset a tunnel was built rather than a cutting being dug to avoid\nspoiling an area of outstanding natural beauty and a Site of Special\nScientific Interest, much of which is owned by the National Trust. Before\ndigging started an environmental survey was carried out. Common lizards,\nadders and slow-worms found at Boundless Valley were relocated to National\nTrust land at Highcombe Edge while grass snakes were taken to Hurthill Copse.\nTree felling was scheduled to minimise disruption to nesting birds and to\nother wild-life and in certain instances, animals such as dormice were removed\nto similar habitats elsewhere. After the works were completed, 200,000 trees\nwere planted on the route of the old road. The restoration of the old road to\nnature removed a barrier that prevented the migration of ground-nesting birds,\nsuch as woodlarks and nightjars from one part of the nature reserve to the\nother. Among the artefacts found was an old milestone that was discarded\nduring the rebuilding of the road in 1826. The 1811 Ordnance Survey map was\nused to identify the original position of the stone where it has since been\nre-erected. The pre-1826 road is now a pedestrian way to Gibbet Hill. Other\nartefacts of archaeological interest included two lime kilns found near the\nThursley side of the works dating from the 18th or 19th centuries. It is\nprobable that lime produced by the kilns used limestone or chalk from\nPetersfield away and would have been used to counteract the acid nature of the\nsoil. A tree carved with the image of a naked lady in its bark in 1943 was\npreserved with a small adjustment to the tunnel access boundary. The main\ncontractors received the Preservation Award at the 2011 Tunnels and Tunnelling\nAwards ceremony.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of tunnels in the United Kingdom\n  * Devil's Punch Bowl\n  * Hindhead\n  * Gibbet Hill, Hindhead\n  * A3 road\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Highways Agency project information\n  * The News (Portsmouth) \u2013 virtual experience of driving through the Hindhead Tunnel\n\n"

      "# I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998 film)\n\nI'll Be Home for Christmas is a 1998 American Christmas family comedy film\ndirected by Arlene Sanford. The plot follows a college student who must make\nit from his campus in Los Angeles, California to his family's home in\nLarchmont, New York in time for Christmas dinner in order to win his father's\nPorsche. It stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jessica Biel, Adam LaVorgna, Sean\nO'Bryan and Gary Cole and was released on November 13, 1998.\n\n## Plot\n\nJake Wilkinson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an 18-year-old attending the\n(fictional) Palisades College in California, has not been home to Larchmont,\nNew York for any holidays since his mother died and his father remarried 10\nmonths later. A few days before Christmas Eve, his father offers to give him\nhis vintage 1957 Porsche 356 if he is home by 6:00 PM Christmas Eve for\nChristmas dinner. Initially, Jake had traded in his airline ticket to New York\nCity for two tickets to Cabo San Lucas to take his girlfriend Allie Henderson\n(Jessica Biel), who is also from New York. When she declines, Jake reconsiders\nhis father's deal and retrades the tickets back to New York. Allie agrees to\nride with him. With his trio of goons, Eddie Taffet (Adam LaVorgna), Jake's\nnemesis and rival for Allie's affections, leaves Jake in the desert dressed as\nSanta Claus to punish him for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal they had\nthat Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the\nCalifornia desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York\nafter she thinks Jake bailed on her again. Jake has only three days to get to\nLarchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan (Andrew Lauer), a\nsimple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New\nYork. A police officer named Max (Sean O'Bryan) pulls them over in Red Cliff,\nColorado for speeding, so Jake lies that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and\nthey're donating the goods to the children's hospital. The officer invites\nthem to accompany him to North Platte, Nebraska to help him win back his wife\nMarjorie (Lesley Boone). Meanwhile, Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at\na novelty hotel in a Bavarian village, the Amana Colonies in Amana, Iowa. They\nare unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting\nlive. Jake sees them kiss while he's waiting at the bus station in Nebraska\nand develops a scheme to convince the bus driver to drop him off at the\nBavarian village. He obtains a cooler and a slab of meat, writes Allie's name\nand address on the cooler, and convinces the whole busload that the cooler\nneeds to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village\nfor a transplant. After Allie lets Jake into her and Eddie's room, Eddie walks\nout of the shower only clad in a towel and Jake assumes he and Allie have\nslept together. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie\nprevented him from getting home by 6 PM. Upset that Jake cares more about the\ncar than about her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat. Jake and\nEddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will get\nAllie and the Porsche if he makes it home, and throws Jake out of his car\nsomewhere in Wisconsin. Jake decides to enter a Santa Claus race for a chance\nto win the $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is\narrested after insulting (and possibly doing more) two policemen dressed as\nChristmas trees patrolling the race. While registering for the race, Jake\nmeets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, whom he barely beats in the race. But en\nroute to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the\nmayor of the town; he usually wins the race every year and uses the prize\nmoney to buy food for the impoverished. Jake feels bad and gives the money to\nthe Mayor. Jake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for\nhim from Madison, Wisconsin. The airline doesn't let him board because he has\nno photographic identification, so he stows away in a dog kennel on a cargo\naircraft with a large dog named Ringo. From the airport he hides on a train,\ntries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the\nlocal parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make\nup. Jake rides the sleigh home, arrives at 5:59 PM, and intentionally waits a\nfew minutes to go inside so he isn't in time to get the Porsche. When his\nfather offers it to him anyway, he refuses. He also finally accepts his\nstepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get into the sleigh just as the parade\narrives and join the procession.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Jonathan Taylor Thomas as Jake Wilkinson\n  * Jessica Biel as Allie Henderson\n  * Adam LaVorgna as Eddie Taffet\n  * Sean O'Bryan as Officer Max\n  * Gary Cole as Mr. Wilkinson\n  * Eve Gordon as Carolyn Wilkinson\n  * Lauren Maltby as Tracey Wilkinson\n  * Andrew Lauer as Nolan\n  * Lesley Boone as Marjorie\n\n## Release\n\n### Box office\n\nI'll Be Home for Christmas made $3.9 million in its opening weekend, finishing\nat 6th at the box office. At the end of its run, the film grossed $12 million,\nagainst its $30 million budget, making it a box office bomb.\n\n### Critical reception\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23%\nbased on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10.

      "# I'll Be Home for Christmas\n\n## Theme\n\nThe song is sung from the point of view of a soldier stationed overseas during\nWorld War II, writing a letter to his family. In the message, he tells the\nfamily he will be coming home and to prepare the holiday for him, and requests\nsnow, mistletoe, and presents on the tree. The song ends on a melancholy note,\nwith the soldier saying, \"I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams\".\nThe flip side of the original recording (Decca 18570B) was \"Danny Boy\"\n\n## Writing and copyright\n\nThe song was written by the lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent.\nSongwriter and later producer and manager for The Platters, Buck Ram, who said\nhe previously wrote a poem and song with the same title, was credited as a co-\nwriter of the song following a lawsuit brought by Ram's publisher, Mills\nMusic. Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed\nonly Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later\npressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit.\n\n## Bing Crosby recording\n\nOn October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for\nChristmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for\nDecca Records; it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix\n#L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the\nsong charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the\nsong reached number 16 on the charts. The U.S. War Department also released\nBing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7,\n1944, Kraft Music Hall broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc,\nas U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix\n#VP1253-D5TC206. The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby\ncompilations. The song touched the hearts of Americans, soldiers and civilians\nalike, in the midst of World War II, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold\nrecord. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at\nChristmas U.S.O. shows. The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more\nfor military morale than anyone else of that era\". Despite the song's\npopularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned\nthe song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might\nlower morale among British troops.\n\n### Charts\n\n## Notable history and cover versions\n\nIn December 1965, astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, while on Gemini 7,\nrequested \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" be played for them by the NASA ground\ncrew.

      "# I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998 film)\n\nI'll Be Home for Christmas is a 1998 American Christmas family comedy film\ndirected by Arlene Sanford. The plot follows a college student who must make\nit from his campus in Los Angeles, California to his family's home in\nLarchmont, New York in time for Christmas dinner in order to win his father's\nPorsche. It stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jessica Biel, Adam LaVorgna, Sean\nO'Bryan and Gary Cole and was released on November 13, 1998.\n\n## Plot\n\nJake Wilkinson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an 18-year-old attending the\n(fictional) Palisades College in California, has not been home to Larchmont,\nNew York for any holidays since his mother died and his father remarried 10\nmonths later. A few days before Christmas Eve, his father offers to give him\nhis vintage 1957 Porsche 356 if he is home by 6:00 PM Christmas Eve for\nChristmas dinner. Initially, Jake had traded in his airline ticket to New York\nCity for two tickets to Cabo San Lucas to take his girlfriend Allie Henderson\n(Jessica Biel), who is also from New York. When she declines, Jake reconsiders\nhis father's deal and retrades the tickets back to New York. Allie agrees to\nride with him. With his trio of goons, Eddie Taffet (Adam LaVorgna), Jake's\nnemesis and rival for Allie's affections, leaves Jake in the desert dressed as\nSanta Claus to punish him for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal they had\nthat Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the\nCalifornia desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York\nafter she thinks Jake bailed on her again. Jake has only three days to get to\nLarchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan (Andrew Lauer), a\nsimple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New\nYork. A police officer named Max (Sean O'Bryan) pulls them over in Red Cliff,\nColorado for speeding, so Jake lies that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and\nthey're donating the goods to the children's hospital. The officer invites\nthem to accompany him to North Platte, Nebraska to help him win back his wife\nMarjorie (Lesley Boone). Meanwhile, Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at\na novelty hotel in a Bavarian village, the Amana Colonies in Amana, Iowa. They\nare unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting\nlive. Jake sees them kiss while he's waiting at the bus station in Nebraska\nand develops a scheme to convince the bus driver to drop him off at the\nBavarian village. He obtains a cooler and a slab of meat, writes Allie's name\nand address on the cooler, and convinces the whole busload that the cooler\nneeds to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village\nfor a transplant. After Allie lets Jake into her and Eddie's room, Eddie walks\nout of the shower only clad in a towel and Jake assumes he and Allie have\nslept together. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie\nprevented him from getting home by 6 PM. Upset that Jake cares more about the\ncar than about her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat. Jake and\nEddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will get\nAllie and the Porsche if he makes it home, and throws Jake out of his car\nsomewhere in Wisconsin. Jake decides to enter a Santa Claus race for a chance\nto win the $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is\narrested after insulting (and possibly doing more) two policemen dressed as\nChristmas trees patrolling the race. While registering for the race, Jake\nmeets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, whom he barely beats in the race. But en\nroute to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the\nmayor of the town; he usually wins the race every year and uses the prize\nmoney to buy food for the impoverished. Jake feels bad and gives the money to\nthe Mayor. Jake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for\nhim from Madison, Wisconsin. The airline doesn't let him board because he has\nno photographic identification, so he stows away in a dog kennel on a cargo\naircraft with a large dog named Ringo. From the airport he hides on a train,\ntries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the\nlocal parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make\nup. Jake rides the sleigh home, arrives at 5:59 PM, and intentionally waits a\nfew minutes to go inside so he isn't in time to get the Porsche. When his\nfather offers it to him anyway, he refuses. He also finally accepts his\nstepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get into the sleigh just as the parade\narrives and join the procession.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Jonathan Taylor Thomas as Jake Wilkinson\n  * Jessica Biel as Allie Henderson\n  * Adam LaVorgna as Eddie Taffet\n  * Sean O'Bryan as Officer Max\n  * Gary Cole as Mr. Wilkinson\n  * Eve Gordon as Carolyn Wilkinson\n  * Lauren Maltby as Tracey Wilkinson\n  * Andrew Lauer as Nolan\n  * Lesley Boone as Marjorie\n\n## Release\n\n### Box office\n\nI'll Be Home for Christmas made $3.9 million in its opening weekend, finishing\nat 6th at the box office.

The governor appoints the chief\nminister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the\nassembly. Given the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is\nfor five years and is subject to no term limits. Following Madhya Pradesh's\nreorganisation on 1 November 1956, 18 people have served as its chief\nminister. Twelve of these belonged to the Indian National Congress, including\nthe inaugural officeholder Ravishankar Shukla. The first non-Congress chief\nminister was Govind Narayan Singh who defected from the party and lead a\nSamyukta Vidhayak Dal government from 1967 to 1969. Digvijaya Singh of the\nCongress became the first officeholder to serve two full five-year terms. He\nwas succeeded by Uma Bharti of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Madhya Pradesh's\nonly woman chief minister. Shivraj Singh Chouhan of the Bharatiya Janata Party\nhas the longest incumbency of 13 years having held office from November 2005\nto December 2018. The current incumbent is Kamal Nath of the Indian National\nCongress.\n\n## Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh\n\n",

      "# Home Run Derby\n\nThe Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting competition in Major League\nBaseball (MLB) customarily held the day before the MLB All-Star Game, which\nplaces the contest on a Monday in July. Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the\nevent has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based\ncompetition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.\n\n## History\n\nThe event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was not\ntelevised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-inning\nevent with each player receiving five outs per inning, allowing for the\npossibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on\nESPN. In 2000, a \"match play\"-style format was instituted for the second\nround. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player\nwith the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the\nsecond- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to\nthe finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition. The field\nof players selected currently consists of four American League players and\nfour National League players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each\nleague, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each\nleague, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players,\nwith five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the\nNL's four). In 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league\nformat. The only exception was 2005, when Major League Baseball changed the\nselection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries\ninstead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in\npromotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic, played in March 2006. In\n2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the\nformat was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides. Some\nnotable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005, who won the\nDerby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first\nround. The first-round record was broken in 2019 by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who\nhit 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home\nruns in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by\nGiancarlo Stanton, who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating Todd\nFrazier in the final round. The current overall record is held by Vladimir\nGuerrero Jr. at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only two participants, Yoenis\nC\u00e9spedes and Giancarlo Stanton, have won the Home Run Derby without being\nselected to the All-Star Game.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Format\n\n8 players duel in a home run challenge.\n\n#### 1985\u20131990\n\nIn the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players from both the AL and NL\nwere selected to participate. Each player was given 2 \"innings\" to hit as many\nhome runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. For the derby, an out is defined\nas any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player\nwith the most total home runs in the two innings.\n\n#### 1991\u20132005\n\nBeginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991\u20132006,\n8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before\nreaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top\nfour advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final. In\nhonor of the World Baseball Classic, the 2005 contest featured eight players\nfrom different countries. The format remained the same.\n\n#### 2006\u20132013\n\nThe format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each\nround, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with\nthe four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players\nwith the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.\n\n#### 2014\n\nThe Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to\nspeed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five\nplayers from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1,\nwith each players having seven \"outs.\" The player in each league with the\nhighest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the\nsecond- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round\n2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner\ncrowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each\nround stands alone, with the score reset for each round. Ties in any round are\nbroken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players remain tied, the players engage\nin a sudden-death swing-off until one player homers.\n\n#### 2015\u2013Present\n\nThe format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant change was the\nelimination of \"outs\", which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are\nseeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit\nas many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup\nadvances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up,\ntwo sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the\nwinner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is\ndetermined. Further, a player can get \"bonus time\" in the last minute of each\nround. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not\nrestart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time\ncould be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring\nat least are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of\nbonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over . Weather\nconcerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to\nfour minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of\nbonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least . The four-\nminute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time\nwas reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least . The\nadditional time was removed. Each batter is allowed one time-out during each\nround, and two in the finals. For 2017 and 2018, the first tie-breaker was\nincreased from a 1-minute swing off to minutes. However, it was not needed\neither of these years. The swing off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first\nyear in which it was used.\n\n### Gold balls\n\nFrom 2005\u20132013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in\n2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final\nminute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real\nEstate and Major League Baseball would donate $21,000 (a reference to the \"21\"\nin \"Century 21\") per home run to charity (MLB donated to the Boys and Girls\nClubs of America, and Century 21 donated to Easter Seals). In both 2005 and\n2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball\nhome runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated\n$17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the\nBoys and Girls Clubs of America. In the 2007 event, fifteen golden balls were\nhit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the 2008 event.\nFor 2009, State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000\nwas collected. For 2010, the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per\nhome run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since 2014 any homer hit off a\nT-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB,\nto Team Rubicon.\n\n## Television and radio coverage\n\nOn July 11, 1988, the day before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game from\nCincinnati, TBS televised the annual All-Star Gala from the Cincinnati Zoo.\nLarry King hosted the broadcast with Craig Sager and Pete Van Wieren handling\ninterviews. The broadcast's big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which\nTBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in prime time\nduring the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition\nwere canceled due to rain. The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in\n1993 on a same-day delayed basis, with the first live telecast in 1998.\nAlthough two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it\nhas rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to\nfour hours. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on\nESPN, including his catchphrase, \"Back back back\u2026Gone!\". Berman starts this\nphrase when the ball is hit, and does not say \"Gone!\" until the ball lands.\nThe 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic cable program. Because\nof the game's TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to\nparticipate. Notably, Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly declined to take part\nin 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game\nthe night before. After a discussion with ESPN's Joe Morgan and another with\nHall of Famer Frank Robinson, Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby\nat Coors Field. In Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network\nESPN Deportes. ESPN Radio also carries the event annually.\n\n### Most watched Home Run Derbys\n\n## Winners\n\n## Records\n\n### Most home runs in a single round\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs\n\n### Most single-derby home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Most all-time home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Wins by team\n\n## Complete scoreboard\n\n### 1980s\n\n#### 1985\n\n#### 1986\n\n#### 1987\n\n#### 1988\n\nHome Run Derby canceled due to rain.\n\n#### 1989\n\n### 1990s\n\n#### 1990\n\n#### 1991\n\n#### 1992\n\n#### 1993\n\n* Lost in playoff to Gonzalez \n\n#### 1994\n\n#### 1995\n\n* Beat Belle in finals \n\n#### 1996\n\n#### 1997\n\n* Beat Walker in finals \n\n#### 1998\n\n#### 1999\n\n* Lost to Burnitz in round 2 \n\n### 2000s\n\n#### 2000\n\n#### 2001\n\n#### 2002\n\n* Giambi defeated Konerko in a swing off \n\n#### 2003\n\n#### 2004\n\n#### 2005\n\n#### 2006\n\n#### 2007\n\n#### 2008\n\n#### 2009\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010\n\n#### 2011\n\n#### 2012\n\n#### 2013\n\n#### 2014\n\n  * designates bye round.  \n\n(designates swing off home runs).\n\n#### 2015 Great American Ball Park (Cincinnati)\n\n#### 2016 Petco Park (San Diego)\n\n#### 2017 Marlins Park (Miami)\n\n#### 2018 Nationals Park (Washington)\n\n#### 2019 Progressive Field (Cleveland)\n\n* Round went into three swing-offs after Guerrero Jr. and Pederson were tied with 29 home runs each. \n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Major League Baseball All-Star Games\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * MLB.com: Home Run Derby History\n  * Baseball-Almanac.com: Home Run Derby Results and Analysis\n  * Baseball Research Journal, SABR, \"Home Run Derby Curse, Fact or Fiction?\" by Joseph McCollum and Marcus Jaiclin\n\n"

      "# 2017 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby\n\nThe 2017 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby was a home run hitting contest\nbetween eight batters from Major League Baseball (MLB). The derby was held on\nJuly 10, 2017, at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida, the site of the 2017 MLB\nAll-Star Game. On July 5, the participants were announced. Aaron Judge won,\nbecoming the first rookie to win the event outright.\n\n## Rules\n\nEight players participated in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination\ntimed event. Each player had four minutes to hit as many home runs as\npossible. Hitters were awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home\nruns over . Hitters were also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock\n(two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute\nresulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile & MLB, to the Boys &\nGirls Clubs of America. The eight competing players were seeded 1-8 based on\ntheir home run totals. The higher seed hit second in any round, and the round\nended if the higher seed surpassed the total of the first hitter. In the event\nof a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off\n(with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player got three\nswings; whoever hit more home runs in the three swings would be declared the\nwinner; thereafter, sudden death swings would occur until the tie was broken.\n\n## Results\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\n\nIn baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter\nis able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any\nrunners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An\nautomatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the\noutfield fence in fair territory. More rarely, an inside-the-park home run\noccurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play\non the field. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the\nhome run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year. Only home\nruns hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead.\nMark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other\nplayer that year. However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL)\nOakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway\nthrough the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24,\nrespectively) did not qualify to lead either league. The first home run\nchampion in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural\n1876 season, Hall hit five home runs for the short-lived National League\nPhiladelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall\nof Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 home runs for the American\nLeague Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 22-season career, Babe\nRuth led the American League in home runs 12 times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph\nKiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt\nwith eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven\nconsecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run\ntitles by any player. Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season home\nrun record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and\nfinally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are tied for the widest margin\nof victory for a home run champion as he topped the next highest total by 35\nhome runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years\nuntil Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years\nlater by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record\nchase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also\nhas the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in\n2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs \u2013\nGreg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez,\nLuis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs\n42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major\nleague was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in\n1878.\n\n## Key\n\n## American League\n\n## National League\n\n## Other major leagues\n\n## See also\n\n  * Babe Ruth Home Run Award (discontinued) \u2013 awarded to the MLB home-run leader\n  * Josh Gibson Legacy Award \u2013 awarded to the AL and NL home-run leaders\n  * Mel Ott Award \u2013 awarded to the NL home-run leader\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * Recognized \"major leagues\" include the current American and National Leagues and several defunct leagues \u2013 the American Association, the Federal League, the Players' League, and the Union Association.\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# Run batted in\n\nA run batted in (RBI), plural runs batted in (RBI or RBIs), is a statistic in\nbaseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a\nrun to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made\non the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit, then another player\non a higher base can head home to score a run, and the batter gets credited\nwith batting in that run. Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs\nbatted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI\nstatistic was tabulated\u2014unofficially\u2014from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer\nErnie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. Common\nnicknames for an RBI include \"ribby\" (or \"ribbie\"), \"rib\", and \"ribeye\". The\nplural of RBI is generally \"RBIs\", although some commentators use \"RBI\" as\nboth singular and plural, as it can also stand for \"runs batted in\".\n\n## Major League Baseball Rules\n\nThe 2018 edition of the Official Baseball Rules of Major League Baseball\n(MLB), Rule 9.04 Runs Batted In, reads: From 1980 to 1988, the game-winning\nRBI was an additional statistic used in MLB.\n\n## Criticism\n\nThe perceived significance of the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one\nof the three categories that compose the triple crown. In addition, career\nRBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of\nFame. However, critics, particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue\nthat RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player\nhimself. This is because an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or\nmore batters preceding him in the batting order have reached base (the\nexception to this being a home run, in which the batter is credited with\ndriving himself in, not just those already on base). This implies that better\noffensive teams \u2014and therefore, the teams in which the most players get on\nbase\u2014 tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals than equivalent hitters\non lesser-hitting teams.\n\n## RBI leaders in Major League Baseball\n\n### Career\n\nTotals are current through July 29, 2019.

      "# Home Run Derby\n\nThe Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting competition in Major League\nBaseball (MLB) customarily held the day before the MLB All-Star Game, which\nplaces the contest on a Monday in July. Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the\nevent has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based\ncompetition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.\n\n## History\n\nThe event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was not\ntelevised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-inning\nevent with each player receiving five outs per inning, allowing for the\npossibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on\nESPN. In 2000, a \"match play\"-style format was instituted for the second\nround. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player\nwith the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the\nsecond- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to\nthe finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition. The field\nof players selected currently consists of four American League players and\nfour National League players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each\nleague, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each\nleague, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players,\nwith five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the\nNL's four). In 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league\nformat. The only exception was 2005, when Major League Baseball changed the\nselection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries\ninstead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in\npromotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic, played in March 2006. In\n2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the\nformat was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides. Some\nnotable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005, who won the\nDerby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first\nround. The first-round record was broken in 2019 by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who\nhit 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home\nruns in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by\nGiancarlo Stanton, who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating Todd\nFrazier in the final round. The current overall record is held by Vladimir\nGuerrero Jr. at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only two participants, Yoenis\nC\u00e9spedes and Giancarlo Stanton, have won the Home Run Derby without being\nselected to the All-Star Game.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Format\n\n8 players duel in a home run challenge.\n\n#### 1985\u20131990\n\nIn the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players from both the AL and NL\nwere selected to participate. Each player was given 2 \"innings\" to hit as many\nhome runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. For the derby, an out is defined\nas any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player\nwith the most total home runs in the two innings.\n\n#### 1991\u20132005\n\nBeginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991\u20132006,\n8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before\nreaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top\nfour advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final. In\nhonor of the World Baseball Classic, the 2005 contest featured eight players\nfrom different countries. The format remained the same.\n\n#### 2006\u20132013\n\nThe format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each\nround, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with\nthe four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players\nwith the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.\n\n#### 2014\n\nThe Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to\nspeed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five\nplayers from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1,\nwith each players having seven \"outs.\" The player in each league with the\nhighest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the\nsecond- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round\n2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner\ncrowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each\nround stands alone, with the score reset for each round. Ties in any round are\nbroken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players remain tied, the players engage\nin a sudden-death swing-off until one player homers.\n\n#### 2015\u2013Present\n\nThe format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant change was the\nelimination of \"outs\", which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are\nseeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit\nas many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup\nadvances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up,\ntwo sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the\nwinner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is\ndetermined. Further, a player can get \"bonus time\" in the last minute of each\nround. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not\nrestart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time\ncould be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring\nat least are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of\nbonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over . Weather\nconcerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to\nfour minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of\nbonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least . The four-\nminute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time\nwas reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least . The\nadditional time was removed. Each batter is allowed one time-out during each\nround, and two in the finals. For 2017 and 2018, the first tie-breaker was\nincreased from a 1-minute swing off to minutes. However, it was not needed\neither of these years. The swing off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first\nyear in which it was used.\n\n### Gold balls\n\nFrom 2005\u20132013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in\n2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final\nminute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real\nEstate and Major League Baseball would donate $21,000 (a reference to the \"21\"\nin \"Century 21\") per home run to charity (MLB donated to the Boys and Girls\nClubs of America, and Century 21 donated to Easter Seals). In both 2005 and\n2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball\nhome runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated\n$17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the\nBoys and Girls Clubs of America. In the 2007 event, fifteen golden balls were\nhit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the 2008 event.\nFor 2009, State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000\nwas collected. For 2010, the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per\nhome run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since 2014 any homer hit off a\nT-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB,\nto Team Rubicon.\n\n## Television and radio coverage\n\nOn July 11, 1988, the day before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game from\nCincinnati, TBS televised the annual All-Star Gala from the Cincinnati Zoo.\nLarry King hosted the broadcast with Craig Sager and Pete Van Wieren handling\ninterviews. The broadcast's big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which\nTBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in prime time\nduring the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition\nwere canceled due to rain. The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in\n1993 on a same-day delayed basis, with the first live telecast in 1998.\nAlthough two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it\nhas rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to\nfour hours. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on\nESPN, including his catchphrase, \"Back back back\u2026Gone!\". Berman starts this\nphrase when the ball is hit, and does not say \"Gone!\" until the ball lands.\nThe 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic cable program. Because\nof the game's TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to\nparticipate. Notably, Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly declined to take part\nin 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game\nthe night before. After a discussion with ESPN's Joe Morgan and another with\nHall of Famer Frank Robinson, Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby\nat Coors Field. In Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network\nESPN Deportes. ESPN Radio also carries the event annually.\n\n### Most watched Home Run Derbys\n\n## Winners\n\n## Records\n\n### Most home runs in a single round\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs\n\n### Most single-derby home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Most all-time home runs\n\nNote: these numbers include swingoffs.\n\n### Wins by team\n\n## Complete scoreboard\n\n### 1980s\n\n#### 1985\n\n#### 1986\n\n#### 1987\n\n#### 1988\n\nHome Run Derby canceled due to rain.\n\n#### 1989\n\n### 1990s\n\n#### 1990\n\n#### 1991\n\n#### 1992\n\n#### 1993\n\n* Lost in playoff to Gonzalez \n\n#### 1994\n\n#### 1995\n\n* Beat Belle in finals \n\n#### 1996\n\n#### 1997\n\n* Beat Walker in finals \n\n#### 1998\n\n#### 1999\n\n* Lost to Burnitz in round 2 \n\n### 2000s\n\n#### 2000\n\n#### 2001\n\n#### 2002\n\n* Giambi defeated Konerko in a swing off \n\n#### 2003\n\n#### 2004\n\n#### 2005\n\n#### 2006\n\n#### 2007\n\n#### 2008\n\n#### 2009\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010\n\n#### 2011\n\n#### 2012\n\n#### 2013\n\n#### 2014\n\n  * designates bye round.  \n\n(designates swing off home runs).\n\n#### 2015 Great American Ball Park (Cincinnati)\n\n#### 2016 Petco Park (San Diego)\n\n#### 2017 Marlins Park (Miami)\n\n#### 2018 Nationals Park (Washington)\n\n#### 2019 Progressive Field (Cleveland)\n\n* Round went into three swing-offs after Guerrero Jr. and Pederson were tied with 29 home runs each. \n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Major League Baseball All-Star Games\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * MLB.com: Home Run Derby History\n  * Baseball-Almanac.com: Home Run Derby Results and Analysis\n  * Baseball Research Journal, SABR, \"Home Run Derby Curse, Fact or Fiction?\" by Joseph McCollum and Marcus Jaiclin\n\n"

As a child, he\nworked with his father on The Alvin Show by helping edit and coordinate the\nsoundtracks and falsetto voice-overs of The Chipmunks.\n\n## Career\n\nBagdasarian went to law school but after his father's death in 1972, succeeded\nhim as the President of Bagdasarian Productions, which had fallen into\nobscurity after significant success between 1958 and the late 1960s. His wife\nJanice Karman, whom he married in 1979, is co-president. Bagdasarian and\nKarman have two children and live in Montecito, California. Under\nBagdasarian's supervision, new Chipmunks records were created shortly after\nhis marriage to Karman, including Chipmunk Punk. In 1981, the Chipmunks\nreturned to television in the cartoon special A Chipmunk Christmas. Two years\nlater, Ruby-Spears Productions' Alvin and the Chipmunks Saturday morning\ncartoon series debuted on NBC. Based on that series, a feature film, The\nChipmunk Adventure was released in 1987. Bagdasarian voices Alvin, Simon, and\nDave Seville, and Karman voices Theodore and The Chipettes (Brittany,\nJeanette, and Eleanor). Bagdasarian and Karman hold tight creative and\nfinancial control over the Chipmunk franchise, reviewing each and every\nbusiness contract in great detail. In the mid-90s, Bagdasarian bought the\nChipmunk rights from brother Adam and sister Carol (a stay-at-home mother), to\ntake complete control.\n\n### Universal Pictures lawsuit\n\nBagdasarian licensed the rights to the Chipmunk characters to Universal\nPictures in 1996, resulting in a string of Universal-produced direct-to-video\nfilms. Four years later, he and Karman sued them for breach of contract,\nclaiming that Universal failed to properly utilize, market, and merchandise\nthe characters and hence resulting in a loss of royalties to Bagdasarian. The\ncase was decided in Bagdasarian's favor. \"For us, it was a custody battle\",\nKarman said. \"They finally realized 'OK, these two are really fighting for\ntheir kids'.\"\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n### Television\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * History at Chipmunks.com\n\n",

      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Sway (Rolling Stones song)\n\n\"Sway\" is a song by English rock band the Rolling Stones from their 1971 album\nSticky Fingers. It was also released as the b-side of the \"Wild Horses\" single\nin June 1971. This single was released in the US only. Initial pressings of\nthe single contain an alternate take; later pressings include the album\nversion instead.\n\n## Background\n\nCredited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \"Sway\" is a slower blues song and\nwas the first song recorded by the band at Stargroves. The song features a\nbottleneck slide guitar solo during the bridge and a dramatic, virtuoso outro\nsolo (both performed by Mick Taylor). Rhythm guitar performed by Jagger was\nhis first electric guitar performance on an album. The strings on the piece\nwere arranged by Paul Buckmaster, who also worked on \"Moonlight Mile\", another\nsong from Sticky Fingers. Richards added his backing vocals but provided no\nguitar to the track. Pete Townshend, Billy Nichols and Ronnie Lane are\nbelieved to contribute backing vocals as well. Taylor would later claim that\nhe felt he deserved writing credits on Sway and a few other songs, and the\nfact that he did not receive them was one of the causes of his departure from\nthe band.\n\n## Live\n\nIt was performed live for the first time in Columbus, Ohio, and then at many\nof the shows on the band's A Bigger Bang Tour in 2006. A seven-minute version\nof \"Sway\" appears on the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor Live at the Roxy album (also\nknown as Too Hot for Snakes). Taylor gets to stretch out and solo whereas the\nStones version faded at just under four minutes. Ian McLagan plays piano on\nthis version. During the Stones' \"50 & Counting\" concert tour in 2013, the\nband, accompanied by their guest Mick Taylor, played \"Sway\" during concerts at\nLos Angeles, Chicago and Boston. These concerts marked the first time that\nTaylor played on \"Sway\" at a Stones concert.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Mick Jaggerlead vocals, rhythm guitar\n  * Keith Richardsbacking vocals\n  * Mick Taylorlead guitar, slide guitar\n  * Bill Wymanbass guitar\n  * Charlie Wattsdrums\n  * Paul Buckmasterstring arrangement\n  * Nicky Hopkinspiano\n\n## Cover versions\n\nThe song was covered by the band Overwhelming Colorfast on the 1996\ncompilation album . It was also covered by Alvin Youngblood Hart on the\nOctober 1997 River North Records release, Paint It Blue: Songs Of The Rolling\nStones. Albert Castiglia covered the track on his 2014 album, Solid Ground.\nCarla Olson and Mick Taylor recorded a live version for their album Live: Too\nHot for Snakes.\n\n## References\n\n",

Mounduix later told\nfellow HouseGuest Kaycee Clark to open up her vagina, saying that it \"feels\ngood\". Viewers questioned Angela Rummans and Rachel Swindler after they were\ncaught on the live feeds making some questionable remarks. Rummans referred to\nher uneven tan lines as looking \"ghetto\", while Swindler compared her uneven\ntan lines to the skintone of fellow HouseGuest Bayleigh Dayton, who is African\nAmerican. CBS later released a statement and warned Rummans and Swindler with\nfuture consequences. Since the start of the live feeds, Kaitlyn Herman has\nbeen criticized from viewers for her feelings and actions towards several men\nin the Big Brother House, while being in a five-year relationship outside of\nthe house. In Week 3, Herman's then-boyfriend released a statement on Twitter,\nstating that he wanted to distance himself from the show and situation.\nKaitlyn Herman and Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix both came under fire after\nthey used the n-word in separate occasions. Herman used the word as she was\nsinging the lyrics of a Drake song. Mounduix used the word after fellow\nHouseGuest Bayleigh Dayton, who is African American, asked Mounduix if there\nis a \"difference between a midget and a dwarf\". Offended, Mounduix said that\nthe word \"midget\" is a derogatory term and then compared it to the n-word.\nMany came to the defense of the two, saying that they did not use the word\ntowards someone. Herman later apologized for using the word on an Instagram\nlive stream. During a live eviction episode, HouseGuest Brett Robinson called\nout Angela \"Rockstar\" Lantry in his eviction speech for \"strategic purposes\".\nLantry responded by confronting Robinson in his face, claiming that it was her\ndaughter's birthday. Lantry later called Robinson a \"rich, snobby, white-\nprivileged-ass dude\". Later that night, Lantry confronted Robinson with pots\nand pans during which she exclaimed that Robinson has a \"micropenis\". Upon\nconfrontation, Lantry sat between Robinson's legs who repeatedly asked her to\nget off of him. Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was criticized by fans after he\nasked Rachel Swindler if she was transgender, stating that she has \"a big\nAdam's apple.\" Mounduix proceeded to feel Swindler's neck, but she told him to\nstop. Moments later, he began to touch Swindler's neck again before being\nstopped by her. Viewers perceived some of Bayleigh Dayton's comments about\nFaysal Shafaat as being anti-Muslim. After Shafaat, a Muslim, complained about\nhis in-house crush Haleigh Broucher talking about her past sexual experiences,\nDayton claimed in private that Shafaat should \"go find a virgin\" and that he\nshould \"go to Pakistan and [get himself] one\" because \"that's what they do.\"\nMany viewers interpreted \"they\" as meaning Muslims. During a conversation\nbetween Dayton and Lantry, Dayton claimed that Lantry was the only white\nperson who she knew that did not like white people. Dayton then said that\nLantry dislikes \"normal white people\" more than she does. Days later, in a\nconversation with Haleigh Broucher, Dayton referred to her housemates as\n\"crazy-ass white people.\" Many viewers saw Dayton's statements as racist.\nJoseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was criticized by both fans and his fellow\nhousemates for making light of the #MeToo movement after making jokes at the\nmovement's expense. Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was once again involved in\ntwo separate sexual misconduct incidents in which he was accused of sexual\nharassment and sexual assault. While sleeping in the same bed, Mounduix was\nseen caressing Tyler Crispen's arm, face, and chest, as well as kissing his\narmpit while Crispen was sleeping. The following morning Crispen stated to\nKaycee Clark \"I\u2019m sleeping alone tonight \u2014 JC is not sleeping with me\".\nMounduix explained his version by stating that he was \"comforting Crispen who\nwas having nightmares\". Later, Mounduix opened the toilet door while\nHouseGuest Haleigh Broucher was using it. Broucher repeatedly asked Mounduix\nto close the door, who refused and tied the door open. Broucher then yelled\nfor assistance from production and later filed a complaint with executive\nproducer Allison Grodner. The producers later released a statement saying that\nneither Crispen nor Broucher filed official complaints and that the two had\nexpressed to them that they \"did not feel threatened or unsafe by Mounduix's\nactions.\" During a live eviction speech, HouseGuest Scottie Salton made sexual\nand vulgar comments towards HouseGuests Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans. He\nhinted that Crispen received oral sex from Rummans, which got censored out by\nCBS. Haleigh Broucher was criticized by both fans and her fellow HouseGuests\nafter making a joke about disabled people. During a conversation with Tyler\nCrispen and Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix, Broucher opened a fortune cookie\nthat read, \"Nothing can stop you from reaching your goals.\" After reading the\nquote, she responded by saying \"That is not true because if you are paralyzed,\nyou cannot reach anything.\" Crispen was quick to call her out, telling\nBroucher that it was \"the worst thing [he had] ever heard [her] say\". Crispen\nthen told Broucher that she needed \"to rephrase\" what she had just said, to\nwhich Mounduix added that he had seen disabled people achieve their goals.\n\n### Ratings\n\nUnless noted below, all episode aired in the United States on Sundays and\nWednesdays at 8:00 Eastern Standard Time (7:00 Central Standard Time) and live\nThursdays at 9:00 EST (8:00 CST).\n\n    * : Episode 21 was delayed to 8:20 PM EST (7:20 PM CST) due to the 2018 PGA Championship golf event running long.\n    * : Episode 36 was delayed to 8:37 PM EST (7:37 PM CST) due to an NFL football game running long.\n\n### Future of the series\n\nThe American adaptation of Big Brother has aired on CBS since its inception on\nJuly 5, 2000 with Julie Chen as host. Following two articles published by The\nNew Yorker by Ronan Farrow in July and September 2018, where several women\naccused Chen's husband Les Moonves of harassment, intimidation, and sexual\nmisconduct, effective September 9, 2018, Moonves departed CBS Corporation as\nPresident, Chairman and CEO, with Joseph Ianniello appointed as President and\nActing CEO. In response to the claims against him, Moonves released a\nstatement denying the allegations. After the first article was published, Chen\nreleased a statement on Twitter in July defending her husband. While Chen was\ninitially confirmed to return to the ninth season of her other CBS show The\nTalk, she was absent from the season premiere that aired on September 10,\n2018. Chen issued a statement where she was taking a few days off, but would\ncontinue with Big Brother. Chen's first television appearance since Moonves'\ndeparture was the live eviction on September 13, 2018, where she closed out\nthe episode with \"From outside the Big Brother house...I'm Julie Chen Moonves,\ngood night.\" The new sign-off broke with an established pattern that Chen has\nused in the past on Big Brother and showcased her support for her husband,\nwhile it received a mixed response from fans and viewers on Twitter. Chen\nsubsequently announced her departure from The Talk in a pre-recorded segment\nthat aired on the September 18, 2018 episode, where she stood outside the Big\nBrother house. Chen will continue to host Big Brother. The 20th season had\nbeen confirmed since August 10, 2016 as part of a two-year renewal between CBS\nand Fly on the Wall Entertainment, in association with Endemol Shine North\nAmerica.Celebrity Big Brother was renewed for a second season on May 12, 2018\nduring CBS' annual upfront for the 2018\u201319 television season. Speculation on\nthe status of the show intensified after the departure of Moonves from CBS,\nwith fans of the show and former HouseGuests began spreading the hashtag\n#SaveBBUSA in an attempt to get the program renewed. Unnamed insiders close to\nthe production of the show have cast doubt if Chen would return to host\npotential future installments if CBS renews the show. In an article from US\nWeekly, an insider noted that former HouseGuests Will Kirby, Ross Mathews, and\nBig Brother Canada host Arisa Cox have been mentioned as potential\nreplacements in the event that Chen does not to return, while TMZ reported\nthat Chen will continue with the show if the network decides to renew it. CBS\nbegan accepting online applications for a 21st season on September 20, 2018.\nAfter a few months of uncertainty, CBS officially announced that season 21\nwould go on during the summer.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n    * CBS Official Site\n\n"

      "# List of All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship finals\n\nThe Final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship is the ultimate match\nin the annual hurling competition organised since 1887 by the Gaelic Athletic\nAssociation (GAA). Contested by the top hurling teams in Ireland, the\ntournament has taken place every year, except in 1888, when the competition\nwas not played due to a tour of the United States by would-be competitors. The\nAll-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final was listed in second place by\nCNN in its \"10 sporting events you have to see live\", after the Olympic Games\nand ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship.\nThe latest All-Ireland Hurling Final was held at Croke Park, Dublin, on August\n18th 2019 and saw Tipperary beat Kilkenny at a score of 3-25 (Tipperary) to\n0-20 (Kilkenny). The final, held in the middle of August since the\nintroduction of the new format in 2018, serves as the culmination of a series\nof games played during the summer months, and the results determine which\ncounty's team receives the Liam MacCarthy Cup. The Championship was initially\na straight knockout competition open only to the champions of each of the four\nprovinces of Ireland. During the 1990s the competition was expanded, firstly\nincorporating a \"back-door system\" and later a round-robin group phase\ninvolving more games. The Championship currently consists of several stages.\nIn the present format, it begins in late May with provincial championships\nheld in Leinster and Munster. Once a team is defeated in the provincial stage\nthey are granted one more chance to compete for the title. The Munster and\nLeinster champions gain automatic admission to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling\nChampionship semi-finals, where they are joined by the two winners of the All-\nIreland Senior Hurling Championship qualifiers via two lone quarter-finals.\nThirteen teams currently participate in the Championship, the most dominant\nteams coming from the provinces of Leinster and Munster. Kilkenny, Cork and\nTipperary are considered \"the big three\" of hurling. Between them, these teams\nhave won 90 out of 125 (approx 72%) championships completed during its\nhistory. The title has been won by 13 different teams, 10 of which have won\nthe title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Kilkenny , who won\ntheir 36th title in 2015.\n\n## List of finals\n\n## Footnotes\n\na.

      "# 1998 Brisbane Broncos season\n\nThe 1998 Brisbane Broncos season was the eleventh in the history of Brisbane's\nNational Rugby League premiership team, the Brisbane Broncos. Coached by Wayne\nBennett and captained by Allan Langer, they participated in the newly formed\nNational Rugby League's 1998 premiership and posted their three biggest ever\nwins in rounds 5, 7 and 15 before finishing the regular season as minor\npremiers. The Broncos then won the 1998 NRL Grand Final, capturing their\nfourth premiership in seven seasons.\n\n## Season summary\n\nFor the 1998 season the Broncos were joined by Craig Bellamy who would work\nunder head coach Wayne Bennett as performance co-ordinator and assistant\ncoach. As could be expected by their finish to the 1997 season, Brisbane were\nsolid in their first five matches of 1998, snatching five victories. In rounds\nfive and seven, the Broncos won by a margin of 54 points, which was the club's\nrecord at the time. This was followed by shock losses to the Sydney City\nRoosters and Cronulla, but Langer led them to a big win over Canterbury only\nto see two more club losses. But the Broncos recovered to post huge wins over\nPenrith and the Western Suburbs Magpies. The Broncos finished the remainder of\nthe regular season undefeated finishing with 10 wins and 1 draw in their last\n11 games. The top try-scorer from the NRL season was Brisbane's Darren Smith.\nAfter a week off granted by winning the minor premiership, the Broncos were\nsmothered out of the game by Parramatta 15-10 in their opening finals match.\nBut they lifted and provided some miracle spark against the Melbourne Storm\n30-6 a week later, resurrecting their premiership hopes. A huge win over\nSydney City 46-18 in the preliminary final installed them at near unbackable\nodds against Canterbury in the first NRL Grand Final. The Broncos came back\nfrom a 12-10 half time deficit to again win consecutive premierships for the\nsecond time, and their fourth in seven seasons with a 38-12 Grand Final\nvictory. The Broncos were also named \"Queensland Sport Team of the Year\" at\nthe Queensland Sport Awards.\n\n## Match results\n\n^Game following a State of Origin match Brisbane Broncos NRL average home\nattendance in 1998: 20,073\n\n## Ladder\n\n## Grand final\n\nBrisbane Broncos vs. Canterbury Bulldogs Brisbane 38 (TRIES: De Vere, Campion,\nCarroll, Sailor, Tallis, Lee, Smith; GOALS Lockyer 5/7) defeated Canterbury 12\n(TRIES: Grimaldi, Talau; GOALS: Halligan 2/3) Halftime: Canterbury 12-10\nReferee: Bill Halligan Stadium: Sydney Football Stadium Crowd: 40, 857 Clive\nChurchill Medal: Gorden Tallis (Brisbane)\n\n## Scorers\n\n## Honours\n\n### League\n\n  * Premierhship\n  * Minor premiership\n\n### Club\n\n  * Player of the year: Andrew Gee\n  * Rookie of the year: Petero Civoniceva\n  * Back of the year: Kevin Walters\n  * Forward of the year: Shane Webcke\n  * Club man of the year: Brett Green\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * 1998 - Broncos Take Inaugural NRL Competition - rl1908.com\n\n",

      "# Galway\u2013Kilkenny hurling rivalry\n\nThe Galway-Kilkenny rivalry is a hurling rivalry between Irish county teams\nGalway and Kilkenny, who first played each other in 1898. Recently it has\nbecome one of the biggest rivalries in Gaelic games. Kilkenny's home ground is\nNowlan Park and Galway's home ground is Pearse Stadium, however, all of their\nchampionship meetings have been held at neutral venues. While Kilkenny have\nthe highest number of All-Ireland and Leinster titles, Galway were the\nstandard bearers in Connacht before joining the Leinster championship in 2009,\nhowever, All-Ireland success for them has been sporadic. Between them the two\nteams have won 41 All-Ireland championships.\n\n## History\n\nWhile Kilkenny is classed as one of the \"Big Three\", Galway is considered an\nin-between county, meaning it has some good years and some bad years. Galway\nhave always had the capability to stop the Kilkenny forces.\n\n## Statistics\n\n## Notable Matches\n\n  * Galway 5-18 : 4-18 Kilkenny (August 2005 Croke Park) - Lauded as the greatest game of the modern era, Galway went in as underdogs but managed to stun the hurling world by enialating Kilkenny in the opening 30 minutes leading 2-11:1-04 after 30 minutes. Kilkenny came back into it and trailed only by 2 points at the break 2-11:3-05. But 3 second-half goals by Niall Healy helped Galway to stay in front and bring them to a shocking win by 5-18:4-18.\n  * Kilkenny 1-19 : 1-12 Galway (July 2010 at Croke Park) - Galways first Leinster final pitted them against the mighty Kilkenny who were going for an infamous 5-In-A-Row All Irelands. Despite a strong start with Galway jumping to a 1-03:0-00 lead, Kilkenny soon got to grips and rallied to lead 0-14:1-05 at half time. Galway were unlucky not to win the second half (K 1-05:0-07 G), but never gave up and battled until the end.\n  * Galway 2-21 : 2-11 Kilkenny (July 2012 at Croke Park) - Kilkenny had become the Kings of hurling and were seen as unbeatable, that is until Anthony Cunninghams men took them on in the Leinster Final of 2012. Galway held Kilkeeny scoreless for 20 minutes and led at half time by 2-12:0-04. Kilkenny fought back in the second half, but it was never going to be enough as Galway finished strongly to win their first Leinster title by 2-21:2-11.\n  * Kilkenny 0-19 : 2-13 Galway (September 2012 at Croke Park) - The sides second meeting in the 2012 Trilogy was the All-Ireland final. Again Galway jumped into a lead 1-04:0-02 and held on to lead by 5 at the break 1-09:0-07, but sloppy defending meant they conceded 10 second half frees all converted by Henry Shefflin. Galway finished with a last-gasp free from Joe Canning to force a replay, final score Galway 2-13, Kilkenny 0-19.\n  * Kilkenny 3-22: 3-11 Galway (September 2012 #2 at Croke Park) - For the third match in 2012 Galway jumped into a 2-02:0-02 lead but that was the last we heard of Galway until the dying moments as Kilkenny dominated the rest of the match scoring 3-22 to win by eleven points.\n  * Galway 5-16 : 3-22 Kilkenny (June 2014 at O'Connor Park) - Galway came back from 10 points down with six minutes to play to force a draw. Joe Canning scored the last point of the game with the last play from out on the left near the touch-line to level the game after Henry Shefflin appeared to have won it for Kilkenny with a similar point at the other end.

Upon\nconfrontation, Lantry sat between Robinson's legs who repeatedly asked her to\nget off of him. Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was criticized by fans after he\nasked Rachel Swindler if she was transgender, stating that she has \"a big\nAdam's apple.\" Mounduix proceeded to feel Swindler's neck, but she told him to\nstop. Moments later, he began to touch Swindler's neck again before being\nstopped by her. Viewers perceived some of Bayleigh Dayton's comments about\nFaysal Shafaat as being anti-Muslim. After Shafaat, a Muslim, complained about\nhis in-house crush Haleigh Broucher talking about her past sexual experiences,\nDayton claimed in private that Shafaat should \"go find a virgin\" and that he\nshould \"go to Pakistan and [get himself] one\" because \"that's what they do.\"\nMany viewers interpreted \"they\" as meaning Muslims. During a conversation\nbetween Dayton and Lantry, Dayton claimed that Lantry was the only white\nperson who she knew that did not like white people. Dayton then said that\nLantry dislikes \"normal white people\" more than she does. Days later, in a\nconversation with Haleigh Broucher, Dayton referred to her housemates as\n\"crazy-ass white people.\" Many viewers saw Dayton's statements as racist.\nJoseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was criticized by both fans and his fellow\nhousemates for making light of the #MeToo movement after making jokes at the\nmovement's expense. Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix was once again involved in\ntwo separate sexual misconduct incidents in which he was accused of sexual\nharassment and sexual assault. While sleeping in the same bed, Mounduix was\nseen caressing Tyler Crispen's arm, face, and chest, as well as kissing his\narmpit while Crispen was sleeping. The following morning Crispen stated to\nKaycee Clark \"I\u2019m sleeping alone tonight \u2014 JC is not sleeping with me\".\nMounduix explained his version by stating that he was \"comforting Crispen who\nwas having nightmares\". Later, Mounduix opened the toilet door while\nHouseGuest Haleigh Broucher was using it. Broucher repeatedly asked Mounduix\nto close the door, who refused and tied the door open. Broucher then yelled\nfor assistance from production and later filed a complaint with executive\nproducer Allison Grodner. The producers later released a statement saying that\nneither Crispen nor Broucher filed official complaints and that the two had\nexpressed to them that they \"did not feel threatened or unsafe by Mounduix's\nactions.\" During a live eviction speech, HouseGuest Scottie Salton made sexual\nand vulgar comments towards HouseGuests Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans. He\nhinted that Crispen received oral sex from Rummans, which got censored out by\nCBS. Haleigh Broucher was criticized by both fans and her fellow HouseGuests\nafter making a joke about disabled people. During a conversation with Tyler\nCrispen and Joseph Charles \"JC\" Mounduix, Broucher opened a fortune cookie\nthat read, \"Nothing can stop you from reaching your goals.\" After reading the\nquote, she responded by saying \"That is not true because if you are paralyzed,\nyou cannot reach anything.\" Crispen was quick to call her out, telling\nBroucher that it was \"the worst thing [he had] ever heard [her] say\". Crispen\nthen told Broucher that she needed \"to rephrase\" what she had just said, to\nwhich Mounduix added that he had seen disabled people achieve their goals.\n\n### Ratings\n\nUnless noted below, all episode aired in the United States on Sundays and\nWednesdays at 8:00 Eastern Standard Time (7:00 Central Standard Time) and live\nThursdays at 9:00 EST (8:00 CST).\n\n    * : Episode 21 was delayed to 8:20 PM EST (7:20 PM CST) due to the 2018 PGA Championship golf event running long.\n    * : Episode 36 was delayed to 8:37 PM EST (7:37 PM CST) due to an NFL football game running long.\n\n### Future of the series\n\nThe American adaptation of Big Brother has aired on CBS since its inception on\nJuly 5, 2000 with Julie Chen as host. Following two articles published by The\nNew Yorker by Ronan Farrow in July and September 2018, where several women\naccused Chen's husband Les Moonves of harassment, intimidation, and sexual\nmisconduct, effective September 9, 2018, Moonves departed CBS Corporation as\nPresident, Chairman and CEO, with Joseph Ianniello appointed as President and\nActing CEO. In response to the claims against him, Moonves released a\nstatement denying the allegations. After the first article was published, Chen\nreleased a statement on Twitter in July defending her husband. While Chen was\ninitially confirmed to return to the ninth season of her other CBS show The\nTalk, she was absent from the season premiere that aired on September 10,\n2018. Chen issued a statement where she was taking a few days off, but would\ncontinue with Big Brother. Chen's first television appearance since Moonves'\ndeparture was the live eviction on September 13, 2018, where she closed out\nthe episode with \"From outside the Big Brother house...I'm Julie Chen Moonves,\ngood night.\" The new sign-off broke with an established pattern that Chen has\nused in the past on Big Brother and showcased her support for her husband,\nwhile it received a mixed response from fans and viewers on Twitter. Chen\nsubsequently announced her departure from The Talk in a pre-recorded segment\nthat aired on the September 18, 2018 episode, where she stood outside the Big\nBrother house. Chen will continue to host Big Brother. The 20th season had\nbeen confirmed since August 10, 2016 as part of a two-year renewal between CBS\nand Fly on the Wall Entertainment, in association with Endemol Shine North\nAmerica.Celebrity Big Brother was renewed for a second season on May 12, 2018\nduring CBS' annual upfront for the 2018\u201319 television season. Speculation on\nthe status of the show intensified after the departure of Moonves from CBS,\nwith fans of the show and former HouseGuests began spreading the hashtag\n#SaveBBUSA in an attempt to get the program renewed. Unnamed insiders close to\nthe production of the show have cast doubt if Chen would return to host\npotential future installments if CBS renews the show. In an article from US\nWeekly, an insider noted that former HouseGuests Will Kirby, Ross Mathews, and\nBig Brother Canada host Arisa Cox have been mentioned as potential\nreplacements in the event that Chen does not to return, while TMZ reported\nthat Chen will continue with the show if the network decides to renew it. CBS\nbegan accepting online applications for a 21st season on September 20, 2018.\nAfter a few months of uncertainty, CBS officially announced that season 21\nwould go on during the summer.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n    * CBS Official Site\n\n"

      "# West Highland White Terrier\n\nThe West Highland White Terrier, commonly known as the Westie, is a breed of\ndog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft\nwhite undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than\nother Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which\nfills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed is\nintelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not\nalways tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed,\nand is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.\nAdditionally, it is a hypoallergenic dog breed. The modern breed is descended\nfrom a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the\n20th century. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small\nrodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of\nPoltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his\nPoltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. Other related breeds\nincluded George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ\nEdwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish\nterriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with\nrecognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time. The breed\nremains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at Cruft's. It is in the\ntop third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in\ntelevision and film, including in Hamish Macbeth, and in advertising by\ncompanies such as Cesar dog food and Scotch whisky Black & White. Several\nbreed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a\ncondition in young dogs nicknamed \"westie jaw\" which causes an overgrowth of\nbone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a\nbreed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a\nvery energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around 1 hour\nper day.\n\n## Appearance\n\nCommonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in\ncolour. Their ears are pointed and erect. Members of the breed typically weigh\nbetween , and the average height is between at the withers. The body should be\nshorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder. They also have a deep\nchest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short, closely fitted jaw with\n\"scissors\" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper\nincisors locked over lower incisors). The Westie's paws are slightly turned\nout to give it better grip than flat-footed breeds when it climbs on rocky\nsurfaces. In young puppies, the nose and footpads have pink markings, which\nslowly turn black as they age. Westies also have short and sturdy tails. Some\nsources suggest that due to their history as rodent catchers, their tails were\nbred to be thick so that a Westie trapped in a hole could be easily pulled out\nby the tail. They have a soft, dense, thick undercoat and a rough outer coat,\nwhich can grow to about long. The fur fills out the face to give a rounded\nappearance. As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is\nnormally removed by either \"hand-stripping\", especially for dog-showing, or\notherwise clipping.\n\n## Temperament\n\nThe temperament of the West Highland White Terrier can vary greatly, with some\nbeing friendly towards children, while others prefer solitude. It will not\ntypically tolerate rough handling, such as a child pulling on its ears or fur,\nand can frequently be both food- and toy-possessive. This makes regular\ntraining from a young age of particular importance. It is normally\nindependent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is\na loyal breed that bonds with its owner but is often on the move, requiring\ndaily exercise (15\u201330 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most\nfriendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers. It is a hardy\nbreed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training. A Westie may need\nto have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a\ntypical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in toys,\nespecially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog,\nincluding inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts\nto bark and dig holes. It is ranked in the average range as 88th in Stanley\nCoren's The Intelligence of Dogs.\n\n## Health\n\nThe American breed club puts the lifespan of the Westie at 12 to 16 years. A\nclub survey puts the average lifespan at 11.4 years. Veterinary clinic data\nfrom the UK show a typical lifespan of 10.5 to 15 years. The French Kennel\nClub database gives 8 to 16 years, with a median of 13 years. The typical\nlitter size is between three and five puppies. The breed is predisposed to\nconditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias. Westie puppies may\nbe affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as \"lion\njaw\", and is sometimes also referred to as \"westie jaw\". The disease is an\nautosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both\nits parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many\nbreeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other\nunrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a\nyear old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food.\nRadiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the\nbones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased\ncalcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the\ntime the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally\ntreated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In\nsome cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot\neat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical\noption remaining. The breed is prone to skin disorders. About a quarter of\nWesties surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic\nallergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to\nfemales. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic\ndermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults\ndogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification,\nand hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as\nallergies or less serious forms of dermatitis. An inherited genetic problem\nthat exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-\nspecific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles\nand Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme\ngalactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and\ncan be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle\nweakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis\nbegins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid\nbreeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic\ncondition that affects the breed is \"white dog shaker syndrome\". As this\ncondition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was\noriginally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same\ncondition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the\nYorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one\nto three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and\nhypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths\nof time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while\nmales can be affected the rest of their lives. Other less common conditions\nwhich appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where\nelevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood\nplasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia,\nbut is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of\nthe hip joint, known as Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed.\nHowever, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other\nbreeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed\nis also one of the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where\nthe knee cap slips out of place.\n\n## History\n\nScottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of James VI\nof Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen\nterriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a\ngift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of\nother colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during\nthe breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the\nScottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds. Reports of a ship from the\nSpanish Armada being wrecked on the island of Skye in 1588 indicated the ship\ncarried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other\nbreeds by Clan Donald, including the families of the Chiefs. Other families on\nSkye preserved both white and sandy-coloured dogs. One such family was the\nClan MacLeod, and it was reported by their descendants that at least two\nChiefs kept white terriers, including \"The Wicked Man\" Norman MacLeod, and his\ngrandson Norman, who became Chief after his death. George Campbell, 8th Duke\nof Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers\nknown as the \"Roseneath Terrier\". Another breed of white Scottish terriers\nalso appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife\ndeveloping his line of \"Pittenweem Terriers\" out of a female Scottish Terrier\nwhich produced white offspring. The dog seemed to produce these white puppies\nregardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of\nthese offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the\nScottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He rededicated his breeding\nprogram to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the\nsame stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes\nbeing added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the\n19th century. The person most closely associated with developing the modern\nbreed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of\nPoltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a\nreddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm\ndecided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the\n\"Poltalloch Terrier\". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured\ncoats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in\nthe modern breed. It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem\nTerriers were interbred. In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be\nknown as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white\nterriers be renamed. The term \"West Highland White Terrier\" first appears in\nOtters and Otter Hunting by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908. The first breed\nclub was set up in 1904; Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, was the\nsociety's first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the\nCountess of Aberdeen as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the\nclub's second chairman. Kennel Club recognition followed in 1907, and the\nbreed appeared at Crufts for the first time in the same year. The Westie was\nimported into the United States in 1907\u20131908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch.\nKiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as\nthe Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the\nAmerican Kennel Club in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year\nto the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. The breed spent the period\nthat immediately followed as being \"in vogue\", becoming popular almost\nimmediately upon its arrival in the US. Canadian Kennel Club recognition\nfollowed in 1909. Until 1924 in the UK, Westie pedigrees were allowed to have\nCairn and Scottish Terriers in them. By the time of Malcolm's death in 1930, a\nstable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat, and a short back. In\nmajor conformation shows, the breed has been equally successful on both sides\nof the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was\nCh. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time\nas a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at\nthe age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised\nindependently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was\nreregistered as a West Highland White Terrier. The first win at a major show\ncame at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1942 when Constance Winant's\nCh. Wolvey Pattern of Edgerstoune won the title of Best in Show. The same\ntitle was taken by Barbara Worcester's Ch. Elfinbrook Simon in 1962. It took a\nfurther 14 years before the breed took its first Best in Show title at Crufts,\nthe UK's major dog show. Ch. Dianthus Buttons, owned by Kath Newstead and\nDorothy Taylor, took the title for the breed in 1976. A Westie also won Crufts\nin 1990 with the Best in Show title going to Derek Tattersall's Ch. Olac Moon\nPilot, and in 2016 to Burneze Geordie Girl. The popularity of the breed during\nthe early 20th century was such that dogs were being exchanged for hundreds of\nguineas. As of 2010, the Westie is the third-most popular breed of terrier in\nthe UK, with 5,361 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. However, this is a\ndecrease in numbers since 2001, when it was the most popular terrier breed,\nwith 11,019 new dogs registered. The breed's position in the United States is\nmore stable with it remaining in the top third of all breeds since around\n1960. It was ranked 30th-most popular in 2001, based on registrations with the\nAmerican Kennel Club, which has varied around the 30s in the decade since,\nwith it ranked 34th in 2010.\n\n## In popular culture\n\n### In public life\n\n  * Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, owned a Westie.\n  * John Green, novelist, co-founder of the VlogBrothers, is known to own a Westie, called Willie (or Fireball Wilson Roberts).\n  * J.

According to this criterion, the longest human lifespan is\nthat of Jeanne Calment of France (1875\u20131997), who lived to age 122 years, 164\ndays. She supposedly met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13. She received\nnews media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation\nfound documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the\nrecords of her native city, Arles, France. More evidence of Calment's lifespan\nhas been produced than for any other supercentenarian, such that her case\nserves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the\nworld's oldest people. However, Calment's age was nevertheless disputed in a\n2018 study which hypothesized that Calment's daughter Yvonne, born in 1898 and\nclaimed to have died in 1934, usurped Jeanne's identity upon her mother's\ndeath, and which still is not resolved almost a year later. Other researchers\nhave dismissed this hypothesis on the basis of extensive prior research into\nCalment's life. The longest human lifespan which is undisputed is that of\nSarah Knauss of the United States (1880\u20131999), who lived to age 119 years, 97\ndays. As women live longer than men on average, combined records for both\nsexes are predominated by women. The longest lifespan for a man is that of\nJiroemon Kimura of Japan (1897\u20132013), who lived to age 116 years, 54 days.\nSince the death of 117-year-old Chiyo Miyako of Japan on 22 July 2018, -year-\nold Kane Tanaka, also of Japan, born 2 January 1903, is the oldest living\nperson in the world whose age has been validated.

      "# Upland hunting\n\nUpland hunting is an American term for a form of bird hunting in which the\nhunter pursues upland birds including quail, pheasant, grouse, woodcock,\nprairie chicken, chukar, grey partridge, and others. Upland birds tend to be\nfound on the ground in heavy cover, so hunters generally employ the use of gun\ndogs to locate and retrieve game. The average group consists of 2-4 hunters\nwith 1-2 dogs. Normally, if there is one dog the owner usually handles the dog\nwhile the others focus on shooting. Upland bird hunting and clay pigeon\nshooting have both been widely accepted as gentlemanly activities but it was\nmore prevalent in the past. For example; a man may take his father in law out\non a hunting trip. It is also an activity for business outings. Depending upon\ntheir method of work, some dogs point game and some flush game. When flushed,\neither by the hunter or the dog, the hunter then attempts to shoot the birds\non the wing. This is also known as wingshooting. Upland hunting encompasses\nsome of the activities that takes place in rough shooting in the United\nKingdom.\n\n## Equipment\n\nUpland hunters use all types of shotguns from break-breach guns to semi-\nautomatics, and .410 bore through 12 gauge. The quintessential shotgun for\nupland hunting is a double barrel shotgun in a smaller gauge such as a 16, 20\nor 28 gauge. Upland guns can be extremely valuable, often commanding many\nthousands of dollars. In America (though not in the UK), some states, such as\nAlabama and Arkansas, require upland hunters to wear blaze orange clothing for\nsafety. They often wear vests to carry game, though there is a recent trend\ntoward more functional technical daypacks specifically designed for the\ndemands of more rigorous upland hunting in remote areas.\n\n## Dogs\n\nUpland hunters work specially trained gun dogs to find game. Spaniels and\npointing breeds are used most often, though retrievers are worked with\nconsiderable success when hunting pheasant in many areas. Upland hunters\ntraditionally walk when finding game, though quail hunters in the Southern\nStates often employ hunting buggies or vehicles due to the sparseness of game.\nBecause of the large area that must be covered in order to find bobwhite quail\nmany hunters employ specially designed hunting buggies to haul gear and\nkennels for fresh dogs. On the other hand, chukar and Hungarian partridge\nhunters of much of the western U.S. will hunt with one or two dogs on the\nground for the duration of the hunt, hiking 8+ miles of steep mountain terrain\nin a single hunt with well conditioned dogs. An important component of upland\nhunting for hunters is their partnership with their canine hunting companion.\nThe breed of dog chosen by a hunter should first and foremost fit the style of\nhunting of the hunter and then the primary type of upland bird being hunted\nfor the relationship to be successful. A puppy's training may begin when the\ndog is around 4 months old. Training often involves reinforcement of canine\nhunting instinct, and some common training tools are: whistles, 6 & 20 ft\nchoke leashes, and shock collars. A puppy can be brought into the field within\na year, but dogs reach prime ability at closer to 3 or 4 years old.\n\n## Location\n\nPheasant hunting, the most popular form of upland hunting takes place\nprimarily in open fields which provides cover for birds. Upland birds can be\nhunted in a wide variety of habitats from deserts to high mountain elevations.\nThis variety of locations is part of what makes upland hunting so popular.\nSome states such as South Dakota derive a significant portion of their revenue\nfrom upland hunters who travel into the state to take advantage of the ideal\nsettings. Numerous pheasant hunting lodges are prevalent throughout South\nDakota. Most of them are in the eastern half of the state. Location is\nimportant when deciding the species of upland bird you want to hunt. Upland\nbirds are found throughout the United States and much of the world. Although\nthis sport is most popular, by number of participants, in the United States.\nThere are two different ways that hunters can approach upland hunting. the\nmore challenging way is hunting wild birds. This is done in less populated\nparts of the country especially the midwest. The second way is hunting farmed\nbirds. Popular birds by region in the United States:\n\n  * Eastern/Northeast: forest grouse\n  * Southeast: bobwhite quail\n  * South: bobwhite quail\n  * Midwest/Prairie: pheasants, prairie grouse\n  * North Central Tier: forest grouse\n  * Intermountain West: partridge, sage-grouse, prairie grouse\n  * West: partridge, quail\n\n## See also\n\n  * Upland game\n\n## References\n\nPHEASANT HUNTING TIPS\n\n"

      "# Nissan Leaf\n\nThe , stylised by manufacturer Nissan as LEAF, is a compact five-door\nhatchback battery electric vehicle, introduced in Japan and the United States\nin December 2010, and now in its second generation. Its range on a full charge\nis . Among other awards and recognition, the Leaf has won the 2010 Green Car\nVision Award, the 2011 European Car of the Year, the 2011 World Car of the\nYear, and the 2011\u20132012 Car of the Year Japan. Global sales totaled over\n400,000 Leafs by March 2019. The United States is its largest market, with\n126,747 sold through October 2018; followed by Japan with 100,000 units by\nApril 2018; and Europe with 100,000 by June 2018. The European market was led\nby Norway with 33,156 new units registered by the end of October 2018.\n\n## First generation (2010\u20132017)\n\n### Design\n\nNissan sought to make the Leaf appealing to mainstream drivers by giving it a\nfamiliar five-door hatchback design. The body has a sharp V-shape design with\nlarge, up slanting headlights that split and redirect airflow away from the\ndoor mirrors, and the bottom of the car has aerodynamic panelling. The\nbattery, the heaviest part of most electric vehicles, is situated below the\nseats and rear foot space, keeping the center of gravity as low as possible\nand giving the car better structural rigidity than a conventional five-door\nhatchback. The Leaf is powered by an electric synchronous motor with and\ndriving the front wheels. The Leaf was initially equipped with a lithium ion\nbattery, later increased to . The battery is manufactured by Automotive Energy\nSupply Corporation. It's guaranteed for eight years or 100,000 miles. There is\nno active cooling of the battery pack, only passive cooling by radiation.\nThere is a battery refurbishment program in Japan, but not in the US.\nAccording to a 2015 report by Warranty Direct, of 35,000 Leafs sold in Europe,\nthree had had a battery failure, compared to a failure rate 25 times higher\nfor internal combustion engined cars. Nissan reports the 2011 Leaf has a and\nthe 2013 model . The Leaf is generally cheaper to operate than gasoline and\nhybrid cars. However, since the Leaf costs significantly more than similar\ngasoline-powered vehicles, it may take a long time for the fuel savings to\ncancel out the increased initial cost, even after government incentives for\nplug-in electric vehicles. The body features bulging headlamp enclosures which\ndirect wind away from the side mirrors, reducing drag and noise. Some trims\ninitially came equipped with the telematics system CarWings. From 2011 to 2015\nthis used the 2G cellular network. 2G has been decommissioned in many areas,\nrequiring an upgrade of the telematic control unit to use newer networks.\nRebranded NissanConnectEV in 2016, it is provided provided free of charge to\nowners, if equipped, depending on year and trim. As of 2017 it offers GPS data\nfor routing, and for locating charging stations. It may also provide two-way\ncommunication with the car which enables remote control of the climate system,\nand monitoring of charging status,\n\n### Model and production history\n\nNissan electric vehicles has existed since 1946 and the Leaf was preceded by\nthe Altra, and the Hypermini.\n\n#### 2011/12\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated it 21.2 /100 km.\nIt is on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). US-market S and SV trims had\nan SAE J1772 connector for (120/220 volts AC). Using mains electricity and the\nincluded cable, the car regains about five miles of range per hour. The SL\ntrim had a CHAdeMO port with which it can be charged from fully discharged to\n80% capacity in about 30 minutes. Nissan warns that if fast charging is the\nprimary way of recharging, then the normal and gradual battery capacity loss\nis about 10% more than regular 220-volt charging over a 10-year period. Other\ncompanies make compatible charging stations, and companies and local\ngovernment have various initiatives to create electric vehicle networks of\npublic charging stations. The 2011/12 model Leaf has a top speed of over . The\nmotoring press has reported a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 9.9\nseconds. About a dozen Leaf Nismo RC (Racing Competition) vehicles were\nproduced, with the same motor but otherwise optimized for racing.\n\n#### 2013\n\nBy March Nissan had plants at Smyrna, Tennessee, Oppama, Japan, and\nSunderland, England, with production of 150,000, 50,000, and 50,000\nrespectively. The 2013 Leaf has extended range due to a more efficient heating\nsystem, better regenerative braking, weight reduction, and improved\naerodynamics. The EPA rating is , a slight increase from in 2011 and 2012\nmodels also due to technicality in the rating system. The 2013 model year Leaf\nhas a dashboard display of the battery's charge percentage. A 6.6-kW onboard\ncharger, available as an extra-cost option on the base model, reduces charging\ntimes using 240-volt power, so a charge from empty to full takes about four\nhours, instead of seven. The onboard charger is more compact and located under\nthe hood, increasing cargo volume. In November Nissan demonstrated on public\nroads a Leaf based driverless car There are three trim levels. A new trim\nlevel, Leaf S, has a lower price and 16-inch steel wheels and fewer\naccessories. In Europe Nissan offered a battery leasing option for all trims\nproduced at Sunderland which lowered the price.\n\n#### 2014/15\n\nThe official EPA range for the 2014 and 2015 model year Leaf, increased from .\nThe 2014 Leaf is largely the same as the 2013 model year, except for standard\nrearView monitor and updated EV-IT functionality with voice destination entry\nand SMS readout. In China, the Leaf-based Venucia e30 went on sale.\n\n#### 2016\n\nBeginning in late 2016, all three trims (S, SV, and SL) came equipped with\nboth charging receptacles. A larger 30 kWh battery in the US-market SL and SV\ntrims boosted range to . The S trim initially kept the 24 kWh battery found in\nearlier Leafs, and received the upgrade midway through the 2016 model year.\nWith the new battery pack Nissan extended the warranty to 96 months or . This\nmeans that if a car lost four of the 12 bars on its capacity gauge before that\nperiod is up, Nissan would replace or repair the battery free of charge.\n\n#### 2017\n\nGlobal sales in 2017 fell to about 47,000 units, in anticipation of the second\ngeneration. , the Leaf was available in more than 60 countries in four\ncontinents.\n\n### Environmental footprint\n\nIn February 2014, the Automotive Science Group (ASG) published the result of a\nstudy conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1,300 automobiles across nine\ncategories sold in North America. The study found that among advanced\nautomotive technologies, the Nissan Leaf holds the smallest life-cycle\nenvironmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the\nNorth American market with minimum four-person occupancy. The study concluded\nthat the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the battery electric\ntechnology is more than offset with increased environmental performance during\noperational life. For the assessment, the study used the average electricity\nmix of the U.S. grid in 2014. In December 2014, Nissan announced that Leaf\nowners have accumulated together 1 billion kilometers (625 million miles)\ndriven. This amount of electric miles translates into avoiding 180 million\nkilograms of emissions by driving an electric car in comparison to travelling\nwith a gasoline-powered car. In December 2016, Nissan reported that Leaf\nowners worldwide achieved the milestone of 3 billion kilometers (1.9 billion\nmiles) driven collectively through November 2016, saving nearly 500 million\nkilograms of emissions. Models with an on-board 3.6 kW charger can be fully\ncharged in eight hours from an appropriate 240-volt charger, while models with\nan on-board 6.6 kW charger can be fully recharged in 4 hours.\n\n### Limited options for replacement battery packs\n\nAfter the original battery packs degrade, owners may wish to refurbish,\nreplace, or upgrade their battery packs instead of purchasing a new electric\ncar. However, there are few options globally for this process. In August of\n2019, Automotive News reported that \"more than a year after launching a\nbattery refurbishment program for Leaf customers in Japan, Nissan remains\nnoncommittal about offering the program in the brand's largest market \u2014 the\nU.S.\" Nissan previously offered a replacement battery back for the Leaf for\n$5,499 plus installation in the U.S., but then later raised the price to\n$8,500.\n\n### Safety\n\nNHTSA rates the 2011 and 2012 model years as five out of five stars overall.\nIt won the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's \"Top Safety Pick\" in 2011.\nIt received top ratings of \"Good\" for front, side, and rear impact crash\ntests, and also on rollover protection. All injury measurements except one\nwere rated good, indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes\naccording to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS's testing. The\nEuropean New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) awarded the Leaf the highest\nfive-star car safety rating, earning the following ratings for each criterion:\nIn the case of an accident in which the airbags are deployed, the Leaf\nautomatically disconnects the high-voltage system. In December 2010, Nissan\nalso advised first responders to manually disconnect both the high voltage and\n12 V systems before performing any first response actions. The Nissan Leaf's\nbattery pack is shielded from crash damage by structural steel reinforcement.\nIn December 2011, Nissan reported that none of the around two dozen Leafs\ndestroyed in the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami caught fire, and that\ntheir batteries remained intact. , no fires after a crash have been reported\nin the U.S. associated with the Leaf or other plug-in electric cars available\nin the market. In 2011 electric vehicle warning sounds, to alert pedestrians\nof the Leaf's quiet movement relative to traditional motor vehicles, were\nintroduced in anticipation of legislation mandating it in Europe, Japan, and\nAmerica. This sound varies according to direction and acceleration, and is\nonly active at low speeds. It can be disabled on some models. Actual\nlegislation requiring this did not come into effect until 2019 in the EU and\n2010 in the US.\n\n### Awards\n\nAt the 2010 Washington Auto Show, the Leaf was given the Green Car Vision\nAward by the Green Car Journal, which said that the Leaf \"will provide the\nfeatures, the styling, and the driving experience that will meet the needs of\na sophisticated and demanding market, while producing zero localized emissions\nand requiring no petroleum fuels.\" Popular Mechanics, upon awarding the Leaf\nits 2010 Breakthrough Award, explained that the Nissan Leaf is \"not the first\npure EV, but [...] hits the mainstream like none of its predecessors.\" Popular\nMechanics also alluded to the Leaf's range, which is said to be \"enough for\nmost commuters for the price of an average vehicle and with a much lower\noperating cost than gasoline-powered vehicles.\" Other awards received by the\nLeaf include the 2011 European Car of the Year, EV.com's 2011 EV of the Year,\n2011 Eco-Friendly Car of the Year by Cars.com, 2011 Green Fleet Electric\nVehicle of the Year, it was listed among the 2011 Greenest Vehicles of the\nYear by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, also listed by\nMother Earth News among its \"Best Green Cars\" of 2011, and also was ranked\nfirst in Kelley Blue Book Top 10 Green Cars for 2011. The Leaf won the 2011\nWorld Car of the Year, and was a finalist for the 2011 World Green Car. Ward's\nAuto listed the Leaf's 80 kW electric motor in Ward's 10 Best Engines for\n2011. Until October 2011 the Leaf was ranked as the most efficient EPA\ncertified vehicle for all fuels ever. In December 2011, the Leaf was awarded\nwith the 2011\u20132012 Car of the Year Japan at the Tokyo Motor Show.\n\n### Motorsport\n\nAn Electric Production Class was formed for the 2011 Pikes Peak International\nHill Climb and Chad Hord raced a Leaf in the event. The off-road racing driver\nascended the course in 14 minutes and 33 seconds to win the class. The\ninterior of the car was removed and replaced with mandatory racing seats,\nsafety harness, and a roll cage.\n\n### Global sales\n\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2009. After receiving 20,000\npre-orders in the United States, Nissan stopped taking reservations in the\nUnited States until early 2011. Production in Japan started in October 2010,\nand delivery in the US and Japan began in December, with deliveries in other\nmarkets beginning in early 2012. The Leaf was the world's best selling\nelectric car from 2011 to 2014 and 2016. Sales fell in 2015 with overall sales\nled by the Tesla Model S.\n\n## Second generation (2017-present)\n\nIn October 2017, for the 2018 model year, Nissan launched the new generation\nLeaf in Japan, and deliveries in the U.S. and Europe began in February 2018.\nIn 2018, global sales reached a record level of 87,149 units, third behind the\nTesla Model 3 and the BAIC EC-Series. Mechanically, the second generation Leaf\nis similar to the first, while adding longer range, and more power.\nStylistically, it is a major departure from the previous model. The interior\nadds Apple CarPlay. It has a 40 kWh battery pack with an EPA-rated range of .\nThe electric motor produces and of torque. It charges through either a 6.6 kW\nregular plug (SAE J1772 in US/Japan, or a Type 2 connector in EU countries) or\na 50 kW CHAdeMO, and has the ability to send power back to the grid. Propilot\nAssist, a lane centering system, is available on the two highest trim levels\nfor an additional cost, and has automatic parking in some markets. The car\noffers one-pedal braking where easing off the accelerator pedal causes\nsignificant regenerative braking, to the point where the vehicle can be\nbrought to a complete stop without the driver touching the brake pedal, at\nwhich point hydraulic brakes are automatically applied, to hold the vehicle in\nposition. From 2019, a Leaf e+ (Leaf Plus in North America) variant has been\noffered. It has a larger 62 kWh battery providing a range of , and a new 150\nkW motor with 33% more power. It can use CHAdeMO chargers up to 100 kW.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Electric car use by country\n  * List of best-selling automobiles\n  * List of electric cars currently available\n  * List of modern production plug-in electric vehicles\n  * List of production battery electric vehicles\n  * Revenge of the Electric Car: 2011 American film documenting how the electric car was brought to world markets.\n  * Zero-emissions vehicle: a vehicle that emits no exhaust gas from the onboard source of power.\n\n## Gallery\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Nissan Leaf electric range variability for different ambient temperatures\n  * Nissan is observing electrons to improve Leaf Battery performance by 150%\n\n"

It was written by composer Richard\nRodgers and lyricist/librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The leading male\ncharacter in Oklahoma!, Curly McLain, sings the song at the beginning of the\nfirst scene of the musical. The refrain runs: \"Oh, what a beautiful mornin'! /\nOh, what a beautiful day! / I've got a beautiful feelin' / Ev'rythin's goin'\nmy way.\" Curly's \"brimming optimism is perfectly captured by Rodgers'\nebullient music and Hammerstein's buoyant pastoral lyrics.\" This was the first\nsong of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical collaboration to be heard by theatre\naudiences. It has become one of their most famous numbers and \"quickly became\none of the most popular American songs to emerge from the wartime era, gaining\ncurrency away from Broadway first on the radio and recordings, and then later\non numerous television variety shows.\" Brooks Atkinson, reviewing the original\nproduction in The New York Times, wrote that the number changed the history of\nmusical theatre: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the\nbanalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\"\n\n## Noteworthy recordings\n\nNoteworthy recordings include the following:\n\n  * Bing Crosby and Trudy Erwin recorded the song in 1943 for Decca, as the B-side of a single covering \"People Will Say We're In Love\". The recording peaked at No. 4 on US charts.\n  * Frank Sinatra recorded the song as a single in 1943, released by Columbia Records as catalogue number 36682, it reached the No. 12 spot in the charts. The song appears on more than two dozen Frank Sinatra compilations. Sinatra first recorded the song a cappella: \"a musician's strike ... occurred just as Sinatra was set to enter the studio and lay down his first tracks under the Columbia banner, so ... Sinatra went into the studio with a group of vocalists and recorded several songs ... a cappella\".\n  * Ray Charles recorded the song several times, and one of his live recordings from the 1970s with the Count Basie Orchestra is included on his posthumous album Ray Sings, Basie Swings (2006)\n  * Eels included the song on their live album Oh What a Beautiful Morning (2000).\n  * James Taylor recorded the song in 2008 and released it as a bonus track on his album Covers (2008) and also on his album Other Covers (2009).\n  * Sharon, Lois & Bram recorded a version and performed it on their television program, Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show.\n\nOther artists who have recorded the song include Rosemary Clooney on several\nof her albums, Peggy Lee, Nelson Eddy, and Joanie Bartels. Classical singers\nwho have recorded it include Placido Domingo, Bryn Terfel, Marilyn Horne and\nSamuel Ramey, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir made a choral version.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nEthan Mordden titled his book about the dawn of the \"Golden Age\" of musicals\nBeautiful Mornin: The Broadway Musical in the 1940s (1999).\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\": Gordon MacRae sings the song in the original film version (1955)\n  * \"Great Performances\" version: Hugh Jackman sings the song in the PBS production of Oklahoma!

      "# Audi R8\n\nThe Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car, which uses Audi's trademark\nquattro permanent all-wheel drive system. It was introduced by the German car\nmanufacturer Audi AG in 2006. The car is exclusively designed, developed, and\nmanufactured by Audi AG's private subsidiary company manufacturing high\nperformance automotive parts, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH), and is\nbased on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the Hurac\u00e1n platform. The\nfundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses\nan aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is\nbuilt by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium\nsite' at Neckarsulm in Germany. It is also the first production car with full-\nLED headlamps.\n\n## First generation (2006\u20132015: Type 42)\n\nThe Audi R8, based on the Audi Le Mans quattro concept car (designed by Frank\nLamberty and Julian Hoenig) first appeared at the 2003 International Geneva\nMotor Show and the 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show. The R8 road car\nwas officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September 2006. There was\nsome confusion with the name, which the car shares with the 24 Hours of Le\nMans winning R8 Le Mans Prototype (LMP). Initial models included the R8 4.2\nFSI coup\u00e9 (with a V8 engine) and R8 5.2 FSI coup\u00e9 (with a V10 engine).\nConvertible models, called the Spyder by the manufacturer, were introduced in\n2008. Followed by the high-performance GT model introduced in 2011. The\nMotorsport variants of the R8 were also subsequently introduced from 2008\nonwards. An all-electric version called the e-Tron started development but\nwould only reach production stage when the second generation model would be\nintroduced. 6-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Jacky Ickx described the R8 as\n\"the best handling road car today\". The car received a facelift in 2012 and a\nnew model called the V10 Plus was now added to the range. Production of the\nType 42 ended in August 2015.\n\n## Second generation (2015\u2013present: Type 4S)\n\nThe second generation of the R8 (model code: Type 4S) was unveiled at the 2015\nGeneva Motor Show and is based on the Modular Sports System platform shared\nwith the Lamborghini Huracan. The development of the Type 4S commenced in late\n2013 and was completed in late 2014. Initial models included the all-electric\ne-Tron and the V10 5.2 FSI along with the V10 plus. Unlike its predecessor,\nthere was no manual transmission available and the entry-level V8 trim was\nalso dropped. In 2016, the convertible (Spyder) variant was added to the line\nup which was initially available in the base V10 trim. In mid-2017, the high\nperformance V10 plus Spyder was added to the range. A rear-wheel-drive model\ncalled the R8 RWS was introduced. In 2018, the R8 received a mid-cycle refresh\nwith mechanical and exterior changes. The newer and more aggressive design\nlanguage carried over from famous Audi models of the past. Some of the\naerodynamic features such as the front aeroblades are shared with the\nLamborghini Hurac\u00e0n. The refreshed model had substantial performance\nimprovements over its predecessor.\n\n## Production, available markets and sales\n\nTo produce the R8 at Audi Sport GmbH, 70 workers fit 5,000 different parts by\nhand. The factory at Neckarsulm, redeveloped at a cost of \u20ac28 million, usually\nproduces between eight and fifteen cars a day, up to a maximum daily output of\n29 cars. Ninety-five lasers inspect the entire car in five seconds to ensure\nthat over 220 measurements are within 0.1 millimetres of the programmed plans.\n\n### Sales world wide\n\nIn Asia, the R8 is available in Bahrain, Kuwait, Pakistan, India, Israel,\nJapan, Taiwan, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and\nhas been available in China, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, and\nIndonesia since 2008.\n\n### Sales figures in the U.S\n\n### Sales figures in Europe\n\nEuropean statistics include sales from the following countries: Austria,\nBelgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreat Britain, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.\n\n### Sales figures in Canada\n\n## Marketing\n\n### Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nThe R8 became the personal vehicle for Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey\nJr.) throughout six films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Type 42 models\nwere used in the Iron Man Trilogy with a V8 in Iron Man, a V10 Spyder in Iron\nMan 2, and an e-tron prototype in Iron Man 3. Type 4S models appeared in later\nMarvel Studios movies with 2016 V10 Plus models in and and a Spyder model in .\n\n## See also\n\n  * Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n (built on same platform)\n  * Audi Le Mans quattro\n  * Audi S and RS models\n  * Lamborghini Gallardo (built on same platform)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Official Audi R8 website\n\n",
      "# O. Henry's Full House\n\nO. Henry's Full House is a 1952 American anthology film made by 20th Century\nFox, consisting of five films, each based on a story by O. Henry. The film was\nproduced by Andr\u00e9 Hakim and directed by five directors from five screenplays\nwith different authors. The music score was composed by Alfred Newman. The\nfilm is narrated by author John Steinbeck, who made his only on-camera\nappearance to introduce each story. Howard Hawks \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" was\nso poorly received that the studio removed it before the film opened widely.\n\n## The five stories\n\n### \"The Cop and the Anthem\"\n\nDirected by Henry Koster, from a screenplay by Lamar Trotti, it stars Charles\nLaughton, Marilyn Monroe and David Wayne. As winter approaches, a vagrant\ndecides it's time for his annual winter spell in prison. But no matter how\nhard he tries, he cannot get himself arrested.\n\n### \"The Clarion Call\"\n\nDirected by Henry Hathaway, from a screenplay by Richard L. Breen, it stars\nDale Robertson and Richard Widmark. Plot: A detective cannot arrest a murderer\nhe knows from his past due to his honor involving an outstanding financial\ndebt to the criminal. Once a newspaper offers a reward, after being mocked by\nthe criminal, the detective arrests the criminal and collects the reward to\nrepay the debt. This vignette reunited Henry Hathaway and Richard Widmark\nwho'd worked together on the noir classic Kiss of Death (1947). Widmark's\ncharacter in The Clarion Call, \"Johnny Kernan\", is actually a reprise of his\nOscar-nominated character \"Tommy Udo\" from Kiss of Death. Widmark's Udo/Kernan\ncharacter was inspired by his love of Batman comics' \"The Joker\". The Tommy\nUdo performance in turn influenced Frank Gorshin in preparation for his\n\"Riddler\" character on the Batman TV series in the 1960s.\n\n### \"The Last Leaf\"\n\nDirected by Jean Negulesco, from a screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, it\nstars Anne Baxter, Jean Peters, and Gregory Ratoff. The story is set in\nGreenwich Village during a pneumonia epidemic. An old artist saves the life of\na young artist, dying of pneumonia, by giving her the will to live. She can\nsee an ivy plant through the window gradually losing its leaves, and has taken\nit into her head that she will die when the last leaf falls. Seemingly, it\nnever does fall, and she survives. In reality, the vine lost all its leaves.\nWhat she thought she saw was in actuality a leaf, painted on the wall with\nperfect realism, by the old artist. The old artist dies of a heart attack\nwhile out in the wet and cold, painting the last leaf.\n\n### \"The Ransom of Red Chief\"\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks, from a screenplay by Ben Hecht, Nunnally Johnson and\nCharles Lederer, it stars Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Lee Aaker. Two con men\nkidnap a child in order to collect a substantial ransom, but the child proves\nto be too much for them.\n\n### \"The Gift of the Magi\"\n\nDirected by Henry King, from a screenplay by Walter Bullock, it stars Jeanne\nCrain and Farley Granger. On Christmas Eve, with little money, Della sells her\nhair to buy her husband Jim a watch fob. Jim has sold his watch to buy her a\npair of ornamental combs. When they exchange these now useless gifts, they\nrealize how deep is their love for one another.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Review at TimeOut Film\n  * Review at Channel 4 Film\n  * Review at Family Friendly Movies\n\n",
      "# Dirty Harry (song)\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" is a song from British alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz'\nsecond studio album Demon Days.\n\n## Song history\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" was first released as a promotional single on iTunes before\nbeing released as the third single from the album on 21 November 2005, peaking\nat #6 in the UK. An early version entitled \"I Need a Gun\" was included on\nDamon Albarn's album Democrazy. On 8 December 2005, \"Dirty Harry\" was\nnominated for a Grammy under the category \"Urban/Alternative Performance\", but\nwas beaten by Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley's \"Welcome to Jamrock\".\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video was first released on 25 October 2005, sent to those on the e-mail\nlist on Gorillaz' official website. A thematic follow-up to the band's \"Clint\nEastwood\", it refers to the film of the same name, Clint Eastwood being the\nlead actor in the movie. \"Dirty Harry\" is one of the few Gorillaz music videos\nshot on location, the others being \"Stylo\", \"DoYaThing\", \"Strobelite\", and\n\"Humility\". Initially, the group intended to utilise a computer animated\ndesert as background, but discovered that simply flying to a real desert was\neasier and cheaper. The video was shot in the Swakopmund Desert in Namibia; it\nmainly features shirtless 2-D and an animated version of the San Fernando\nValley Youth Chorus stranded there, following what appears to have been a\nhelicopter crash. The survivors keep themselves entertained with the song\nwhile awaiting the arrival of rescuers, portrayed by Noodle and Murdoc crewing\na Windhoeker Maschinenfabrik Wer\u2019wolf MKII mine-proof vehicle driven by Russel\n(who wears a Fu Manchu). Both song and video feature a guest appearance by\nPharcyde rapper Bootie Brown, who leaps out of a sand dune in military\nfatigues to perform his verse of the song. The video concludes with Gorillaz,\nthe children and Bootie Brown departing the crash site in the Werwolf, which\nbreaks down a short distance away.\n\n## Track listing\n\nUK CD1 / Digital Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"All Alone\" (Live) \u2013 3:39\n\nUK CD2 / Digital E.P.\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n\nUK DVD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Murdoc Is God\" \u2013 2:26\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Animatic) \u2013 3:47\n\nEuropean / Australian CD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Animatic) \u2013 3:47\n\nJapanese CD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"All Alone\" (Live) \u2013 3:39\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n\nUS Digital EP\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Highway (Under Construction)\" \u2013 4:20\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Live in Harlem - Video) \u2013 6:12\n\nUK 12\" vinyl\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Jon Carter remix) \u2013 5:58\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n\nAustralian promo CD single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Paul Mac remix) (edit) \u2013 3:28\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Paul Mac remix) (full-length) \u2013 5:11\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Damon Albarn: vocals, synthesizers, guitars, string arrangements\n  * Bootie Brown: rap\n  * Jason Cox: bass guitar, production\n  * Danger Mouse: sampled loops, percussion, drum programming, production\n  * The San Fernandez Youth Chorus: additional vocals\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Rolling Stone article\n  * MTV news article with confirmation\n\n"

      "# Royal Troon Golf Club\n\nRoyal Troon Golf Club is a links golf course in Scotland, located in Troon,\nSouth Ayrshire, southwest of Glasgow.\n\n## Founding and early years\n\nThe club, which now has a total of 45 holes, was founded in 1878, initially\nwith five holes. It lies adjacent to the Firth of Clyde. George Strath was\nappointed in 1881 as the club's first golf professional, and together with\n1882 Open champion Willie Fernie (golfer), designed the original course,\nexpanding it to 18 holes by 1888. The two were assisted by Charlie Hunter,\ngreenskeeper of the neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club, in Troon's formative\nyears. When Strath left the Club's employ in 1887, Fernie became head\nprofessional, and served in that role until his death in 1924. He laid out the\nclub's original Portland Course as well; this course was named in honour of\nthe 6th Duke of Portland, an essential early Troon Golf Club patron and\nfacilitator, who was one of the region's largest landowners. The Club's\nproperty lies between the Firth of Clyde on the west, a caravan park on the\nsouth (slightly further south lies Prestwick Golf Club), the railway line and\nmain road on the east, and the town of Troon on the north. Glasgow Prestwick\nAirport is located slightly to the south and east of the club, and low-flying\naircraft are nearest its southern section.\n\n## Redesigned for first Open Championship\n\nJust prior to Royal Troon hosting its first Open Championship in 1923, the Old\nCourse was redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid, a five-\ntime Open champion, one of the era's top architects, and a member of the World\nGolf Hall of Fame. Other than having new back tees on several holes, the\ncurrent Old Course is essentially very similar to Braid's finished work.\n\n## Awarded 'Royal' designation\n\nTroon was granted its \"Royal\" designation in 1978, during its centennial. Its\nclubhouse is richly decorated with historical golf artifacts. James\nMontgomerie, father of champion golfer Colin Montgomerie, served as Secretary\nin the 1980s.\n\n## Nine-time host of The Open Championship\n\nIts Old Course is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of\nthe major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The Club has hosted\nthe Open nine times, the most recent in 2016.\n\n## Past Open champions\n\nPast Open champions at Royal Troon include Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia,\nTom Watson, Tom Weiskopf, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Locke, and Arthur Havers. Six\nconsecutive Opens at Troon were won by Americans, from 1962 through 2004,\nended by Henrik Stenson of Sweden in 2016.\n\n## Noteworthy characteristics\n\n### Seaside opening\n\nThe Old Course begins alongside the sea, running southwards in a line for the\nfirst six holes. This opening section offers full visibility and plenty of\nspace, but does still require accuracy to avoid deep bunkers. Many good rounds\nhave been fashioned through low scores here, often aided by prevailing\ndownwind conditions.\n\n### Rise in complexity\n\nBeginning with the seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while\nsimultaneously changing direction, on each of its next six holes, among\nhillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely\npunish offline shots. This sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and\n11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes.\n\n### Long finish\n\nWith the 13th hole, the player turns northwards for a long, very stern finish,\nrunning parallel to the opening stretch. This comprises three long par 4s, two\ntough par 3s, and a challenging par 5 (the 16th) with its fairway bisected at\nthe halfway point by a ditch, which can only very rarely be carried from the\ntee. The player very often has to face a strong prevailing wind.\n\n### Famous holes\n\nRoyal Troon is home to both the longest and shortest holes in Open\nChampionship golf. Regarded as one of the top holes in the world, the par-3\n8th hole (\"Postage Stamp\") measures a scant , but its diminutive green\nmeasures a mere . Two holes earlier, the par-5 6th (\"Turnberry\") extends to a\nlengthy . The 11th hole (\"The Railway\") is one of the most difficult holes in\nmajor championship golf. Now a long par-4, a blind tee shot has a long carry\nover gorse with out of bounds all along the railway on the right. The lengthy\napproach shot is to a small green that falls away, with nearby out of bounds.\n\n## Votes to admit women as members\n\nOn 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into\nthe club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have\novershadowed the 2016 Open Championship, and potentially to the club being\nremoved from the Open rota in the future.\n\n## The Portland and Craigend Courses\n\nThe Old Course is the championship layout at Royal Troon. Its second course,\nthe Portland, also an 18-hole layout from 1895, but significantly shorter than\nthe Old Course, was redesigned in 1921 by world-renowned architect Dr. Alister\nMacKenzie, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The Portland is also of\nvery high standard. It is located slightly further inland and mostly further\nnorth than the Old Course, with no holes bordering the Firth of Clyde; it has\nits own clubhouse. The Craigend Course is a nine-hole par-3 course. The Club\nis private; guests are allowed at certain times, under advance booking, with a\nhandicap certificate establishing proficiency. The Old Course has four tees \u2013\n\"Ladies\", \"Short\", \"Medal\" and \"Championship\".\n\n## Layout\n\nFor 2016 Open Championship: Lengths of the course for previous Opens (since\n1950):\n\n  * 2004: , par 71\n  * 1997: , par 71\n  * 1989: , par 72\n  * 1982: , par 72\n\n  * 1973: , par 72\n  * 1962: , par 72\n  * 1950: , par 70\n\nOpens from 1962 through 1989 played the 11th hole as a par-5.\n\n## The Open Championship\n\nThe Open Championship has been held at Troon on nine occasions:\n\n  * Note: For multiple winners of The Open Championship, superscript ordinal identifies which in their respective careers.\n\n## Women's British Open\n\nThe Women's British Open has been held at Troon on one occasion:\n\n## Hosts further significant events\n\n  * Royal Troon has hosted the Amateur Championship on five occasions: 1956, 1968, 1978, 2003, and 2012.\n  * The Club hosted the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship on four occasions: 1904, 1925, 1952, and 1984.\n  * The Club hosted the Senior Open Championship in 2008, and American Bruce Vaughan won.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Amateur on six occasions: 1923, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1977 and 2009.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Ladies' Amateur on five occasions: 1907, 1949, 1957, 1963, and 1982.\n  * The Club is schedule to host the AIG Women's British Open in 2020.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * The Open Championship \u2013 official site\n\n"

Glasgow Prestwick\nAirport is located slightly to the south and east of the club, and low-flying\naircraft are nearest its southern section.\n\n## Redesigned for first Open Championship\n\nJust prior to Royal Troon hosting its first Open Championship in 1923, the Old\nCourse was redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid, a five-\ntime Open champion, one of the era's top architects, and a member of the World\nGolf Hall of Fame. Other than having new back tees on several holes, the\ncurrent Old Course is essentially very similar to Braid's finished work.\n\n## Awarded 'Royal' designation\n\nTroon was granted its \"Royal\" designation in 1978, during its centennial. Its\nclubhouse is richly decorated with historical golf artifacts. James\nMontgomerie, father of champion golfer Colin Montgomerie, served as Secretary\nin the 1980s.\n\n## Nine-time host of The Open Championship\n\nIts Old Course is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of\nthe major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The Club has hosted\nthe Open nine times, the most recent in 2016.\n\n## Past Open champions\n\nPast Open champions at Royal Troon include Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia,\nTom Watson, Tom Weiskopf, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Locke, and Arthur Havers. Six\nconsecutive Opens at Troon were won by Americans, from 1962 through 2004,\nended by Henrik Stenson of Sweden in 2016.\n\n## Noteworthy characteristics\n\n### Seaside opening\n\nThe Old Course begins alongside the sea, running southwards in a line for the\nfirst six holes. This opening section offers full visibility and plenty of\nspace, but does still require accuracy to avoid deep bunkers. Many good rounds\nhave been fashioned through low scores here, often aided by prevailing\ndownwind conditions.\n\n### Rise in complexity\n\nBeginning with the seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while\nsimultaneously changing direction, on each of its next six holes, among\nhillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely\npunish offline shots. This sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and\n11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes.\n\n### Long finish\n\nWith the 13th hole, the player turns northwards for a long, very stern finish,\nrunning parallel to the opening stretch. This comprises three long par 4s, two\ntough par 3s, and a challenging par 5 (the 16th) with its fairway bisected at\nthe halfway point by a ditch, which can only very rarely be carried from the\ntee. The player very often has to face a strong prevailing wind.\n\n### Famous holes\n\nRoyal Troon is home to both the longest and shortest holes in Open\nChampionship golf. Regarded as one of the top holes in the world, the par-3\n8th hole (\"Postage Stamp\") measures a scant , but its diminutive green\nmeasures a mere . Two holes earlier, the par-5 6th (\"Turnberry\") extends to a\nlengthy . The 11th hole (\"The Railway\") is one of the most difficult holes in\nmajor championship golf. Now a long par-4, a blind tee shot has a long carry\nover gorse with out of bounds all along the railway on the right. The lengthy\napproach shot is to a small green that falls away, with nearby out of bounds.\n\n## Votes to admit women as members\n\nOn 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into\nthe club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have\novershadowed the 2016 Open Championship, and potentially to the club being\nremoved from the Open rota in the future.\n\n## The Portland and Craigend Courses\n\nThe Old Course is the championship layout at Royal Troon. Its second course,\nthe Portland, also an 18-hole layout from 1895, but significantly shorter than\nthe Old Course, was redesigned in 1921 by world-renowned architect Dr. Alister\nMacKenzie, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The Portland is also of\nvery high standard. It is located slightly further inland and mostly further\nnorth than the Old Course, with no holes bordering the Firth of Clyde; it has\nits own clubhouse. The Craigend Course is a nine-hole par-3 course. The Club\nis private; guests are allowed at certain times, under advance booking, with a\nhandicap certificate establishing proficiency. The Old Course has four tees \u2013\n\"Ladies\", \"Short\", \"Medal\" and \"Championship\".\n\n## Layout\n\nFor 2016 Open Championship: Lengths of the course for previous Opens (since\n1950):\n\n  * 2004: , par 71\n  * 1997: , par 71\n  * 1989: , par 72\n  * 1982: , par 72\n\n  * 1973: , par 72\n  * 1962: , par 72\n  * 1950: , par 70\n\nOpens from 1962 through 1989 played the 11th hole as a par-5.\n\n## The Open Championship\n\nThe Open Championship has been held at Troon on nine occasions:\n\n  * Note: For multiple winners of The Open Championship, superscript ordinal identifies which in their respective careers.\n\n## Women's British Open\n\nThe Women's British Open has been held at Troon on one occasion:\n\n## Hosts further significant events\n\n  * Royal Troon has hosted the Amateur Championship on five occasions: 1956, 1968, 1978, 2003, and 2012.\n  * The Club hosted the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship on four occasions: 1904, 1925, 1952, and 1984.\n  * The Club hosted the Senior Open Championship in 2008, and American Bruce Vaughan won.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Amateur on six occasions: 1923, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1977 and 2009.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Ladies' Amateur on five occasions: 1907, 1949, 1957, 1963, and 1982.\n  * The Club is schedule to host the AIG Women's British Open in 2020.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * The Open Championship \u2013 official site\n\n"

      "# Ms. Pac-Man\n\nGeneral Computer originally made the game as a modification kit for the\noriginal Pac-Man, titled Crazy Otto. Following legal action with Atari, GCC\nwas forced to present the project to Midway Games, the North American\ndistributor of Pac-Man, before release, who purchased the project. Multiple\nnames were made for the game, including Super Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man and Mrs.\nPac-Man, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. Namco\npresident Masaya Nakamura helped design the character of Ms. Pac-Man, and\ncollected royalties for each arcade cabinet sold. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by\ncritics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist,\nsome labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest\nvideo games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games\never made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and\nhandheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms.\nPac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor\ncompany, Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by\neating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to\nlose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the monsters to\nturn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be\neaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase,\nthe speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the\nmonsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n### Differences from the original Pac-Man\n\n  * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.\n  * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.\n  * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.\n  * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.\n  * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.\n  * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.\n  * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \"she dramatically swoons and falls\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.\n  * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the attract opening sequence for Jr. Pac-Man.\n  * The sound effects and music are all new.\n\n### Fruit point values\n\nAfter level 7, any fruit will appear, although its point value will be the\nsame (unlike in Pac-Man, in which the Key will always be the fruit after level\n13).\n\n## History\n\nMs. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called\nCrazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer\nCorporation (GCC). While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a\nlawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile\nAttack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion\nkits without consent from the original game manufacturer. Rather than\nscrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed\ngame to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become\nimpatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would\nbe Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their\nattention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco\nto prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and\ncharacters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game\nelements were altered to better reflect the Pac-Man series. The game was\ninitially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character.\nInspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female\ncounterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-\nWoman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then\nrealized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby\nto Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their\nrelationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac-Man, and then\nfinally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve\nGolson said \"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super\nPac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all\noccurred within 72 hours of actual production. According to one 1982 estimate,\na majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki\nof Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original\nPac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of\nwomen as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders\nwho have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\" The game was later awarded the\nCertificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982\nArcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular,\nMidway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer\nList of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent,\ncausing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-\nMan was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that\neventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and\nMidway. GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was\nmanufactured without Namco's blessing. Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at\nthat time, helped design the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae\nsaid, \"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the\nPresident of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept,\nget rid of the hair.' Ms. Pac-Man lost her hair\u2013it was actually Pac-Woman at\nthe time, I believe. The beauty mark stayed, and the lips stayed. I think we\nadded a bow, and were quickly done with it, so Ms. Pac-Man had been created.\"\nHowever, Macrae also said, \"At the same time, there was a little bit of\nembarrassment, I believe, in-house in Japan, of the fact that the sequel was\nbeing done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement\nthat Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms.\nPac-Man, being the same as what they got on Pac-Man, and Midway could choose\nto do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\"\n\n## Ports\n\nAtari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and\nAtari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX\nSpectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the\nAtarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all\nfour intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was\npublished to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \"A decent adaptation overall,\nand a good game in its own right.\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man\ngames, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the\narcades, you'll love her here, too.\"\n\n## Intellectual rights\n\nThe GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway Games in 1982, as\nat the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from\nNamco. In the years since, the Ms. Pac-Man license fell back to Namco (now\nBandai Namco) after Midway went bankrupt in 2010. Around 2019, AtGames, a\ncompany that specializes in microconsoles feature retro arcade hits, had\napproached the GCC group members about licensing Ms. Pac-Man. AtGames had\nlearned that while some of the ongoing royalties for the Ms. Pac-Man were\nbeing met by Bandai Namco, they were not meeting all the terms. Bandai Namco,\non learning that AtGames has been seeking these rights for a possible mini-\narcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames, declaring that AtGames was\nviolating Bandai Namco's control of the license.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that the Genesis version of Ms.\nPac-Man, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling\nGenesis games. The same year, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as\nnumber 12 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying that it has aged far\nbetter than the original Pac-Man due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes,\nmoving fruits, and intermissions. They added, \"It has the broadest appeal of\nany game Next Generation has seen, with the possible exception of Tetris.\nWomen love it. Men Love it. Children love it.\" In 2009, Game Informer put Ms.\nPac-Man 10th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it\n\"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\". This is down one rank\nfrom Game Informers previous best games of all-time list. Entertainment Weekly\ncalled Ms. Pac-Man one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In\n2016, Ms. Pac-Man placed 5th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time\nlist.\n\n### Re-releases\n\n  * In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man included in a CD-i Arcade Classics collection (released in Europe, but not in North America). It had all of the extra features of Tengen's ports even though neither Tengen nor Williams Electronics had made this version.\n  * It is included in Namco's, Microsoft's and Atari's late 1990s series of classic game anthologies, and is an unlockable minigame in the SNES version of and in Pac-Man World 2.\n  * A standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. Ms. Pac-Man and four other games (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious and Pole Position) are included in a self-contained joystick hand controller.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was also a free game bundled with every Xbox Live Arcade disc for the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 XBLA version was released on January 9, 2007, featuring an online leaderboard and twelve achievements.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was later released on Namco Museum Volume 3; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all Namco Museum releases).\n  * As of July 11, 2008, Ms. Pac Man is available for Apple's iPhone through the App Store. The game was also released in July for Windows Mobile.\n  * As part of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, Ms. Pac-Man is one of the games included on the home version of Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine.\n  * It was included as downloadable content in Pac-Man Museum for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Ms. Pac-Man at the Arcade History database\n  * Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 at Atari Mania\n  * GCC 2004 reunion audio Presentation by GCC alumni of their company history, including development of Ms. Pac-Man\n  * Twin Galaxies has a scoreboard for Ms. Pac-Man high scores (registration required)\n\n"

The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was\npublished to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \"A decent adaptation overall,\nand a good game in its own right.\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man\ngames, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the\narcades, you'll love her here, too.\"\n\n## Intellectual rights\n\nThe GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway Games in 1982, as\nat the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from\nNamco. In the years since, the Ms. Pac-Man license fell back to Namco (now\nBandai Namco) after Midway went bankrupt in 2010. Around 2019, AtGames, a\ncompany that specializes in microconsoles feature retro arcade hits, had\napproached the GCC group members about licensing Ms. Pac-Man. AtGames had\nlearned that while some of the ongoing royalties for the Ms. Pac-Man were\nbeing met by Bandai Namco, they were not meeting all the terms. Bandai Namco,\non learning that AtGames has been seeking these rights for a possible mini-\narcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames, declaring that AtGames was\nviolating Bandai Namco's control of the license.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that the Genesis version of Ms.\nPac-Man, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling\nGenesis games. The same year, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as\nnumber 12 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying that it has aged far\nbetter than the original Pac-Man due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes,\nmoving fruits, and intermissions. They added, \"It has the broadest appeal of\nany game Next Generation has seen, with the possible exception of Tetris.\nWomen love it. Men Love it. Children love it.\" In 2009, Game Informer put Ms.\nPac-Man 10th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it\n\"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\". This is down one rank\nfrom Game Informers previous best games of all-time list. Entertainment Weekly\ncalled Ms. Pac-Man one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In\n2016, Ms. Pac-Man placed 5th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time\nlist.\n\n### Re-releases\n\n  * In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man included in a CD-i Arcade Classics collection (released in Europe, but not in North America). It had all of the extra features of Tengen's ports even though neither Tengen nor Williams Electronics had made this version.\n  * It is included in Namco's, Microsoft's and Atari's late 1990s series of classic game anthologies, and is an unlockable minigame in the SNES version of and in Pac-Man World 2.\n  * A standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. Ms. Pac-Man and four other games (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious and Pole Position) are included in a self-contained joystick hand controller.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was also a free game bundled with every Xbox Live Arcade disc for the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 XBLA version was released on January 9, 2007, featuring an online leaderboard and twelve achievements.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was later released on Namco Museum Volume 3; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all Namco Museum releases).\n  * As of July 11, 2008, Ms. Pac Man is available for Apple's iPhone through the App Store. The game was also released in July for Windows Mobile.\n  * As part of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, Ms. Pac-Man is one of the games included on the home version of Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine.\n  * It was included as downloadable content in Pac-Man Museum for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Ms. Pac-Man at the Arcade History database\n  * Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 at Atari Mania\n  * GCC 2004 reunion audio Presentation by GCC alumni of their company history, including development of Ms. Pac-Man\n  * Twin Galaxies has a scoreboard for Ms. Pac-Man high scores (registration required)\n\n"

      "# World Blitz Chess Championship\n\nThe World Blitz Chess Championship is a chess tournament held to determine the\nworld champion in chess played under blitz time controls. Since 2012, FIDE has\nheld an annual joint rapid and blitz chess tournament and billed it as the\nWorld Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. The current world blitz champion is\nMagnus Carlsen who is also classical and rapid champion.\n\n## Time controls\n\nStarting in the early 1900s, chess clubs began to organize tournament played\nat accelerated time controls; these early games usually required a set number\nof moves from each player within a certain time interval. One of the earliest\nexamples was the local chess club at Hastings, England, where 10 seconds were\nallowed per-move during a blitz tournament held after the 1904 British Chess\nChampionship. By 1950, the time controls had changed to the familiar five\nminutes per player, hence the \"five-minute game\" moniker; the term \"blitz\nchess\" would not be coined until the 1960s.\n\n## FIDE-recognized events\n\n### FIDE World Blitz Championship (2006\u20132010)\n\nThe first blitz chess tournament to be recognized by FIDE as a \"world\nchampionship\" took place on 6 September 2006 in Rishon Lezion, Israel.\nStructured as a 16-player round-robin, the tournament featured seven of the\nworld's top 20 Grandmasters, as well as a young Magnus Carlsen. After 15\nrounds, Alexander Grischuk and Peter Svidler finished atop the leaderboard\nwith 10\u00bd/15; Grischuk subsequently defeated Svidler with Black in an\narmageddon game to win the championship. The following year, the tournament\n(now branded as the FIDE World Blitz Cup) was held in Moscow, Russia following\nthe Tal Memorial tournament and was re-structured as a 20-player double-round\nrobin with a significantly stronger field. After Ukrainian grandmaster Vassily\nIvanchuk and Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand entered the final round tied\non points, Ivanchuk defeated Anand from a disadvantaged position to win the\ntournament with 25\u00bd/38. In 2008, the championship reverted to a 16-player\nround robin. Despite a late charge from the defending champion Ivanchuk, who\nwon seven of the final eight rounds, the tournament was won by Leinier\nDom\u00ednguez, a 25-year-old GM from Cuba who scored 11\u00bd/15 to edge out Ivanchuk\nby a half-point. In 2009, the championship returned to Moscow, where the\nformat was once again switched to a 22-player double round-robin with revised\ntime controls of three minutes per player plus a 2-second increment. The event\nwas won by the young Norwegian chess prodigy Magnus Carlsen, who finished\nthree points clear of the field with 31/42 and went 8/8 against the 2nd\nthrough 5th-place finishers. 2010 would prove to be the final year of the\nevent \u2013 hosted again in Moscow, the tournament was dubbed the VI World Blitz\n2010 and held immediately after the Tal Memorial tournament. Despite losing\nboth his final games, Armenian Grandmaster Levon Aronian was able to clinch\nthe title with 24\u00bd/38, half a point ahead of Teimour Radjabov. In November\n2010, a nine-round Swiss tournament was scheduled for February 17, 2011, to\nserve as a qualifying event for the World Blitz Championship 2011; however,\nafter no bids for the event were made the tournament was eventually cancelled.\n\n#### Editions and medallists\n\n### World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships (since 2012)\n\nOn May 31, 2012, FIDE announced the inaugural World Rapid & Blitz\nChampionships, set to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from July 1 to 11. The\n2012 tournament consisted of a qualifying round, followed by the rapid and\nblitz events held consecutively over five days. The championship was\noriginally structured as a 16-player round-robin tournament, set to coincide\nwith the first release of FIDE's rapid and blitz ratings in July 2012; invited\nwere the top 9 players in the FIDE ratings list, the defending champion Levon\nAronian, the three medalists of the qualification competition, and three wild-\ncard nominees by the organization committee and FIDE. The event has since been\nchanged to a Swiss tournament with a field of over 100 grandmasters. The top\nthree finishers in the standings are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals\nrespectively; tiebreaks are determined by the average rating of opponents.\n\n#### Editions and medallists\n\nOpen\n\nWomen\n\n## Other events\n\n### Herceg Novi Blitz Tournament of 1970\n\nOn 8 April 1970, following the USSR vs. Rest of the World 'Match of the\nCentury' hosted in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, a blitz tournament was held in Herceg\nNovi, featuring many of the same participants from the match. The event was a\n12-player double round-robin, with no tiebreaks and five minutes per player.\nFeaturing four World Champions, the field was considered the strongest of any\nblitz tournament in modern history. Heading into the event, two-time World\nChampion Tigran Petrosian was considered the favorite to win the event, with\nMikhail Tal and Viktor Korchnoi also enjoying favorable chances. It was\nAmerican grandmaster Bobby Fischer, however, who put up a dominant\nperformance, scoring 19/22 to win the tournament by 4\u00bd points. Fischer scored\na staggering 8\u00bd/10 against the five Soviet grandmasters in attendance,\ndropping only one game in the entire tournament and frequently gaining huge\ntime advantages in each game. According to one report, Fischer spent no more\nthan 2.5 minutes on any game. At the end of the tournament, Tal \u2013 who had been\nwhitewashed by Fischer \u2013 gave his thoughts on the American's performance.\n\n### 1988 World Blitz Championship\n\nFollowing the Candidates' matches for the 1988 cycle, a World Blitz\nChampionship was hosted in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, on 19 February\n1988. The event was a 32-player single-elimination tournament, with pairings\ndetermined by best-of-four matches. The field was headlined by long-time\nrivals Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, with the former considered the\nfavorite to win the tournament. Notable participants included:\n\n  1. , 2750\n  2. , 2715\n  3. , 2630\n  4. , 2625\n  5. , 2625\n  6. , 2620\n  7. , 2595\n  8. , 2595\n  9. , 2595\n  10. , 2585\n  11. , 2580\n  12. , 2560\n  13. , 2560\n  14. , 2550\n  15. , 2540\n  16. , 2535\n  17. , 2530\n  18. , 2525\n  19. , 2510\n  20. , 2505\n  21. , 2505\n  22. , 2495\n  23. , 2495\n  24. , 2480 \nFormer world champion Anatoly Karpov fell out of contention for the\nchampionship in just the second round, after dropping his first two games\nagainst fellow Soviet grandmaster Alexander Chernin. Reigning world champion\nGarry Kasparov steamed ahead into the quarterfinals but lost momentum after\nmissing an elementary mate in two against Bulgarian grandmaster Kiril\nGeorgiev; a stunned Kasparov was subsequently knocked out of the tournament.\nIn the final, Mikhail Tal clinched the championship with a 3\u00bd-\u00bd victory over\nArmenian grandmaster Rafael Vaganian. Mikhail Tal, the 51-year-old former\nWorld Champion, breezed through the final rounds with 5\u00bd/6 after dropping his\nfirst quarterfinal game. Joining him in the finals was Rafael Vaganian, who\nsurvived a controversial semifinal against Kiril Georgiev; the Armenian nearly\npunched his clock after making an illegal move in Game 2, an accusation that\nwas eventually refuted after match officials resorted to a video review and\nfound that Vaganian's hand had stopped just short of touching the clock. The\nfinal was a one-sided affair, with Tal repeatedly utilizing exchange\nsacrifices to find winning combinations; down 3\u20130 after three games, Vaganian\noffered his hand in the 4th game to concede the match to Tal. After the match,\nTal claimed he took the event \"none too seriously\"; he chain-smoked throughout\nthe tournament, and his \"preparation\" for the semifinal match against Chernin\nreportedly consisted of a double scotch.\n\n### 2000 World Blitz Chess Cup\n\nThe Plus GSM World Blitz Cup was a 367-player Swiss-system tournament held in\nWarsaw, Poland, on 9 January 2000. Hosted at the Warsaw Polonia Chess Club,\nthe event consisted of 11 rounds, with each match comprising two 5-minute\ngames for a total of 22 games per player. Indian grandmaster Vishwanathan\nAnand, the tournament's No. 1 seed, triumphed over a strong field that\nincluded 70 Grandmasters and nine of the world's top-20 ranked players with a\n17\u00bd/22 score. Anand's run saw him pick up 14 wins, 7 draws, and only 1 loss,\nhighlighted by a 43-move win with the black pieces against Anatoly Karpov. The\ntournament's sponsor, Plus GSM, set aside a $30,500 prize fund for the event\nas well as Nokia mobile communicators to be given to the top four finishers\nand the two top Polish players.\n\n## See also\n\n  * World Rapid Chess Championship\n  * Fast chess\n\n## References\n\n"

In October 2011 she took the second place at the\nNalchik stage of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2011\u201312 with 7/11, ranked only\nafter her compatriot Zhao Xue; her performance was enough to acquire her third\nand final norm required for the Grandmaster title. However, one of the three\nnorms was missing the signature of the arbiter, disqualifying her for\nconsideration for the title. From June 18 to July 2, 2014 in the 5th stage of\nthe FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2013\u201314 held in Lopota, Georgia she finished\njointly second with Elina Danielian and a 7/11 score.

      "# Chess World Cup 2019\n\nThe Chess World Cup 2019 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament\nthat took place in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, from 9 September to 4 October\n2019. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. Radjabov and the\nrunner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the\nWorld Chess Championship 2020. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nLevon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the\nquarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave on tiebreaks.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Teimour Radjabov in the semi-finals.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Yu Yangyi, to claim 3rd place. This tournament\nalso saw Jeffery Xiong (31st seed) progress far, being knocked out in the\nquarter finals to the ultimate champion/winner Teimour Radjabov.\n\n## Bidding process\n\nThere was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad\nevents, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation.\n\n## Format\n\nThe tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round\n6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40\nmoves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30\nseconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of\nfour classical games. If the score is tied after the classical games, rapid\nand, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are\nplayed with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment.\nIn the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10\nminutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two\nblitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied\n4\u20134 after all these games, a single \"Armageddon\" game is played: the player\nwho wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per\ngame and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting\nfrom move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black\nadvances if they win or the game is drawn. The two top finishers qualified for\nthe 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be\nthe top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because\nCarlsen as World Champion does not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had\nalready qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the\nWorld Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the\nprevious edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana\nboth declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply\nthe two finalists.\n\n## Schedule\n\nEach of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular\ntime limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final\nround has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for\ntiebreaks, if required.\n\n  * Round 1: 10 September \u2013 12 September\n  * Round 2: 13 September \u2013 15 September\n  * Round 3: 16 September \u2013 18 September\n  * Rest day: 19 September\n  * Round 4: 20 September \u2013 22 September\n  * Round 5: 23 September \u2013 25 September\n  * Round 6: 26 September \u2013 28 September\n  * Rest day: 29 September\n  * Final and play-off for third place: 30 September \u2013 4 October\n\n## Prize money\n\nThe total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000.\n\n## Participants\n\nThe participants were seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2019.

      "# World Women's Snooker Championship\n\nThe World Women's Snooker Championship (formerly known as the Women's World\nOpen Championship from 1976 to 1981 and the World Ladies Snooker Championship\nfrom 1983 to 2018) is the leading tournament on the World Women's Snooker\nTour. The reigning champion is Reanne Evans.\n\n## History\n\nThe tournament began as the Women's World Open Championship, which, as the\nmost prestigious event for female players, was effectively the world\nchampionship. The first tournament was held in 1976, and the event was held\nagain in 1980 and 1981. The competition was staged from 1983 onward as the\nWorld Ladies Snooker Championship. Over the next two decades, the tournament\nwas dominated by Allison Fisher (7 titles), Karen Corr (3 titles), and Kelly\nFisher (5 titles), all of whom eventually moved to the United States to\ncompete on the WPBA nine-ball pool tour. From 1998 to 2003, Embassy sponsored\nthe tournament, with the semi-finals and final taking place at the Crucible\nTheatre in Sheffield during the World Snooker Championship. After restrictions\non tobacco advertising were introduced in 2003, the tournament lost its\nsponsorship and was not held in 2004. The event was revived in 2005.

      "# List of NFL champions (1920\u20131969)\n\nThe National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the\nNational Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970,\nwere determined by two different systems. The National Football League was\nestablished on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football\nAssociation (APFA). The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football\nLeague, which it has retained ever since. From 1921 to 1931, the APFA/NFL\ndetermined its champion by overall win\u2013loss record, with no playoff games;\nties were not counted in the winning percentage total. The APFA did not keep\nrecords of the 1920 season; they declared the Akron Pros, who finished the\nseason with an 8\u20130\u20133 (8 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties) record, as the league's first\nchampions by a vote of the owners. The Canton Bulldogs won two straight\nchampionships from 1922 to 1923, and the Green Bay Packers won three in a row\nfrom 1929 to 1931. The 1932 NFL season resulted in a tie for first place\nbetween the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, and could not be resolved\nby the typical win\u2013loss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played;\nChicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split\ninto two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL\nChampionship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge,\neffective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion\nfrom 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship\nGame in each of the four seasons before the completed merger. The NFL\nChampionship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC\nChampionship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC\nChampionship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion. The Green\nBay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning 11 of\nthe 50 championships. The Packers were also the only team to win three\nstraight championships, an achievement they accomplished twice: 1929\u201331 and\n1965\u201367. The Chicago Bears won a total of eight titles, and the Cleveland\nBrowns, Detroit Lions, and New York Giants each won four. The Bears recorded\nthe largest victory in a championship game, defeating the Washington Redskins\n73\u20130 in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; six other title games ended in a\nshutout as well. The Philadelphia Eagles recorded two consecutive shutouts in\n1948 and 1949. New York City hosted the most championship games (eight), while\nthe highest-attended title game was the 1955 NFL Championship Game, where\n85,693 fans showed up in Los Angeles to watch the Browns beat the Rams 38\u201314.\n\n## APFA/NFL champions (1920\u20131932)\n\nChampion determined by win\u2013loss percentage.

      "# World Blitz Chess Championship\n\nThe World Blitz Chess Championship is a chess tournament held to determine the\nworld champion in chess played under blitz time controls. Since 2012, FIDE has\nheld an annual joint rapid and blitz chess tournament and billed it as the\nWorld Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. The current world blitz champion is\nMagnus Carlsen who is also classical and rapid champion.\n\n## Time controls\n\nStarting in the early 1900s, chess clubs began to organize tournament played\nat accelerated time controls; these early games usually required a set number\nof moves from each player within a certain time interval. One of the earliest\nexamples was the local chess club at Hastings, England, where 10 seconds were\nallowed per-move during a blitz tournament held after the 1904 British Chess\nChampionship. By 1950, the time controls had changed to the familiar five\nminutes per player, hence the \"five-minute game\" moniker; the term \"blitz\nchess\" would not be coined until the 1960s.\n\n## FIDE-recognized events\n\n### FIDE World Blitz Championship (2006\u20132010)\n\nThe first blitz chess tournament to be recognized by FIDE as a \"world\nchampionship\" took place on 6 September 2006 in Rishon Lezion, Israel.\nStructured as a 16-player round-robin, the tournament featured seven of the\nworld's top 20 Grandmasters, as well as a young Magnus Carlsen. After 15\nrounds, Alexander Grischuk and Peter Svidler finished atop the leaderboard\nwith 10\u00bd/15; Grischuk subsequently defeated Svidler with Black in an\narmageddon game to win the championship. The following year, the tournament\n(now branded as the FIDE World Blitz Cup) was held in Moscow, Russia following\nthe Tal Memorial tournament and was re-structured as a 20-player double-round\nrobin with a significantly stronger field. After Ukrainian grandmaster Vassily\nIvanchuk and Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand entered the final round tied\non points, Ivanchuk defeated Anand from a disadvantaged position to win the\ntournament with 25\u00bd/38. In 2008, the championship reverted to a 16-player\nround robin. Despite a late charge from the defending champion Ivanchuk, who\nwon seven of the final eight rounds, the tournament was won by Leinier\nDom\u00ednguez, a 25-year-old GM from Cuba who scored 11\u00bd/15 to edge out Ivanchuk\nby a half-point. In 2009, the championship returned to Moscow, where the\nformat was once again switched to a 22-player double round-robin with revised\ntime controls of three minutes per player plus a 2-second increment. The event\nwas won by the young Norwegian chess prodigy Magnus Carlsen, who finished\nthree points clear of the field with 31/42 and went 8/8 against the 2nd\nthrough 5th-place finishers. 2010 would prove to be the final year of the\nevent \u2013 hosted again in Moscow, the tournament was dubbed the VI World Blitz\n2010 and held immediately after the Tal Memorial tournament. Despite losing\nboth his final games, Armenian Grandmaster Levon Aronian was able to clinch\nthe title with 24\u00bd/38, half a point ahead of Teimour Radjabov. In November\n2010, a nine-round Swiss tournament was scheduled for February 17, 2011, to\nserve as a qualifying event for the World Blitz Championship 2011; however,\nafter no bids for the event were made the tournament was eventually cancelled.\n\n#### Editions and medallists\n\n### World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships (since 2012)\n\nOn May 31, 2012, FIDE announced the inaugural World Rapid & Blitz\nChampionships, set to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from July 1 to 11. The\n2012 tournament consisted of a qualifying round, followed by the rapid and\nblitz events held consecutively over five days. The championship was\noriginally structured as a 16-player round-robin tournament, set to coincide\nwith the first release of FIDE's rapid and blitz ratings in July 2012; invited\nwere the top 9 players in the FIDE ratings list, the defending champion Levon\nAronian, the three medalists of the qualification competition, and three wild-\ncard nominees by the organization committee and FIDE. The event has since been\nchanged to a Swiss tournament with a field of over 100 grandmasters. The top\nthree finishers in the standings are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals\nrespectively; tiebreaks are determined by the average rating of opponents.\n\n#### Editions and medallists\n\nOpen\n\nWomen\n\n## Other events\n\n### Herceg Novi Blitz Tournament of 1970\n\nOn 8 April 1970, following the USSR vs. Rest of the World 'Match of the\nCentury' hosted in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, a blitz tournament was held in Herceg\nNovi, featuring many of the same participants from the match. The event was a\n12-player double round-robin, with no tiebreaks and five minutes per player.\nFeaturing four World Champions, the field was considered the strongest of any\nblitz tournament in modern history. Heading into the event, two-time World\nChampion Tigran Petrosian was considered the favorite to win the event, with\nMikhail Tal and Viktor Korchnoi also enjoying favorable chances. It was\nAmerican grandmaster Bobby Fischer, however, who put up a dominant\nperformance, scoring 19/22 to win the tournament by 4\u00bd points. Fischer scored\na staggering 8\u00bd/10 against the five Soviet grandmasters in attendance,\ndropping only one game in the entire tournament and frequently gaining huge\ntime advantages in each game. According to one report, Fischer spent no more\nthan 2.5 minutes on any game. At the end of the tournament, Tal \u2013 who had been\nwhitewashed by Fischer \u2013 gave his thoughts on the American's performance.\n\n### 1988 World Blitz Championship\n\nFollowing the Candidates' matches for the 1988 cycle, a World Blitz\nChampionship was hosted in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, on 19 February\n1988. The event was a 32-player single-elimination tournament, with pairings\ndetermined by best-of-four matches. The field was headlined by long-time\nrivals Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, with the former considered the\nfavorite to win the tournament. Notable participants included:\n\n  1. , 2750\n  2. , 2715\n  3. , 2630\n  4. , 2625\n  5. , 2625\n  6. , 2620\n  7. , 2595\n  8. , 2595\n  9. , 2595\n  10. , 2585\n  11. , 2580\n  12. , 2560\n  13. , 2560\n  14. , 2550\n  15. , 2540\n  16. , 2535\n  17. , 2530\n  18. , 2525\n  19. , 2510\n  20. , 2505\n  21. , 2505\n  22. , 2495\n  23. , 2495\n  24. , 2480 \nFormer world champion Anatoly Karpov fell out of contention for the\nchampionship in just the second round, after dropping his first two games\nagainst fellow Soviet grandmaster Alexander Chernin. Reigning world champion\nGarry Kasparov steamed ahead into the quarterfinals but lost momentum after\nmissing an elementary mate in two against Bulgarian grandmaster Kiril\nGeorgiev; a stunned Kasparov was subsequently knocked out of the tournament.\nIn the final, Mikhail Tal clinched the championship with a 3\u00bd-\u00bd victory over\nArmenian grandmaster Rafael Vaganian. Mikhail Tal, the 51-year-old former\nWorld Champion, breezed through the final rounds with 5\u00bd/6 after dropping his\nfirst quarterfinal game. Joining him in the finals was Rafael Vaganian, who\nsurvived a controversial semifinal against Kiril Georgiev; the Armenian nearly\npunched his clock after making an illegal move in Game 2, an accusation that\nwas eventually refuted after match officials resorted to a video review and\nfound that Vaganian's hand had stopped just short of touching the clock. The\nfinal was a one-sided affair, with Tal repeatedly utilizing exchange\nsacrifices to find winning combinations; down 3\u20130 after three games, Vaganian\noffered his hand in the 4th game to concede the match to Tal. After the match,\nTal claimed he took the event \"none too seriously\"; he chain-smoked throughout\nthe tournament, and his \"preparation\" for the semifinal match against Chernin\nreportedly consisted of a double scotch.\n\n### 2000 World Blitz Chess Cup\n\nThe Plus GSM World Blitz Cup was a 367-player Swiss-system tournament held in\nWarsaw, Poland, on 9 January 2000. Hosted at the Warsaw Polonia Chess Club,\nthe event consisted of 11 rounds, with each match comprising two 5-minute\ngames for a total of 22 games per player. Indian grandmaster Vishwanathan\nAnand, the tournament's No. 1 seed, triumphed over a strong field that\nincluded 70 Grandmasters and nine of the world's top-20 ranked players with a\n17\u00bd/22 score. Anand's run saw him pick up 14 wins, 7 draws, and only 1 loss,\nhighlighted by a 43-move win with the black pieces against Anatoly Karpov. The\ntournament's sponsor, Plus GSM, set aside a $30,500 prize fund for the event\nas well as Nokia mobile communicators to be given to the top four finishers\nand the two top Polish players.\n\n## See also\n\n  * World Rapid Chess Championship\n  * Fast chess\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)\n\nThe Prisoners are fictional characters from the comic book series The Walking\nDead and the television series of the same name.\n\n## Appearances\n\n### Comic book series\n\nDuring Rick's coma, due to the news broadcasts, the inmates and guards had a\nbasic understanding of what was going on. Soon, many of the guards abandoned\nthe prison and the inmates to fend for themselves; at about the same time, a\nfew walkers had somehow gotten inside and began to kill the inmates. Several\nof the guards freed the inmates and joined together to fight their way out,\nresulting in heavy casualties. By the time Rick and his group discovered the\nprison, it was discovered that there were only four survivors left who were\nlocked up inside the cafeteria. The two groups come into conflict after one of\nthem, Thomas Richards, kills two of the survivors, Rachel and Susie Greene,\nHershel Greene's two youngest twin daughters. Dexter is falsely accused of the\ncrime due to him being the \"only\" prisoner who was arrested for murder (it is\nlater revealed that Thomas was arrested for murder as well and initially lied\nabout being arrested for committing tax fraud). Thomas also tries to kill\nAndrea who is left without an earlobe and two scars as well as Patricia. Rick\nsaves Andrea who beats Thomas brutally, and the second attempted murder on\nPatricia's life is stopped by a vengeful Maggie, who empties her entire\nfirearm magazine into Thomas. After Thomas is killed, Dexter and Andrew try to\nkick out Rick's group, resulting in walkers flooding the courtyard. During the\nstruggle, Rick shoots Dexter in the head, covering it up as friendly-fire, and\nAndrew surrenders, running outside the gates to die. Axel, the only prisoner\nto side with Rick, joins the group and later becomes a vital and trusted\nmember of the group until he is killed during the second assault on the Prison\nfrom Woodbury.\n\n### Television series\n\nThe prisoners debut in \"Sick\" where they witness Rick amputating the lower\nportion of Hershel's leg after he is bitten by walkers. Rick makes a deal with\nthe Prisoners to clear out a cell block for them in exchange for half of their\nfood. Tomas brutally Big Tiny after he is scratched by a walker, despite the\nlatter's pleas that he doesn't feel any effects. Tomas tries twice to\nassassinate Rick while clearing out the cells, so Rick kills Tomas with his\nmachete, and chases Andrew and locks him in a courtyard full of walkers. Rick,\nDaryl, and T-Dog hold Axel and Oscar at gunpoint; Axel begs for his life, but\nOscar refuses to beg. Rick's group shows mercy on them and allows them to stay\nin the prison, though he and Oscar are told to stay in another block. Oscar\nand Axel find it very disturbing to stay with their deceased inmates and begs\nRick to let them stay. T-Dog sympathizes with the prisoners and asks Rick to\nlet them join the group, but Rick is adamant about keeping to their earlier\ncompromise. Later, a horde of walkers is let into the prison courtyard,\nresulting in the deaths of T-Dog and Lori. When the prison's sirens sound off,\nOscar explains that the back-up generators are powering the alarms, and takes\nRick to shut them down. Andrew, who survived and is revealed to have let the\nwalkers loose and turned on the alarms, attacks Rick in the generator room.\nOscar kills Andrew, and Oscar and Axel are then allowed to stay with the\nothers. Axel and Oscar helps dig graves for those who died during the walker\nattack. Axel volunteers to go to Woodbury, but stays behind to protect the\nprison. Oscar instead decides to go. During his plan to rescue Glenn Rhee and\nMaggie Greene, members of Rick's group, Oscar is shot dead by a Woodbury\nsoldier. At the prison, Axel soon tries to win the favor of the group by\ntrying to stir up conversations and takes a liking to Beth and Carol, flirting\nwith them both. He is later shown saddened by Oscar's death. Axel, Hershel,\nand Beth, visit new arrivals Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben. He helps the\ngroup fortify the prison, and becomes friendly with Carol by telling her\nstories of his criminal past. He reveals that he was sentenced for trying to\nrob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the police did not believe him and\nfound his brother's gun and assumed it to be the real weapon and he was\nincarcerated. He is killed by The Governor by a shot to the head as part of a\nsurprise attack initiating his assault on the prison.\n\n## Casting and television series reception\n\nAndrew was portrayed by actor and rapper Markice Moore. He had originally\nauditioned for the pilot episode for the role of T-Dog, which went to IronE\nSingleton. Moore was later cast on season 3 as Andrew through his agency:\n\"Production was very hush hush about season 3 so I didn't even know I booked\nit officially until a week before shooting. I was elated; I couldn't believe\nit when my manager, Gail Tassell called to tell me the good news. I'm a huge\nfan of the show, it's my favorite show on TV, so yes it was a dream come\ntrue.\" Per Glen Mazzara, \"Andrew is really Tomas' right-hand man. These guys\nare really the ones who have been intimidating Axel and Oscar.\" Lew Temple was\nalso cast as Axel. He described him as a \"a gregarious Southern redneck-biker\ntype, who has big heart\" and \"a sense of compassion for his fellow man, but he\nis not as meek as he might appear, and though he has had to survive with four\nother hardened criminals, sans Oscar, this brave new world is something\nentirely different for him. He wants to associate and assimilate into the\ngroup of survivors, to the point of trying too hard to be accepted. He has a\nwry sense of humor and ironic quick wit. He will make you laugh and cry in the\nsame offering.\" Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that \"things\nbecome sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew\ninto a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick\ndoes not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a\ngrowing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter\nnoted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea\nof walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that\nthis decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of\nmurder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group\nand forced his own son to put down his mother\". Los Angeles Times columnist\nLaura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open\nthe lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you\nconsider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with\nvendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of Slant Magazine described\nthe episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a\nconspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of\ndisconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene\nends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a\nforeboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden\nstrike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how\nthe episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in\nthe show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode\n\"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking\nlengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan\nSepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it\nhelps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first\nplace. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who\nprobably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the\ngate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for Rolling Stone magazine that\nwhen Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar\nshoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers\nthat Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in\nthe series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I\nloved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people\nwith him! [...] Die Hard TWD fans will remember my character forever because\nof all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick! The fight scenes\nwere great! Especially in my death scene.\" Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club\nin his review of \"Sick\", joked of Oscar and Axel, \"I'm sure the remaining\nprisoners are completely harmless. They said they were harmless\u2014why would they\nlie?\" Showrunner Glen Mazzara commented that in \"Killer Within\", Axel and\nOscar want to be let into the group so they \"prove themselves, which is why\nOscar takes action and kills Andrew (Markice Moore), so that he can gain\naccess to the group. Throughout the entire season, it's a major theme: Who can\nRick let in? Not just into the prison, but let in emotionally.\" Los Angeles\nTimes columnist Laura Hudson observed tribalism as a trope in \"Killer Within\",\nwhich she ascribed to the reluctance of Maggie, Rick, and others in the group\nto allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. Hudson noted that these characters\nhad been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past\ncivilization for so long that they have reverted to \"traveling in a small,\ntightly knit group, hunting and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part\nof their it as a deadly threat.\" Zack Handlen commented in his review of \"Made\nto Suffer\" that \"Axel's enthusiasm for getting laid is sending off all kinds\nof creepy vibes, just the way he got real interested when he found out Beth\nwas 17 could be a bad sign. (His assumption that Carol was a lesbian was kind\nof funny, though.)\" Lew Temple found out about Axel's death about two weeks\nbefore the episode \"Home\" was filmed: \"[Glen Mazzara] had just come down to\nscreen the season 3 premiere episode for cast and crew on location. It was\ngreat! It was a lovely evening. We celebrated an amazing kick-off to a great\nnew season. And that particular night was the first time I had met Glen in\nperson. We had a really nice visit about what we were doing with Axel, and he\nwas so effusive and kind and lovely, saying \"I really dig how you're bringing\nAxel out, and the layers that are there. We can go in so many directions\nbecause you're keeping things close to the vest and we're not sure what he's\nabout.\" So I was fairly excited, and I got a call from his assistant the next\nday saying Glen wanted to speak with me, and I'm like oh, great!, assuming\nhe's going to want to speak more about character development. 15 to 20 seconds\ninto the conversation he says, \"Lew, this is really unfortunate but I've got\nto let you know that Axel is going to take a bullet to the head.\" Eric Goldman\nat IGN thought the death of Axel was a huge surprise. Phil Dyess-Nugent,\nwriting for The A.V. Club, commented that in his earlier appearances, \"Lew\nTemple managed to invest Axel with a certain mangy charm, and he really\nblossoms in this episode; when he's chatting up Carol and shining a little\nwhite-trash charm, I found myself thinking, \"Shit, I'm glad this guy's\naround,\" which is a thought I haven't had about Rick or Glenn or Maggie or\nHershel in living memory. Unfortunately, the show itself seems to share Rick's\ndistrust of letting in strangers.\"\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Remember Me (T.I. song)\n\n\"Remember Me\" was the planned first single from the re-release of T.I.'s sixth\nalbum, Paper Trail; however, the re-release was eventually shelved, although\nthe song would still be released digitally.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the UK, the song was released as a single and was taken from an EP,\nentitled Paper Trail: Case Closed. It features Mary J. Blige. The song was\nofficially released to urban radio the week of July 7, 2009. The main message\nof the song is remembrance. Its original title was \"Don't Forget.\" The song is\nabout T.I.'s jail sentence and how he wants people to remember him as he is\nnot going to be gone forever, including the verse \"By the time you hear this,\nI'd be half way home.\" It also talks about the hard times in his life and how\nhe does not give up. In the song T.I. mentions Martin Luther King and Malcolm\nX and how he is the modern day version of them. With no promotion the single\nsold over 80,000 downloads in its first week, and it debuted at No. 29 on the\nBillboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video was directed by Jessy Terrero, and follows on from the themes of the\nsong, showing prisoners being forgotten by their significant others while\nincarcerated. A trailer was posted on June 15, 2009, and the full video was\nreleased on July 13, 2009, and it was later released on iTunes on July 28. The\nbeginning of the video starts where Dead and Gone left off, with T.I. being\nled to a prison cell to begin a sentence. T.I. then appears inside of his\nhouse, but he cannot be seen by anyone else. He finds his wife and another man\ncelebrating after finding out T.I. was going to prison. Two other prisoners\nare featured in similar scenarios, where they appear outside of their homes\nbut cannot be seen. One inmate sees his girlfriend cheating on him in front of\nhis daughter, and another sees his girlfriend throw a letter he wrote to her\nin a trash can. The video ends with T.I. being released from prison.\n\n## Track listing\n\nDigital single\n\n## Chart Positions\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# O. Henry's Full House\n\nO. Henry's Full House is a 1952 American anthology film made by 20th Century\nFox, consisting of five films, each based on a story by O. Henry. The film was\nproduced by Andr\u00e9 Hakim and directed by five directors from five screenplays\nwith different authors. The music score was composed by Alfred Newman. The\nfilm is narrated by author John Steinbeck, who made his only on-camera\nappearance to introduce each story. Howard Hawks \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" was\nso poorly received that the studio removed it before the film opened widely.\n\n## The five stories\n\n### \"The Cop and the Anthem\"\n\nDirected by Henry Koster, from a screenplay by Lamar Trotti, it stars Charles\nLaughton, Marilyn Monroe and David Wayne. As winter approaches, a vagrant\ndecides it's time for his annual winter spell in prison. But no matter how\nhard he tries, he cannot get himself arrested.\n\n### \"The Clarion Call\"\n\nDirected by Henry Hathaway, from a screenplay by Richard L. Breen, it stars\nDale Robertson and Richard Widmark. Plot: A detective cannot arrest a murderer\nhe knows from his past due to his honor involving an outstanding financial\ndebt to the criminal. Once a newspaper offers a reward, after being mocked by\nthe criminal, the detective arrests the criminal and collects the reward to\nrepay the debt. This vignette reunited Henry Hathaway and Richard Widmark\nwho'd worked together on the noir classic Kiss of Death (1947). Widmark's\ncharacter in The Clarion Call, \"Johnny Kernan\", is actually a reprise of his\nOscar-nominated character \"Tommy Udo\" from Kiss of Death. Widmark's Udo/Kernan\ncharacter was inspired by his love of Batman comics' \"The Joker\". The Tommy\nUdo performance in turn influenced Frank Gorshin in preparation for his\n\"Riddler\" character on the Batman TV series in the 1960s.\n\n### \"The Last Leaf\"\n\nDirected by Jean Negulesco, from a screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, it\nstars Anne Baxter, Jean Peters, and Gregory Ratoff. The story is set in\nGreenwich Village during a pneumonia epidemic. An old artist saves the life of\na young artist, dying of pneumonia, by giving her the will to live.

      "# Inside Out (2011 film)\n\nInside Out is a 2011 crime film directed by Artie Mandelberg. The film\nfeatures professional wrestler Triple H (credited as Paul \"Triple H\"\nLevesque), Michael Rapaport, Parker Posey, Julie White, Michael Cudlitz and\nBruce Dern. The project was the cinematic feature film debut for director\nArtie Mandelberg. The film was released on September 9, 2011.\n\n## Plot\n\nA.J., an ex-con who served 13 years in Angola for manslaughter, returns home\nto New Orleans and fights to protect the woman he loves and her young daughter\nfrom his dangerous former best friend. In better times, AJ (Triple H) would\nhave done anything to protect his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), a two-\nbit gangster and the son of Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) -- the city's toughest crime\nboss. While A.J. is in prison, Jack marries Claire (Parker Posey), the love of\nAJ's life, and together they raise a daughter, Pepper (Juliette Goglia).\nPepper is A.J.'s daughter, a fact known to Jack, but Jack pretends to be her\nbiological father. The day Jack picks up AJ from prison, the short-fused thug\ngets an itchy trigger finger that could land his buddy right back behind bars.\nThe situation grows increasingly tense as Dr. Vic attempts to handle the\nsituation quietly as he comes under investigation by the Louisiana Tax Board\nagent Martha (Julie White) for dealing in untaxed cigarettes. When Jack flees\nand Dr. Vic decides that the only way to get the job done right is to do it\nhimself, A.J. realizes that Claire and Pepper are in mortal danger, and races\nto their rescue.\n\n## Cast\n\n## Reception\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. On the movie review\naggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Inside Out has a 25% approval rating based on\n12 reviews and on Metacritic has received a score of 28/100 based on 8\nreviews. Writing for The New York Times, Daniel M. Gold described the plot as\n\"a tangle of dithering storylines\" and Levesque's acting as \"inert\". The New\nYork Post's Lou Lumenick derided Inside Out as \"nonsensical, thickly plotted\ngumbo\" which he found to be unintentionally funnier than Levesque's other\nstarring role in the comedy film The Chaperone. However, Eric Hynes of The\nVillage Voice was more positive, praising the film as a \"meandering,\neccentric, downright adorable existential crime yarn\", while noting that\nLevesque's performance was closer to \"a steroidal Steven Seagal\" than \"Hackman\nor Cagney\".\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",
      "# Camera Obscura (San Francisco, California)\n\nThe Camera Obscura is a large-scale camera obscura, in the Lands End area of\nthe Outer Richmond District in western San Francisco, California. It is\nlocated near the Cliff House restaurant, perched on the headlands on the\ncliffs just north of Ocean Beach. The Camera and restaurant are currently\nowned by the National Park Service and are within the Golden Gate National\nRecreation Area. The Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of\nHistoric Places in 2001 and is within the NPS Sutro Historic District. It is\nwithin the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, since being acquired by the\nNational Park Service in 1977.\n\n## History\n\nCameras obscura, devices which project an image of the surroundings onto a\nsurface using only existing exterior light sources, usually sunlight, have a\nlong history in San Francisco. The first recorded reference to one in the city\nis from the 1860s in an attraction called Woodward's Gardens. A previous\nincarnation of the Cliff House was noted to have had a camera obscura on its\nfourth floor in 1896. This camera obscura was destroyed when the restaurant\nburned down in 1907. When the third Cliff House reopened in 1937, the owner\nwas approached by businessman Floyd Jennings with the idea of adding a camera\nobscura to the cliffs beside the restaurant. It was installed on the site in\n1946 and has been in continuous operation since then.\n\n## Technology\n\nThe San Francisco Camera Obscura projects an image onto a horizontal viewing\ntable via a reflected image from a viewpoint at the top of the building. A\nmetal hood in the cupola at the top of the building slowly rotates, making a\nfull revolution in about six minutes, allowing for a 360\u00b0 view around the\nbuilding. Light enters the building via an angled mirror in the metal hood. It\nthen passed through a lens with a 150 in. (381 cm) focal length and is\nprojected onto a parabolic white \"table\" in a black room. The origin of the\nlens is uncertain but it appears to have been part of a telescope, likely\nmanufactured by the Clark Lens Company of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n## Preservation\n\nThe Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of Historic Places in\n2001 for its engineering significance. While the exterior of the building was\nextensively modified in 1957 to appear as a giant camera, the internal\nworkings of the camera obscura, the basis of its placement on the Register,\nhave remained unchanged since its erection in 1946. The 1957 external\narchitecture was eligible to be evaluated for historical significance upon\nreaching fifty years of age in 2007.\n\n## See also\n\n  * National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco, California\n  * Sutro Historic District\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  *  \n\n",
      "# The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)\n\nThe Prisoners are fictional characters from the comic book series The Walking\nDead and the television series of the same name.\n\n## Appearances\n\n### Comic book series\n\nDuring Rick's coma, due to the news broadcasts, the inmates and guards had a\nbasic understanding of what was going on. Soon, many of the guards abandoned\nthe prison and the inmates to fend for themselves; at about the same time, a\nfew walkers had somehow gotten inside and began to kill the inmates. Several\nof the guards freed the inmates and joined together to fight their way out,\nresulting in heavy casualties. By the time Rick and his group discovered the\nprison, it was discovered that there were only four survivors left who were\nlocked up inside the cafeteria. The two groups come into conflict after one of\nthem, Thomas Richards, kills two of the survivors, Rachel and Susie Greene,\nHershel Greene's two youngest twin daughters. Dexter is falsely accused of the\ncrime due to him being the \"only\" prisoner who was arrested for murder (it is\nlater revealed that Thomas was arrested for murder as well and initially lied\nabout being arrested for committing tax fraud). Thomas also tries to kill\nAndrea who is left without an earlobe and two scars as well as Patricia. Rick\nsaves Andrea who beats Thomas brutally, and the second attempted murder on\nPatricia's life is stopped by a vengeful Maggie, who empties her entire\nfirearm magazine into Thomas. After Thomas is killed, Dexter and Andrew try to\nkick out Rick's group, resulting in walkers flooding the courtyard. During the\nstruggle, Rick shoots Dexter in the head, covering it up as friendly-fire, and\nAndrew surrenders, running outside the gates to die. Axel, the only prisoner\nto side with Rick, joins the group and later becomes a vital and trusted\nmember of the group until he is killed during the second assault on the Prison\nfrom Woodbury.\n\n### Television series\n\nThe prisoners debut in \"Sick\" where they witness Rick amputating the lower\nportion of Hershel's leg after he is bitten by walkers. Rick makes a deal with\nthe Prisoners to clear out a cell block for them in exchange for half of their\nfood. Tomas brutally Big Tiny after he is scratched by a walker, despite the\nlatter's pleas that he doesn't feel any effects. Tomas tries twice to\nassassinate Rick while clearing out the cells, so Rick kills Tomas with his\nmachete, and chases Andrew and locks him in a courtyard full of walkers. Rick,\nDaryl, and T-Dog hold Axel and Oscar at gunpoint; Axel begs for his life, but\nOscar refuses to beg. Rick's group shows mercy on them and allows them to stay\nin the prison, though he and Oscar are told to stay in another block. Oscar\nand Axel find it very disturbing to stay with their deceased inmates and begs\nRick to let them stay. T-Dog sympathizes with the prisoners and asks Rick to\nlet them join the group, but Rick is adamant about keeping to their earlier\ncompromise. Later, a horde of walkers is let into the prison courtyard,\nresulting in the deaths of T-Dog and Lori. When the prison's sirens sound off,\nOscar explains that the back-up generators are powering the alarms, and takes\nRick to shut them down. Andrew, who survived and is revealed to have let the\nwalkers loose and turned on the alarms, attacks Rick in the generator room.\nOscar kills Andrew, and Oscar and Axel are then allowed to stay with the\nothers. Axel and Oscar helps dig graves for those who died during the walker\nattack. Axel volunteers to go to Woodbury, but stays behind to protect the\nprison. Oscar instead decides to go. During his plan to rescue Glenn Rhee and\nMaggie Greene, members of Rick's group, Oscar is shot dead by a Woodbury\nsoldier. At the prison, Axel soon tries to win the favor of the group by\ntrying to stir up conversations and takes a liking to Beth and Carol, flirting\nwith them both. He is later shown saddened by Oscar's death. Axel, Hershel,\nand Beth, visit new arrivals Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben. He helps the\ngroup fortify the prison, and becomes friendly with Carol by telling her\nstories of his criminal past. He reveals that he was sentenced for trying to\nrob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the police did not believe him and\nfound his brother's gun and assumed it to be the real weapon and he was\nincarcerated. He is killed by The Governor by a shot to the head as part of a\nsurprise attack initiating his assault on the prison.\n\n## Casting and television series reception\n\nAndrew was portrayed by actor and rapper Markice Moore. He had originally\nauditioned for the pilot episode for the role of T-Dog, which went to IronE\nSingleton. Moore was later cast on season 3 as Andrew through his agency:\n\"Production was very hush hush about season 3 so I didn't even know I booked\nit officially until a week before shooting. I was elated; I couldn't believe\nit when my manager, Gail Tassell called to tell me the good news. I'm a huge\nfan of the show, it's my favorite show on TV, so yes it was a dream come\ntrue.\" Per Glen Mazzara, \"Andrew is really Tomas' right-hand man. These guys\nare really the ones who have been intimidating Axel and Oscar.\" Lew Temple was\nalso cast as Axel. He described him as a \"a gregarious Southern redneck-biker\ntype, who has big heart\" and \"a sense of compassion for his fellow man, but he\nis not as meek as he might appear, and though he has had to survive with four\nother hardened criminals, sans Oscar, this brave new world is something\nentirely different for him. He wants to associate and assimilate into the\ngroup of survivors, to the point of trying too hard to be accepted. He has a\nwry sense of humor and ironic quick wit. He will make you laugh and cry in the\nsame offering.\" Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that \"things\nbecome sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew\ninto a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick\ndoes not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a\ngrowing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter\nnoted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea\nof walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that\nthis decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of\nmurder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group\nand forced his own son to put down his mother\". Los Angeles Times columnist\nLaura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open\nthe lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you\nconsider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with\nvendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of Slant Magazine described\nthe episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a\nconspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of\ndisconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene\nends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a\nforeboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden\nstrike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how\nthe episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in\nthe show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode\n\"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking\nlengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan\nSepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it\nhelps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first\nplace. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who\nprobably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the\ngate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for Rolling Stone magazine that\nwhen Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar\nshoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers\nthat Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in\nthe series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I\nloved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people\nwith him! [...] Die Hard TWD fans will remember my character forever because\nof all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick! The fight scenes\nwere great! Especially in my death scene.\" Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club\nin his review of \"Sick\", joked of Oscar and Axel, \"I'm sure the remaining\nprisoners are completely harmless. They said they were harmless\u2014why would they\nlie?\" Showrunner Glen Mazzara commented that in \"Killer Within\", Axel and\nOscar want to be let into the group so they \"prove themselves, which is why\nOscar takes action and kills Andrew (Markice Moore), so that he can gain\naccess to the group. Throughout the entire season, it's a major theme: Who can\nRick let in? Not just into the prison, but let in emotionally.\" Los Angeles\nTimes columnist Laura Hudson observed tribalism as a trope in \"Killer Within\",\nwhich she ascribed to the reluctance of Maggie, Rick, and others in the group\nto allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. Hudson noted that these characters\nhad been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past\ncivilization for so long that they have reverted to \"traveling in a small,\ntightly knit group, hunting and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part\nof their it as a deadly threat.\" Zack Handlen commented in his review of \"Made\nto Suffer\" that \"Axel's enthusiasm for getting laid is sending off all kinds\nof creepy vibes, just the way he got real interested when he found out Beth\nwas 17 could be a bad sign. (His assumption that Carol was a lesbian was kind\nof funny, though.)\" Lew Temple found out about Axel's death about two weeks\nbefore the episode \"Home\" was filmed: \"[Glen Mazzara] had just come down to\nscreen the season 3 premiere episode for cast and crew on location. It was\ngreat! It was a lovely evening. We celebrated an amazing kick-off to a great\nnew season. And that particular night was the first time I had met Glen in\nperson. We had a really nice visit about what we were doing with Axel, and he\nwas so effusive and kind and lovely, saying \"I really dig how you're bringing\nAxel out, and the layers that are there. We can go in so many directions\nbecause you're keeping things close to the vest and we're not sure what he's\nabout.\" So I was fairly excited, and I got a call from his assistant the next\nday saying Glen wanted to speak with me, and I'm like oh, great!, assuming\nhe's going to want to speak more about character development. 15 to 20 seconds\ninto the conversation he says, \"Lew, this is really unfortunate but I've got\nto let you know that Axel is going to take a bullet to the head.\" Eric Goldman\nat IGN thought the death of Axel was a huge surprise. Phil Dyess-Nugent,\nwriting for The A.V. Club, commented that in his earlier appearances, \"Lew\nTemple managed to invest Axel with a certain mangy charm, and he really\nblossoms in this episode; when he's chatting up Carol and shining a little\nwhite-trash charm, I found myself thinking, \"Shit, I'm glad this guy's\naround,\" which is a thought I haven't had about Rick or Glenn or Maggie or\nHershel in living memory. Unfortunately, the show itself seems to share Rick's\ndistrust of letting in strangers.\"\n\n## References\n\n"

    "question": "When was the new international version bible rewritten without gender neutral terms?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is\nas well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in\nBible classes and children's ministries.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Committee on Bible Translation (CBT)\n  * Biblica\n  * Michael Marlowe on the NIV\n  * Read the New International Version (NIV) Bible \n  * \"Is Your Modern Translation Corrupt?\", Dr. James R.

      "# New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\n\nThe New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of the\nChristian Bible was the first of three inclusive language versions of the New\nInternational Version (NIV). It was published by Hodder and Stoughton (a\nsubsidiary of Lagardere Publishing) in London in 1995; New Testament and\nPsalms, with the full bible following in 1996. It was only released in the\nUnited Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. In 1997, an article by\nWorld Magazine accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the\nevangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by\nJames Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI,\nZondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States. The front\ncover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from\nthe standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear\nit was a feminist/Inclusive Language version. One of the criticisms was that\nthe word \u2018man\u2019 was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way\n(\u2018anyone\u2019 \u2018person\u2019 etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation\nwith the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of\nthe word \u2018man\u2019. A corrected edition was published in 1999 as the last edition.\nIn 2002 Today's New International Version (TNIV) was published for the English\nspeaking world as a replacement, but differing in its title with the addition\nof 'Today's'. This was also discontinued, with a slightly toned-down version\nof the TNIV being published as the New International Version in 2011.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# International Bible College\n\nInternational Bible College was a Christian Bible College located on northwest\nof historic downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Founded by Leonard Coote in\n1942, International Bible College was among the oldest Christian Colleges in\nTexas and the Southwest before it closed in 2010.\n\n## History\n\nInternational Bible College (now defunct) in San Antonio, was founded by Rev.\nLeonard W. Coote, an Oneness Pentecostal missionary to Japan. In 1942, when\nWorld War II temporarily halted his missionary efforts with the Japan\nApostolic Mission, Coote moved to San Antonio and began Emmanuel Gospel\nTabernacle (now Destiny Church) as well as IBC. He had previously established\na Bible training school for native workers in Ikoma, Japan, and wanted to\nbuild a similar Bible training center in the United States. The school,\nchartered as a nonprofit institution and dependent on private contributions\nfor support, was situated on a ten-acre campus atop \"Hallelujah Hill,\"\noverlooking San Antonio.\n\n### Peak enrollment and development\n\nIn 1965, the campus included 14 buildings; the library contained 3,000\nvolumes. By 1967 the campus included 19 buildings; that number grew to 27 by\n1995. Curriculum offerings in 1967 were a 2\u00bd-year course leading to a\nChristian worker's certificate, a three-year ministerial diploma course, and\ntwo four-year bible college courses-one leading to the Bachelor of Theology\ndegree (BTh) and the other to the Bachelor of Religious Education degree\n(BRE). Eventually IBC came to consider itself a \"nonsectarian school\", and at\nthe time of its closing was affiliated with the Oral Roberts University\nEducational Fellowship (ORUEF). Enrollment in 2001 was 91 full-time-equivalent\nstudents; faculty numbered 21. David W. Cook served as president until 2010.\n\n### Loss of certification and decline\n\nIBC was never accredited by a regional accrediting body but did obtain a\ncertificate of authority from the State of Texas authorizing it to grant\nbachelor's degrees in 1976. In the mid 1980s IBC began to face scrutiny from\nthe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and was required to gain\naccreditation from an accrediting body recognized by the State of Texas. When\nthe school failed to gain accreditation it was stripped of its ability to\ngrant degrees when its final certification expired on March 8, 1992. The\nschool was forced to change its name from International Bible College to\nInternational Bible Center. Enrollment steadily declined after the\ncertification was lost until the school closed in the fall of 2010.\n\n## Degrees\n\nThroughout most of its history IBC offered two baccalaureate degrees: the\nBachelor of Theology degree and the Bachelor of Religious Education degree. A\ntotal of 120 semester hours were to be completed, and for many years a 10,000\nword thesis was required. In addition it offered a three-year ministerial\ndiploma and one year Bible course. When it lost its ability to grant degrees\nin 1992 it began offering a Certificate of Biblical Studies, which required 64\nsemester hours, and a Diploma of Advanced Biblical Studies, requiring 128\nsemester hours.\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n",
      "# Armor of God\n\nThe phrase \"Armor of God\" is derived from Ephesians 6:11: \"Put on the whole\narmour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\"\n(King James Version). As a biblical reference, the metaphor may refer to\nphysical armour worn by God in metaphorical battles, or it may refer to\nvigilant righteousness in general as bestowed by the grace of God (Romans ,\nKing James Version): \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us\ntherefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of\nlight.\"\n\n## Quotes\n\nThe full quote as outlined in the King James Bible, is from Paul the Apostle's\nletter to the Ephesians : Given the many points of contact between the Book of\nWisdom and Paul's writings (particularly his Epistle to the Romans), it is\nperhaps unsurprising that the imagery of the Armor of God would be used here.\nCompare the various elements of the whole armor of God mentioned in the\nepistle to the Ephesians to Wisdom 5:17\u201320:\n\n## Context\n\nOther related passages, by Paul and references by later theologians, indicate\na metaphorical context for the Armor of God. For instance, Paul's letter to\nthe Romans indicates not a literal, but a figurative, application of the\nconcept (Romans , New International Version): In terms of the parts of the\nArmor of God, the various pieces (the belt of truth, the breastplate of\nrighteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the\nhelmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit) are correlated to what Paul\nwould have witnessed firsthand as the arms and armor of Roman legionaries\nduring his life in the Roman Empire.\n\n## Interpretations\n\nIn biblical exegesis, the vast majority of biblical scholars, Catholic,\nProtestant, and otherwise, agree that Paul used the concept as a reference to\nspiritual battle with the Devil. Christians are to put on this armor and deal\nwell with its upkeeping. This armor seems to be in direct correlation of that\nof the Roman Empire's soldiers.\n\n## Pieces of Armor\n\nThe following biblical texts in Ephesians chapter 6 mention six pieces of\narmor:\n\n  * belt\n  * breastplate\n  * footwear\n  * shield\n  * helmet\n  * sword\n\nThese pieces are described in Ephesians as follows: loins girt with truth\n(belt of truth), breastplate of righteousness, shoes with the preparation of\nthe gospel of peace (peace), shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and the\nsword of the spirit/word of God. The helmet of Salvation and the breastplate\nof Righteousness also appear in\n\n## See also\n\n  * Shield of the Trinity\n  * Bibleman\n  * New Testament military metaphors\n  * Miles Christianus\n  * Soldiers of Christ, Arise\n  * Territorial Spirit\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n",
      "# Luke\u2013Acts\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is the composite work of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the\nApostles in the New Testament. Both of these books of the Bible are credited\nto Luke. They also describe the narrative of those who continued to spread\nChristianity, ministry of Jesus and the subsequent ministry of the apostles\nand the Apostolic Age.\n\n## Authorship\n\nBoth the books of Luke and Acts are narratives written to a man named\nTheophilus. The book of Acts starts out with: \"The former treatise have I\nmade\", probably referring to the Gospel of Luke. Scholars believe that they\nwere written by the same person. Luke\u2013Acts has sometimes been presented as a\nsingle book in published Bibles or New Testaments, for example, in The\nOriginal New Testament (1985) and The Books of the Bible (2007). Luke is the\nlongest of the four gospels and the longest book in the New Testament;\ntogether with Acts of the Apostles it makes up a two-volume work from the same\nauthor, called Luke\u2013Acts. The cornerstone of Luke\u2013Acts' theology is \"salvation\nhistory\", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he\nhas acted, and will continue to act, in history.\n\n## Composition and setting\n\nIt divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with\nthe gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the arrival among men of Jesus\nthe Messiah, from his birth to the beginning of his earthly mission in the\nmeeting with John the Baptist followed by his earthly ministry, Passion,\ndeath, and resurrection (concluding the gospel story per se). The gospel's\nsources are the Gospel of Mark (for the narrative of Christ's earthly life),\nthe sayings collection called the Q source (for his teachings), and a\ncollection of material called the L (for Luke) source, which is found only in\nthis gospel. The work is Hellenized and written for a gentile audience\npossibly, in part, to counter a gnostic understanding of history. Marcion, a\nfamous 2nd-century heretic, who used a modified form of Luke known as the\nGospel of Marcion, did not use Acts, perhaps because he was unaware of it or\nintentionally excluded it from his biblical canon; Irenaeus, a proto-orthodox\napologist, is the first to use and mention Acts, specifically against\nMarcionism. Some scholars note that there are two versions of Luke\u2013Acts with\nthe longer version 10\u201320 percent longer than the shorter version. Scholars\ndisagree on which came first.\n\n## See also\n\n  * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * Joseph B.

    "gold_doc": [
      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created.

      "# Biblica\n\nBiblica, formerly International Bible Society, was founded in 1809 and is the\nworldwide copyright holder of the New International Version of the Bible\n(NIV), licensing commercial rights to Zondervan in the United States and to\nHodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom. Biblica is also a member of the\nForum of Bible Agencies International and Every Tribe Every Nation.\n\n## History\n\nBiblica was founded December 4, 1809, in New York City as the New York Bible\nSociety by a small group including Henry Rutgers, William Colgate, Theodorus\nVan Wyke and Thomas Eddy. Biblica experienced its first merger in 1819 when it\nmerged with the New York Auxiliary Bible Society. Since then it has undergone\nthe following changes:\n\n  * NYBS formed Young Men's NYBS (YMNYBS) in 1823.\n  * NYBS broke up into Ward Associations in 1827.\n  * Ward Associations reformed into New York City Bible Society (NYCBS) in 1828.\n  * NYCBS merged back into the Young Men's NYBS in 1832.\n  * Marine Bible Society merged with YMNYBS in 1840.

      "# New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\n\nThe New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of the\nChristian Bible was the first of three inclusive language versions of the New\nInternational Version (NIV). It was published by Hodder and Stoughton (a\nsubsidiary of Lagardere Publishing) in London in 1995; New Testament and\nPsalms, with the full bible following in 1996. It was only released in the\nUnited Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. In 1997, an article by\nWorld Magazine accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the\nevangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by\nJames Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI,\nZondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States. The front\ncover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from\nthe standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear\nit was a feminist/Inclusive Language version. One of the criticisms was that\nthe word \u2018man\u2019 was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way\n(\u2018anyone\u2019 \u2018person\u2019 etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation\nwith the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of\nthe word \u2018man\u2019. A corrected edition was published in 1999 as the last edition.\nIn 2002 Today's New International Version (TNIV) was published for the English\nspeaking world as a replacement, but differing in its title with the addition\nof 'Today's'. This was also discontinued, with a slightly toned-down version\nof the TNIV being published as the New International Version in 2011.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# International Bible College\n\nInternational Bible College was a Christian Bible College located on northwest\nof historic downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Founded by Leonard Coote in\n1942, International Bible College was among the oldest Christian Colleges in\nTexas and the Southwest before it closed in 2010.\n\n## History\n\nInternational Bible College (now defunct) in San Antonio, was founded by Rev.\nLeonard W. Coote, an Oneness Pentecostal missionary to Japan. In 1942, when\nWorld War II temporarily halted his missionary efforts with the Japan\nApostolic Mission, Coote moved to San Antonio and began Emmanuel Gospel\nTabernacle (now Destiny Church) as well as IBC. He had previously established\na Bible training school for native workers in Ikoma, Japan, and wanted to\nbuild a similar Bible training center in the United States. The school,\nchartered as a nonprofit institution and dependent on private contributions\nfor support, was situated on a ten-acre campus atop \"Hallelujah Hill,\"\noverlooking San Antonio.\n\n### Peak enrollment and development\n\nIn 1965, the campus included 14 buildings; the library contained 3,000\nvolumes. By 1967 the campus included 19 buildings; that number grew to 27 by\n1995. Curriculum offerings in 1967 were a 2\u00bd-year course leading to a\nChristian worker's certificate, a three-year ministerial diploma course, and\ntwo four-year bible college courses-one leading to the Bachelor of Theology\ndegree (BTh) and the other to the Bachelor of Religious Education degree\n(BRE). Eventually IBC came to consider itself a \"nonsectarian school\", and at\nthe time of its closing was affiliated with the Oral Roberts University\nEducational Fellowship (ORUEF). Enrollment in 2001 was 91 full-time-equivalent\nstudents; faculty numbered 21. David W. Cook served as president until 2010.\n\n### Loss of certification and decline\n\nIBC was never accredited by a regional accrediting body but did obtain a\ncertificate of authority from the State of Texas authorizing it to grant\nbachelor's degrees in 1976. In the mid 1980s IBC began to face scrutiny from\nthe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and was required to gain\naccreditation from an accrediting body recognized by the State of Texas. When\nthe school failed to gain accreditation it was stripped of its ability to\ngrant degrees when its final certification expired on March 8, 1992. The\nschool was forced to change its name from International Bible College to\nInternational Bible Center. Enrollment steadily declined after the\ncertification was lost until the school closed in the fall of 2010.\n\n## Degrees\n\nThroughout most of its history IBC offered two baccalaureate degrees: the\nBachelor of Theology degree and the Bachelor of Religious Education degree. A\ntotal of 120 semester hours were to be completed, and for many years a 10,000\nword thesis was required. In addition it offered a three-year ministerial\ndiploma and one year Bible course. When it lost its ability to grant degrees\nin 1992 it began offering a Certificate of Biblical Studies, which required 64\nsemester hours, and a Diploma of Advanced Biblical Studies, requiring 128\nsemester hours.\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n",
      "# Luke\u2013Acts\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is the composite work of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the\nApostles in the New Testament. Both of these books of the Bible are credited\nto Luke. They also describe the narrative of those who continued to spread\nChristianity, ministry of Jesus and the subsequent ministry of the apostles\nand the Apostolic Age.\n\n## Authorship\n\nBoth the books of Luke and Acts are narratives written to a man named\nTheophilus. The book of Acts starts out with: \"The former treatise have I\nmade\", probably referring to the Gospel of Luke. Scholars believe that they\nwere written by the same person. Luke\u2013Acts has sometimes been presented as a\nsingle book in published Bibles or New Testaments, for example, in The\nOriginal New Testament (1985) and The Books of the Bible (2007). Luke is the\nlongest of the four gospels and the longest book in the New Testament;\ntogether with Acts of the Apostles it makes up a two-volume work from the same\nauthor, called Luke\u2013Acts. The cornerstone of Luke\u2013Acts' theology is \"salvation\nhistory\", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he\nhas acted, and will continue to act, in history.\n\n## Composition and setting\n\nIt divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with\nthe gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the arrival among men of Jesus\nthe Messiah, from his birth to the beginning of his earthly mission in the\nmeeting with John the Baptist followed by his earthly ministry, Passion,\ndeath, and resurrection (concluding the gospel story per se). The gospel's\nsources are the Gospel of Mark (for the narrative of Christ's earthly life),\nthe sayings collection called the Q source (for his teachings), and a\ncollection of material called the L (for Luke) source, which is found only in\nthis gospel. The work is Hellenized and written for a gentile audience\npossibly, in part, to counter a gnostic understanding of history. Marcion, a\nfamous 2nd-century heretic, who used a modified form of Luke known as the\nGospel of Marcion, did not use Acts, perhaps because he was unaware of it or\nintentionally excluded it from his biblical canon; Irenaeus, a proto-orthodox\napologist, is the first to use and mention Acts, specifically against\nMarcionism. Some scholars note that there are two versions of Luke\u2013Acts with\nthe longer version 10\u201320 percent longer than the shorter version. Scholars\ndisagree on which came first.\n\n## See also\n\n  * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * Joseph B.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision.

      "# Miss You (Rolling Stones song)\n\n\"Miss You\" is a song written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It was\nreleased as a single by The Rolling Stones on Rolling Stones Records in May\n1978, one month in advance of their album Some Girls, and peaked at number one\non the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the UK Singles Chart. An extended\nversion, called the \"Special Disco Version\", was released as the band's first\ndance remix on a 12-inch single.\n\n## Inspiration and recording\n\n\"Miss You\" was written by Mick Jagger jamming with keyboardist Billy Preston\nduring rehearsals for the March 1977 El Mocambo club gigs, recordings from\nwhich appeared on side three of double live album Love You Live (1977). Keith\nRichards is credited as co-writer as was the case for all Rolling Stones\noriginals written by either partner or in tandem. Jagger and Ronnie Wood\ninsist that \"Miss You\" wasn't conceived as a disco song, while Richards said,\n\"...'Miss You' was a damn good disco record; it was calculated to be one.\" In\nany case, what was going on in discotheques did make it to the recording.\nCharlie Watts said, \"A lot of those songs like 'Miss You' on 'Some Girls'...\nwere heavily influenced by going to the discos. You can hear it in a lot of\nthose four-to-the-floor and the Philadelphia-style drumming.\" For the bass\npart, Bill Wyman started from Preston's bass guitar on the song demo. Chris\nKimsey, who engineered the recording, said Wyman went \"...to quite a few clubs\nbefore he got that bass line sorted out\", which Kimsey said \"made that song.\"\nWyman recalled: \"When I did the riff for 'Miss You' \u2013 which made the song, and\nevery band in the world copied it for the next year: Rod Stewart, all of them\n\u2013 it still said Jagger/Richard. When I wrote the riff for 'Jumpin' Jack\nFlash', it became Jagger/Richard, and that's the way it was. It just became\npart and parcel of the way the band functioned.\" Jagger sang a good part of\nthe chorus using falsetto \"ooh\"s often in unison with harmonica, guitar and\nelectric piano. Unlike most of Some Girls, \"Miss You\" features several studio\nmusicians. In addition to Sugar Blue who, according to Wood, was found by\nJagger busking on the streets of Paris, Ian McLagan plays understated\nWurlitzer electric piano, and Mel Collins provides the tenor saxophone solo\nfor the instrumental break. The 12\" version of the song runs over eight\nminutes and features additional instrumentation and solos, particularly on\nguitar. It was remixed by Bob Clearmountain, then an up-and-coming mixer and\nengineer.

      "# Look Away\n\n\"Look Away\" is a 1988 power ballad by American rock band Chicago. Written by\nDiane Warren, produced by Ron Nevison, and with Bill Champlin on lead vocals,\nit is the second single from the band's album Chicago 19. \"Look Away\" is\nChicago's largest selling single of all, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for two\nweeks in December 1988, matching the chart success of the group's \"If You\nLeave Me Now\" (1976) and \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\" (1982). \"Look Away\" is\nChicago's seventh song to have peaked at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart\nas well as the No. 1 song on the 1989 year-end Billboard Hot 100 chart, even\nthough it never held the No. 1 spot at all in 1989. The song, unlike hits from\nearly in Chicago's career, does not prominently feature horns. It is also the\nband's only No. 1 single following the 1985 departure of Peter Cetera.\n\n## Production\n\nAccording to drummer Danny Seraphine, Chicago's manager Howard Kaufman\nsuggested that the band bring in outside songwriting help. Kaufman recommended\nDiane Warren, who also composed the band's single \"I Don't Wanna Live Without\nYour Love,\" and producer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Heart on the number\none hits \"These Dreams\" and \"Alone.\" Warren wrote \"Look Away\" from the man's\nperspective and submitted a demo to Chicago's management company. \"Diane's\ndemos always sound really good,\" Nevison said. \"Her demos are always very\nsimple, but they always have great vocal performances.\" Bassist Jason Scheff\nremarked, \"The songs that last for me are the ones I don't get at first,\" and\nadded, \"I remember hearing 'Look Away' and thinking it's okay, but not great.\nThank God I'm not an A&R; man.\" Before being submitted to Chicago, the song\nwas one of two ballads offered by Epic Records to Cheap Trick, who chose \"The\nFlame\" instead. The song featured Bill Champlin on lead vocals and furthered\nChicago's shift towards de-emphasizing the band's brass section compared to\ntheir earlier years. Scheff noted that with Peter Cetera having left the group\nand \"making his own records, it was good for us to release some songs with a\ndifferent sound (like) Bill's voice. Then we wouldn't be saturating radio with\nChicago-sounding songs.\"\n\n## Reception\n\n\"Look Away\" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in September 1988\nand reached No. 1, where it spent two weeks, in December. Champlin said he was\nunaware of the feat at the time. \"Everybody said, 'I hear your song every\nday,'\" he recalled. \"I go, 'What song?' I was kind of oblivious to the whole\nthing, busy working on new stuff. That's what happens. As everybody else gets\naware of what you're doing, you're usually about five or six tunes past it.\"\nThe single was certified gold in January and ranked No. 1 on the 1989\nBillboard Year-End singles chart. It also reached No. 1 on the Adult\nContemporary chart. Outside the U.S., \"Look Away\" peaked at No. 1 in Canada,\nNo. 10 in the Netherlands, No. 15 in Sweden, and No. 20 in Belgium. A British\nman now claims he is the author of the song and has launched legal\nproceedings.\n\n## Track listing\n\n7\" Vinyl; Cassette\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n### All-time charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## References\n\n## See also\n\nList of Hot Adult Contemporary number ones of 1988\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Remember Me (T.I. song)\n\n\"Remember Me\" was the planned first single from the re-release of T.I.'s sixth\nalbum, Paper Trail; however, the re-release was eventually shelved, although\nthe song would still be released digitally.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the UK, the song was released as a single and was taken from an EP,\nentitled Paper Trail: Case Closed. It features Mary J. Blige. The song was\nofficially released to urban radio the week of July 7, 2009. The main message\nof the song is remembrance.

      "# You'll Never Walk Alone\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" is a show tune from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein\nmusical Carousel. In the second act of the musical, Nettie Fowler, the cousin\nof the protagonist Julie Jordan, sings \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" to comfort\nand encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, falls on\nhis knife and dies after a failed robbery attempt. It is reprised in the final\nscene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise (Billy and Julie's\ndaughter) is a member. The now invisible Billy, who has been granted the\nchance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself, watches the\nceremony and is able to silently motivate the unhappy Louise to join in the\nsong. The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world,\nwhere it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday; this\ntradition developed at Liverpool F.C. after the chart success of the 1963\nsingle of the song by the local Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers.\n\n## Background\n\nChristine Johnson, who created the role of Nettie Fowler, introduced the song\nin the original Broadway production. Later in the show Jan Clayton, as Julie\nJordan, reprised it, with the chorus joining in. In the film, it is first sung\nby Claramae Turner as Nettie. The weeping Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones) tries\nto sing it but cannot; it is later reprised by Julie and those attending the\ngraduation.\n\n## Subsequent history\n\nBesides the recordings of the song on the Carousel cast albums and the film\nsoundtrack, the song has been recorded by many artists, with notable hit\nversions made by Roy Hamilton, Frank Sinatra, Roy Orbison, Billy Eckstine,\nGerry and the Pacemakers, Lee Towers, Judy Garland, Elvis Presley, Johnny\nCash, Andy Williams, Glen Campbell, Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge,\nOlivia Newton-John and Doris Day. Progressive rock group Pink Floyd took a\nrecording by the Liverpool Kop choir, and \"interpolated\" it into their own\nsong, \"Fearless\", on their 1971 album Meddle. From 1964 through 2010, Jerry\nLewis concluded the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day MDA Telethon by singing the\nsong. After the end of a concert by the rock band Queen, the audience\nspontaneously sang this song, according to lead guitarist Brian May, and this\nhelped to inspire the creation of their songs \"We Are the Champions\" and \"We\nWill Rock You\". Italian-American tenor Sergio Franchi sang a notable version\naccompanied by the Welsh Men's Choir on the 9 June 1968 telecast of The Ed\nSullivan Show. He also covered this song in his 1964 RCA Victor album The\nExciting Voice of Sergio Franchi. In 1990 at the concert at Wembley Stadium,\nLondon, the audience spontaneously broke out into a mass rendition. Mandela\nturned to Adelaide Tambo who accompanied him onto the stage and asked what the\nsong was. She replied, \"A football song\". American singer Barbra Streisand\nperformed this song in a surprise appearance at the close of the 2001 Emmy\nAwards, in honor of the victims of the September 11 attacks. To mark the first\nanniversary of the attacks, Ren\u00e9e Fleming sang the song at the Concert for\nAmerica. Fleming sang the song again at the Inauguration of Barack Obama on\nJanuary 20, 2009. In 2010, the song was sung during the Last Night of the\nProms, with the choir at the Royal Albert Hall in London joined by crowds of\nthe public from Hillsborough Castle, Northern Ireland; Caird Hall, Dundee;\nHyde Park, London; Salford, Greater Manchester; and Wales, to mark the\nfiftieth anniversary of the death of Oscar Hammerstein II. It has been the\nsong of the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps song since 1954, where they\nfirst performed it as a part of their first field show in 1954. Challenged by\nthe Rosemont Cavaliers singing \"Over the Rainbow\" in 1957, the corps responded\nwith \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", and it has been the official corps song ever\nsince. Punk band Dropkick Murphys covered the song for their 2017 album 11\nShort Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey said in a December\n2016 interview discussing the reason behind their version. \"As you may know,\nopiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston)\narea. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my\ncousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. I was leaving\none of the wakes and this song came on and as I was listening to the lyrics it\nsummed up exactly how I was feeling. Sad, but knowing there is hope. You never\nhave to be alone. I hope you like our version\". Lee Towers has been performing\nthe song from an aerial work platform at the start of every Rotterdam Marathon\nsince 1995.\n\n## Sporting anthem\n\n### Liverpool F.C.\n\nIn the UK, the song's most successful cover was released in 1963 by the\nLiverpudlian Merseybeat group Gerry and the Pacemakers, peaking at number one\non the UK singles chart for four consecutive weeks. Sung by Liverpool fans in\n1963, the song quickly became the football anthem of Liverpool F.C., which\nadopted \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" as its official motto on its coat of arms.\nThe song is sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game\nat Anfield with the Gerry and the Pacemakers version played over the public\naddress system. According to former player Tommy Smith, lead vocalist Gerry\nMarsden presented Liverpool manager Bill Shankly with a recording of his\nforthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963.\n\"Shanks was in awe of what he heard. ... Football writers from the local\nnewspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind\nbetween games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had\nadopted Gerry Marsden's forthcoming single as the club song.\" The squad was\nsubsequently invited to perform the track with the band on The Ed Sullivan\nShow with Marsden stating, \"Bill came up to me. He said, 'Gerry my son, I have\ngiven you a football team and you have given us a song'.\" Shankly picked the\nsong as his eighth and final selection for the BBC's Desert Island Discs on\nthe eve of the 1965 FA Cup Final. As Liverpool fans sang \"You'll Never Walk\nAlone\" at Wembley during the 1965 FA Cup Final win over Leeds, commentator\nKenneth Wolstenholme referred to it as \"Liverpool's signature tune\". Marsden\ntold BBC Radio how, in the 1960s, the disc jockey at Anfield would play the\ntop ten commercial records in descending order, with the number one single\nplayed last, shortly before kickoff. Liverpool fans on the Kop would sing\nalong, but unlike with other hit singles, once \"You'll Never Walk Alone\"\ndropped out of the top ten, instead of disregarding the song, supporters\ncontinued to sing it. In his commentary on the memorial service following the\nHillsborough disaster in 1989, Peter Jones recited the lyrics, which were then\nsung by a cathedral choir. Aretha Franklin's recording of the song was played\nby John Peel in his first show following the disaster, when he became too\nupset to carry on broadcasting for a period. In 2019, during a Take That\nconcert at Anfield, lead singer and Liverpool fan Gary Barlow brought out a\nguest vocalist, Gerry Marsden \u2013 who had come out of retirement for the\nperformance \u2013 and they sang the club's anthem \u201cYou'll Never Walk Alone\u201d.\n\n### Other teams\n\nThe song was adopted by Scottish team Celtic after a 1966 Cup Winners Cup\nsemi-final against Liverpool at Anfield, and is now sung by Celtic fans prior\nto every home European tie, and later by Germany's Borussia Dortmund who\nLiverpool went on to play in the cup final. The song has also been adopted by\nDutch team FC Twente after it was officially given to them by the former\nAnfield stadium speaker George Septhon during the last game in the Diekman\nstadium, before moving to the new Arke Stadion. Today, Twente fans sing the\nsong before every home game. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, Feyenoord and SC\nCambuur have adopted the song as well. Additional football teams which now use\nthe song include 1. FSV Mainz 05, TSV 1860 Munich, Belgium's Club Brugge KV,\nJapan's F.C. Tokyo, Spain's CD Lugo, Greece's PAOK and Indonesia's Bali\nUnited. In ice hockey, the song has been adopted by German Deutsche Eishockey\nLiga side Krefeld Pinguine and Croatian Medve\u0161\u010dak Zagreb. A special recording\nof the song was made in solidarity with Bradford City following the Valley\nParade fire in 1985, when 56 spectators died and many more were seriously\ninjured. The song was performed by The Crowd, which was a supergroup featuring\nGerry Marsden, Paul McCartney and others, and spent two weeks at number one in\nthe UK. Some years later, after witnessing a rendition of \"You'll Never Walk\nAlone\" at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee,\nAlejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to his country's\nwordless national anthem, the Marcha Real, ahead of Madrid's bid to host the\n2016 Olympic Games. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, legislator Tam Yiu\nChung quoted the song during a Legislative Council of Hong Kong meeting, to\nsalute the Hong Kong Police, who had received widespread criticism for using\nexcessive force against pro-democracy protesters. More than 2,000 Liverpool\nFootball Club fans in Hong Kong condemned his inappropriate use of the song,\ncomparing his support of the police action to the police actions in the 1989\nHillsborough disaster, where South Yorkshire Police were found to have\ndistorted facts relating to the unlawful killing by negligence of 96 Liverpool\nsupporters. On 13 March 2016, after Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 win against 1. FSV\nMainz 05 in the German Bundesliga, supporters of both teams performed the song\nto commemorate a Dortmund fan who died from a cardiac arrest in the stands\nduring the game.\n\n## Recorded versions\n\n  * The Adicts\n  * Alfie Boe (\"Onward\") (2007)\n  * Alicia Keys (Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, 2005)\n  * Andr\u00e9 Rieu (2009 Maastricht concert)\n  * Andy Williams (with orchestra conducted by Archie Bleyer)\n  * Aretha Franklin (1972, on the live album Amazing Grace)\n  * Barry Manilow & Cilla Black (1993)\n  * Bela B. & the Tikiwolves feat.

      "# Christine Johnson (actress)\n\nChristine Johnson Smith (September 8, 1911 - June 9, 2010), usually credited\nas Christine Johnson, was an American contralto opera singer and actress who\nsang at the Metropolitan Opera and other opera houses. She is best known,\nhowever, for creating the role of Nettie Fowler in the original Broadway\nproduction of Carousel.\n\n## Life and career\n\nJohnson was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky and moved to Owensboro, Kentucky\nafter her freshman year of high school, graduating from Owensboro High School\nin 1929. She showed early promise, starring in school plays and singing in\nchurches. After high school, she studied voice at the Nashville Conservatory\nof Music and sang for radio station WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Johnson moved\nto New York City in 1937 and began to work with NBC's Radio City Music Hall\nand Lyn Murray and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at CBS, sometimes touring\nin concerts in North America. She studied voice and operatic repertoire in New\nYork with Ernst Knoth and Sidney Dietch. In 1941, she sang Dorabella in Cos\u00ec\nfan tutte, opening the Tanglewood opera house at Lenox, Massachusetts. In\n1942, she received good notices for the role of Mrs. Page in The Merry Wives\nof Windsor. Other roles followed for her, with the New Opera Company of New\nYork under Emil Cooper, at San Francisco Opera and elsewhere, in Macbeth, The\nFair at Sorochyntsi, The Queen of Spades, Cavalleria rusticana, Carmen, La\nforza del destino, The Girl of the Golden West, the title role in Roberta,\nAzucena in Il trovatore and Maddalena in Rigoletto. During this period, she\nalso sang at New York's Town Hall. In 1943, Johnson won the Metropolitan Opera\nAuditions of the Air which led to her becoming the youngest person ever to\nsing the role of Erda in Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold at that opera house.\nShe appeared on CBS radio's The Squibb Show twice in 1944. There she sang\n\"It's A Lovely Day\" and \"My Heart's in the Highlands\" with Lyn Murray and His\nOrchestra.

She also sang\nthe role on the show's original cast album. Johnson stayed with the show for\nhundreds of performances and then toured and studied in Italy for a time. She\nrejoined Carousel during the national tour and continued as Nettie through its\nBroadway revival in 1949. After Carousel closed, Johnson moved back to\nOwensboro, where she married surgeon Robert Smith in 1950 and raised two\ndaughters, Robin and Nancy. She taught voice for many years, and one of her\npupils was Florence Henderson. She also served on local arts committees and\nparticipated in some local productions.

      "# The Crowd (band)\n\nThe Crowd was a charity supergroup formed specifically to produce a charity\nrecord for the Bradford City stadium fire, in which 56 people died on 11 May\n1985. The group consisted of singers, actors, television personalities and\nothers. Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers had decided to make a\ncharity record to aid the families of the victims of the disaster (the\nBradford City Disaster Fund). The re-recording of the 1963 number 1 hit song\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" from the broadway musical Carousel, also a 'football\nanthem' for Liverpool supporters, entered the UK charts at No. 52, leaping to\nnumber 4 the following week and then reaching Number 1 on 1 June 1985. The\nrecord also topped the Irish Singles Chart. The single gave Gerry Marsden a\n'first' in British recording history, by becoming the first person ever to top\nthe charts with two versions of the same song.\n\n## Contributing musicians and celebrities\n\nThe band and celebrity members included: Bruce Forsyth, Denny Laine, Jim\nDiamond, Tony Christie, Rick Wakeman, John Conteh, The Barron Knights, Jess\nConrad, Kiki Dee, the Foxes, Rolf Harris, Graham Gouldman, Kenny Lynch, Rick\nWild of The Overlanders, Keith Chegwin, Tony Hicks, Colin Blunstone, Tim\nHinkley, Johnny Logan, Zak Starkey, Girlschool, Black Lace, John Otway, Gary\nHolton, Nigel Holton, Hank Hancocks, Peter Cook, the Nolans, John Entwistle of\nThe Who, Mot\u00f6rhead, Karen Clark, Dave Lee Travis, Graham Dene, Ed Stewart,\nPhil Lynott, Smokie, Joe Fagin, Eddie Hardin, Gerard Kenny, Chris Robinson,\nTim Healy, Kin Kelly, John Verity, Rose Marie, David Shilling, Chris Norman,\nPete Spencer, Bernie Winters, Robert Heaton, and Frank Allen of The Searchers.\nPaul McCartney contributed some words on the B-side of the record which was\ntitled \"Messages\".\n\n## See also\n\n  * Bradford City stadium fire\n  * Bradford City A.F.C.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Black Lace website\n\n",
      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# I'll Be Seeing You (song)\n\n\"I'll Be Seeing You\" is a popular song about nostalgia, with music by Sammy\nFain and lyrics by Irving Kahal. Published in 1938, it was inserted into the\nBroadway musical Right This Way, which closed after fifteen performances. The\ntitle of the 1944 film I'll Be Seeing You was taken from this song at the\nsuggestion of the film's producer, Dore Schary. The song is included in the\nfilm's soundtrack. The resemblance between the main tune's first four lines\nand a passage within the theme of the last movement of Gustav Mahler's Third\nSymphony (1896) was pointed out by Deryck Cooke in 1970. Mahler may have\nderived this passage from the overture to Daniel Auber's comic opera (Marco\nSpada (1852). Billie Holiday's 1944 recording of the song was the final\ntransmission sent by NASA to the Opportunity rover on Mars when its mission\nended on 13 February 2019.\n\n## Chart appearances\n\nThe recording by Bing Crosby became a hit in 1944, reaching number one for the\nweek of July 1. Frank Sinatra's version with Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra\nfrom 1940 charted in 1944 and peaked at No. 4. A recording by the Poni-Tails\nreached number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending November 16,\n1959.\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\n\n\"Anything You Can Do\" is a song composed by Irving Berlin for the 1946\nBroadway musical Annie Get Your Gun. The song is a duet, with one male singer\nand one female singer attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex\ntasks. In the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting\ncontest between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler. Its most memorable lines are,\n\"Anything you can do I can do better; I can do anything better than you.\" The\nsong was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray\nMiddleton. During the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example,\nsing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, and boast\nof their abilities and accomplishments, such as opening safes and living on\nbread and cheese, although Annie always seems to counter Frank's argument.\nNeither can \"bake a pie,\" though.\n\n## Notable versions\n\n  * Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton from original cast recording (1946).\n  * Bing Crosby, Dick Haymes and The Andrews Sisters - recorded for Decca Records on March 19, 1947.\n  * Groucho Marx and his daughter Melinda Marx (a child at the time) in home movie footage used for select TV specials.\n  * Ethel Merman and Howard Keel (1950)\n  * Betty Hutton and Howard Keel in the 1950 film version of the musical\n  * Mary Martin and John Raitt on the 1957 National Tour recording\n  * Doris Day and Robert Goulet for the Columbia Records album Annie Get Your Gun (1963)\n  * Ethel Merman and Bruce Yarnell in the 1966 revival recording.\n  * Dusty Springfield and Freddie Paris on Bandstand (1967).\n  * Robert Morse and an office computer in 1968 TV series That's Life, episode S1E11 \"Bobby's Pink Slip\"\n  * Barbara Walters and Howard Cosell on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell in 1975 debating who interviews people better.\n  * Ethel Merman and Miss Piggy (1976) in The Muppet Show, episode 1.22\n  * In 1963, Heidi Br\u00fchl and Robert Trehy performed a German version in the stage version of this musical at the Theater des Westens in Berlin.\n  * In 1977, Tina Arena and John Bowles recorded a version for their album Tiny Tina and Little John.\n  * In 1990, Kidsongs released , which contained a version of this song, where they play various arcade games at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park.\n  * Fran Drescher and Madeline Zima (1994) in The Nanny, episode S1E22 \"I Don't Remember Mama\"\n  * Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm, Gatorade \"Michael vs. Mia\" commercial (1997), performed by Sophia Ramos\n  * Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat in the 1999 Broadway revival version of the musical\n  * Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso in a 2007 Mercedes-Benz commercial with Mika H\u00e4kkinen performing the last line.\n  * Blaire Elbert and Madeline Powell Cactus Cuties, performed at Cactus Theatere in Texas in 2008.\n  * American rapper J.

    "gold_doc": [
      "# Brenda's Got a Baby\n\n\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is the second single by Tupac Shakur from his debut\nalbum 2Pacalypse Now. The song, which features R&B; singer Dave Hollister\nsinging background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl\nnamed Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song\nexplores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their\nfamilies. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the\nplight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in\ngeneral, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father,\nthe government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song while filming\nthe feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old\ngirl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash\ncompactor.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the\nrest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with\nTupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also\nnotes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a \"damn shame\"\nbecause she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her\nfather is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who\nis also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac\nexplains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got\ntheir cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin\n(her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is\nmerely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom\nfloor. She throws the baby into a 'trash heap' but later retrieves it when she\nhears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed\nof herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone,\nand unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results\nin robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn\nmoney and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of\nher parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final\nminute consists of a chorus singing \"Don't you know she's got a baby?\"\nrepeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song \"Street\nRiders\" 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals\nwith this same subject called \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\". The song can be\nfound on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what\nShakur narrates.

      "# Brenda's Got a Baby\n\n\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is the second single by Tupac Shakur from his debut\nalbum 2Pacalypse Now. The song, which features R&B; singer Dave Hollister\nsinging background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl\nnamed Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song\nexplores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their\nfamilies. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the\nplight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in\ngeneral, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father,\nthe government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song while filming\nthe feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old\ngirl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash\ncompactor.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the\nrest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with\nTupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also\nnotes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a \"damn shame\"\nbecause she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her\nfather is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who\nis also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac\nexplains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got\ntheir cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin\n(her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is\nmerely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom\nfloor. She throws the baby into a 'trash heap' but later retrieves it when she\nhears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed\nof herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone,\nand unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results\nin robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn\nmoney and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of\nher parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final\nminute consists of a chorus singing \"Don't you know she's got a baby?\"\nrepeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song \"Street\nRiders\" 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals\nwith this same subject called \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\". The song can be\nfound on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what\nShakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and \"Brenda\" and then the actual\nstory starts. Ethel \"Edy\" Proctor portrays Brenda. The video begins with\n\"based on a true story,\" although the characters themselves are fictitious,\nShakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old\ngirl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a\ntrash can.

      "# Monday Night Football (British TV programme)\n\nMonday Night Football (MNF) (also known as Bet365 Monday Night Football for\nsponsorship reasons) is a British football programme on Sky Sports which\nbroadcasts live English football from the Premier League.\n\n## Original run\n\nSky television's acquisition of rights to broadcast live Premier League\nfootball from the start of the 1992\u201393 season saw them attempt innovations\nsuch as digital on-screen graphics (DOG) and Monday Night live games. The\nfirst Monday Night Football game broadcast was between Manchester City and\nQueens Park Rangers on 17 August 1992, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. To give the\nbroadcasts a different look to Sky's Super Sunday strand, the broadcaster\nintroduced the Sky Strikers, a dance troupe similar to American cheerleaders.\nThis pre-match and half-time entertainment was dropped after the first season.\nThe show had a number of different formats after its launch. The first change\nled to the merging of Andy Gray's Boot Room format into the show; analysing\nthe previous weekend's football matches utilising the latest computer\ntechnology combined with Gray's individual analysis. As the UEFA Champions\nLeague gained in importance for Premier League clubs, the number of games\nplayed on Monday night declined. Sky Sports then reverted to a format similar\nto that of Ford Super Sunday with a presenter (Jeff Stelling) and studio\nguests. In 2004\u201305, the analysis section was then incorporated into an\nadditional programme shown after Ford Super Sunday called Ford Super Sunday:\nThe Last Word. The show ended after the 2006\u201307 season when Setanta and\nsubsequently ESPN obtained the rights for Monday night Premier League games.\n\n## Current run\n\nMonday Night Football returned from the 2010\u201311 season after Sky regained the\nrights to Monday night Premier League games. The games broadcast kick off at\n8:00 pm on Monday nights. The show also started broadcasting in high-\ndefinition. Due to the structure of the broadcasting packages for the 2010\u201313\nseasons, Sky broadcast a minimum of 12 live Premier League games on Monday\nnights. Before the departures of Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the programme had\na different appearance to Super Sunday, presented by Keys and Gray from a\npurpose-built studio with Andy Gray's analysis also returning from its Sunday\nevening slot. After the pair's unscheduled departure from Sky in January 2011,\nthe first half-hour of analysis was dropped, and for the remainder of the\nseason the show was presented from the stadium in largely the same format as\nSunday or midweek Premier League matches with a rotation of presenters and\npundits, although the distinct \"MNF\" branding and graphics were retained. Ed\nChamberlin was given the presenting role for the 2011\u201312 season, with Gary\nNeville as the new analyst. The show also returned to its previous format in\nthe purpose-built analysis studio, with Chamberlin and Neville carrying out\nthe same roles as Keys and Gray the previous season. In 2013, Jamie Carragher\njoined the Monday Night Football show, to form a regular three-man line-up\nalongside Chamberlin and Neville, after having announced his retirement from\nfootball at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. The first Monday Night Football of\nthe 2013-14 season and Jamie Carragher's first appearance aired on 19 August\n2013 with the Manchester City against Newcastle United game. Manchester City\nwon the game 4\u20130. Following Neville's appointment as head coach of Valencia in\nDecember 2015, he left the show to focus on his managerial duties. After\nleaving Valencia in March 2016 due to a poor run of results, Neville's return\nto Sky in his previous role was confirmed on 10 August 2016 ahead of the\n2016\u201317 Premier League football season; he made his on-air return on 14\nAugust. David Jones also took over as anchor presenter from Chamberlin who had\nleft Sky to take over ITV's horse racing coverage.\n\n## Presenters\n\n  * 1992\u20132003, 2010\u20132011: Richard Keys\n  * 2003\u20132005: Ian Payne\n  * 2005\u20132007: Jeff Stelling\n  * 2011\u20132016: Ed Chamberlin\n  * 2016\u2013present: David Jones\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fantasy novel written by British\nauthor J.K. Rowling and the third in the Harry Potter series. The book follows\nHarry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione\nGranger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban\nthey believe is one of Lord Voldemort's old allies. The book was published in\nthe United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8\nSeptember 1999 by Scholastic, Inc. Rowling found the book easy to write,\nfinishing it just a year after she began writing it. The book sold 68,000\ncopies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since\nhas sold over three million in the country. The book won the 1999 Whitbread\nChildren's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for\nBest Fantasy Novel and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.\nThe film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796\nmillion and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on Harry\nPotter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were also released for several platforms,\nand most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n## Plot\n\nHarry is back at the Dursleys' for the summer holidays, where he sees on\nMuggle television that a convict named Sirius Black has escaped from prison.\nAfter being provoked by his Aunt Marge, Harry accidentally inflates her and\nruns away from home, fearing expulsion from school. After being picked up by\nthe Knight Bus, he travels to the Leaky Cauldron, where Cornelius Fudge, the\nMinister for Magic, asks Harry to stay in Diagon Alley for his own protection.\nWhile there, he meets his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\nBefore leaving for Hogwarts, Harry learns from Arthur Weasley that Sirius\nBlack is a convicted murderer from the wizarding world and that Black has\nescaped from the wizard prison Azkaban to kill Harry. On the way to Hogwarts,\na Dementor (an Azkaban prison guard that feeds on positive thoughts) boards\nthe train, causing Harry to relive his parents' deaths before fainting. The\nnew Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, protects Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione from the Dementor. They later learn Dementors will be patrolling\nthe school in an attempt to catch Black. Although Professor Lupin is popular\nwith his students, the Potions master, Snape, seems to hate him. During a\nQuidditch match, Harry faints and falls off his broomstick after Dementors\ninvade the field. His Nimbus 2000 is blown away and smashed by the Whomping\nWillow, a violent tree in the grounds. Afterward, Professor Lupin teaches\nHarry how to defend himself from Dementors using the Patronus charm. Harry\nuses The Marauder's Map (a map of Hogwarts marking all its inhabitants and\nsecret tunnels given to him by Fred and George Weasley) for an unauthorised\nvisit to the magical village of Hogsmeade.

He convinces Lupin and\nBlack to send Pettigrew to Azkaban instead. As they attempt to bring Pettigrew\nback to Hogwarts, the full moon transforms Lupin into a wolf. Lupin, not in\nhis own mind, attacks them. In the confusion, Pettigrew transforms into a rat\nand escapes.

The book was published in\nthe United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8\nSeptember 1999 by Scholastic, Inc. Rowling found the book easy to write,\nfinishing it just a year after she began writing it.

The book won the 1999 Whitbread\nChildren's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for\nBest Fantasy Novel and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.\nThe film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796\nmillion and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on Harry\nPotter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were also released for several platforms,\nand most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n## Plot\n\nHarry is back at the Dursleys' for the summer holidays, where he sees on\nMuggle television that a convict named Sirius Black has escaped from prison.\nAfter being provoked by his Aunt Marge, Harry accidentally inflates her and\nruns away from home, fearing expulsion from school. After being picked up by\nthe Knight Bus, he travels to the Leaky Cauldron, where Cornelius Fudge, the\nMinister for Magic, asks Harry to stay in Diagon Alley for his own protection.\nWhile there, he meets his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\nBefore leaving for Hogwarts, Harry learns from Arthur Weasley that Sirius\nBlack is a convicted murderer from the wizarding world and that Black has\nescaped from the wizard prison Azkaban to kill Harry. On the way to Hogwarts,\na Dementor (an Azkaban prison guard that feeds on positive thoughts) boards\nthe train, causing Harry to relive his parents' deaths before fainting. The\nnew Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, protects Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione from the Dementor. They later learn Dementors will be patrolling\nthe school in an attempt to catch Black. Although Professor Lupin is popular\nwith his students, the Potions master, Snape, seems to hate him. During a\nQuidditch match, Harry faints and falls off his broomstick after Dementors\ninvade the field. His Nimbus 2000 is blown away and smashed by the Whomping\nWillow, a violent tree in the grounds. Afterward, Professor Lupin teaches\nHarry how to defend himself from Dementors using the Patronus charm. Harry\nuses The Marauder's Map (a map of Hogwarts marking all its inhabitants and\nsecret tunnels given to him by Fred and George Weasley) for an unauthorised\nvisit to the magical village of Hogsmeade. Harry overhears some of his\nteachers and Fudge and learns Black was a friend of Harry's parents and was\nentrusted with the secret of their whereabouts when they hid from Voldemort.\nHowever, he betrayed the Potters, leading to their murder by Voldemort's hand.\nFinally, Black killed twelve Muggles and his former friend Peter Pettigrew\nbefore being taken to Azkaban.

However, the relationship cannot\nbe avoided. But there is one strange thing. I have a lot of memories of wounds\nI have received from others, but I have no memories of the wounds I have given\nto others. In short, the demand and supply of \"shuttle\" do not match. Maybe\nit's caused by more unintended injuries. Maybe there are people who hurt\nothers in their own existence. Maybe the memory of the wound I got was a self-\ninflicted scratch. A three-member family waits for the signal in front of the\ncrosswalk. The man and woman with a seven-year-old girl in the middle are\nlaughing hahaha. Someone who rush into a secondhand bookstore as if to avoid\nthem. I don't know what to do because I can't get rid of myself. Maybe it's\nbecause of that. A book that's been pushed out from the inside of the book is\nfalling off. a pink letter found in the book On the back of the letter is the\naddress of Belle Epoque. Jo Eun, who will be her new housemate, goes to Belle\nEpoque with her letter.\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main cast (Belle Epoque)\n\n  * Han Ye-ri as Yoon Jin-myung \u2013 29-years-old\n  * Han Seung-yeon as Jung Ye-eun \u2013 23-years-old\n  * Park Eun-bin as Song Ji-won \u2013 23-years-old\n  * Ji Woo as Yoo Eun-jae \u2013 21-years-old\n  * Choi Ara as Jo Eun \u2013 21-years-old\n\n### The men around the Belle Epoque\n\n  * Kim Min-seok as Seo Jang-hoon\n  * Son Seung-won as Im Sung-min\n  * Shin Hyun-soo as Yoon Jong-yeol\n  * Lee Yoo-jin as Kwon Ho-chang\n  * An Woo-yeon as Heimdall / Lee Jin-kwang\n\n### Others\n\n  * Shin Se-hwi as Ahn Ye-ji\n  * Choi Bae-young as Song Kyung-ah\n  * Ha Eun-seol as Han Yoo-kyung\n  * Jo Byung-gyu as Jo Chung-han\n  * Go Min-si as Oh Ha-na\n\n### Cameo appearances\n\n  * Ryu Hwa-young as Kang Yi-na\n  * Yoon Park as Park Jae-wan\n  * Ji Il-joo as Go Doo-young\n  * PENTAGON as members of idol group Asgard\n    * Jinho as Baldr / Choi Jin-ho\n    * Shinwon as Ur / Kim Shin-won\n    * Yeo One as Tyr / Shin Chang-goo\n    * Yuto as Odin\n    * Kino as Freyr\n    * Wooseok as Thor / Park Woo-seok\n  * A.C.E as members of idol group The Fifth Column\n  * Z.Hera\n\n## Production\n\n  * Originally, it was expected that all five main roles would be the same from the previous season. However, early on Ryu Hwa-young was removed from the main cast. Instead a new character, Jo Eun, was created to fill in the five person dynamic of the show. Park Hye-soo was also supposed to be part of the main cast, but due to a scheduling conflict, she stepped down from the role. Unlike Ryu Hwa-young, this happened late into pre-production and so the character, Yoo Eun-jae, stayed and the role was taken on by actress Ji Woo instead.\n  * Onew was originally cast in the role of Kwon Ho-chang, but he stepped down in light of controversy surrounding him ten days before the drama's premiere, and was replaced with Lee Yoo-jin.\n\n## Ratings\n\n  * In this table, represent the lowest ratings and represent the highest ratings.\n  * N/A denotes that the rating is not known.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Hello, My Twenties! 2 at Daum\n\n",

      "# Sunshine on My Shoulders\n\n\"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" (sometimes titled simply \"Sunshine\") is a song\nrecorded and co-written by American singer-songwriter John Denver. It was\noriginally released as an album track on 1971's Poems, Prayers & Promises and\nlater, as a single in 1973. It went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100\nchart in the U.S. in early 1974.\n\n## Song history\n\nDenver described how he wrote \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\": \"I wrote the song in\nMinnesota at the time I call 'late winter, early spring'. It was a dreary day,\ngray and slushy. The snow was melting and it was too cold to go outside and\nhave fun, but God, you're ready for spring. You want to get outdoors again and\nyou're waiting for that sun to shine, and you remember how sometimes just the\nsun itself can make you feel good. And in that very melancholy frame of mind I\nwrote 'Sunshine on My Shoulders'.\" The song was slightly remixed for single\nrelease, with the addition of strings and woodwinds to enhance the background\nof the song. The album version features an extra verse, not heard on the\nSingles charts, due to the song's length. In addition to Denver's wondering on\nif he had a day and a song. In the second verse, It mentions Denver's\nwondering if he had a tale, and a wish. The song ends with the words \"ALMOST\nALWAYS\", being held on until the song's end. The full length single mix with\nthe second verse has been released on most of Denver's hits compilations. It\nwas originally the B-side of one of his earlier songs, \"I'd Rather Be a\nCowboy\". As the Vietnam War came to an end, the song took on a new\nsignificance and began to receive airplay on adult contemporary radio\nstations. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on January 26, 1974\nand moved into the number one spot nine weeks later, remaining at #1 for one\nweek. The song also topped the adult contemporary chart for two weeks in 1974.\nBillboard ranked it as the No. 18 song for 1974.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * John Denver \u2013 6 & 12-string acoustic guitars, vocals\n  * Mike Taylor \u2013 acoustic guitar\n  * Richard Kniss \u2013 double bass\n  * Frank Owens \u2013 piano\n\nThe song also features strings and winds, including oboes.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nA 2 1/2-hour made-for-television movie titled Sunshine, which aired on NBC in\n1973, used the song as a theme. The movie starred Cliff DeYoung and Cristina\nRaines. It told the story of a young mother dying from cancer. High ratings\nprompted a TV series (also Sunshine) which ran for three months during the\nsummer of 1974. The short-lived series began where the movie left off with the\nyoung widowed father (DeYoung) raising his stepdaughter (Elizabeth Cheshire).\nIn the John Denver Biopic Take Me Home: The John Denver Story (2000) it is\nplayed when Denver (Chad Lowe) takes his new glider out for a Test flight.\nThis final scene is based on the real life event that killed Denver in 1997.\nThe 1996 re-recorded version is the one played.\n\n## Chart performance\n\n## Carly Rae Jepsen version\n\nThe song was covered by Canadian singer/songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen as the\nlead single from her debut studio album, Tug of War, released on June 16,\n2008.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of RPM number-one singles of 1974\n  * List of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1974 (U.S.)\n  * List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1974 (U.S.)\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, Billboard Books, 9th edition, 2010,\n\n## External links\n\n",

Kip Chapman, Jacqueline Joe, Byron\nColl and Cohen Holloway also reprise their Top of the Lake roles in a\nflashback sequence, with Mark Leonard Winter appearing as Johnno.\n\n## Production\n\n### Top of the Lake\n\nActress Jennifer Ehle auditioned for the role of GJ, which went to Holly\nHunter. Jane Campion originally offered the role of Robin to Anna Paquin, who\nhad worked with her on The Piano (1993). Paquin declined due to her pregnancy,\nand the role went to American Elisabeth Moss. The series was originally\nintended as a co-production with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. But\nafter Moss was cast as Robin, the network pulled their funding before\nproduction began, citing a prior agreement to put an Australian actress in the\nlead. Australian-based channel UKTV, owned by BBC Worldwide, filled the\nfunding gap left by the ABC. Philippa Campbell was the New Zealand-based\nproducer. Filming took 18 weeks and was shot entirely on location in\nQueenstown and Glenorchy, in Otago, on the South Island of New Zealand. While\nQueenstown is referred to during the series, Glenorchy doubles as the\nfictitious town of Laketop. The scenes in the women's commune were filmed at\nMoke Lake.\n\n### Top of the Lake: China Girl\n\nIn early 2013, co-creator Jane Campion said that Top of the Lake comes to a\ndistinct ending, and there would be no additional series. Despite this, it was\nannounced in October 2014 that the series had been renewed for a second\nseason. China Girl began shooting on location in Sydney, Australia in December\n2015. Campion returned as co-writer and co-director. Gerard Lee returned as\nco-writer. The original co-director, Garth Davis, was replaced by Ariel\nKleiman due to scheduling conflicts. Philippa Campbell returned as producer.\nActress Nicole Kidman joined the cast for China Girl, which is the second time\nshe has worked with Campion. Kidman \"plays an Australian mother, Julia, whose\nstory dovetails with that of Detective Robin Griffin\", played by Elisabeth\nMoss. Christie, a fan of Campion's The Piano, joined the cast after sending a\nletter through a mutual friend.\n\n## Release\n\nTop of the Lake screened in its entirety at the January 2013 Sundance Film\nFestival, in a single seven-hour session with one intermission and a break for\nlunch. This was the first such screening in the history of the festival. Top\nof the Lake was additionally shown at the 63rd Berlin International Film\nFestival. The US premiere was on the Sundance Channel on 18 March 2013, in\nAustralia on BBC UKTV on 24 March 2013, and in New Zealand on 25 March, also\non BBC UKTV. China Girl was screened in its entirety at the May 2017 Cannes\nFilm Festival. In the UK, it premiered on BBC Two on 27 July 2017, and the\nentire series was released on the BBC iPlayer immediately afterwards. In the\nUS, it premiered in September 2017, on Sundance TV, and each episode will be\navailable on Hulu the day after its screening on SundanceTV. In Canada, China\nGirl premiered on 25 October 2017, on CBC Television.\n\n## Episodes\n\n### Series 1\n\n### Series 2: China Girl\n\n## Reception\n\nReviews of Top of the Lake have been positive, referring to the series as\n\"masterfully made\", \"beautiful\", \"mysterious\", \"riveting\", and \"a\nmasterpiece\". It received a score of 86 out of 100 from Metacritic and a score\nof 93 per cent from Rotten Tomatoes. There were also some less positive\nreviews. Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized the \"elaborately\nintroduced plotlines\" and described Tui's disappearance as \"less a story\nelement than a metaphor for the kind of armed resistance to male hegemony that\nconstitutes the central idea of Ms Campion\u2019s body of work.\" Top of the Lake\nwas praised for exploring rape culture, gender dynamics and the experiences of\nsingle women.\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\n#### AACTA Awards\n\n#### British Academy Television Craft Awards\n\n#### Critics' Choice Television Awards\n\n#### Emmy Awards\n\n#### Golden Globe Awards\n\n#### Golden Nymph Awards\n\n#### Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\n#### New Zealand Film Awards\n\n#### Screen Producers Australia Awards\n\n#### Equity Ensemble Awards\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Top of the Lake at the SundanceTV\n  * Top of the Lake at the BBC\n  * Top of the Lake: China Girl at the BBC\n\n"

      "# Mantaro River\n\nThe Mantaro River (, ) is a long river running through the central region of\nPeru. Its Quechua name means \"great river\". The word \"Mantaro\" may be a word\noriginally from the Ashaninka language, who live downstream along the Ene\nRiver. The Mantaro, along with the Apurimac River, are the sources of the\nAmazon River, depending on the criteria used for definition.\n\n## Geography\n\nThe river nominally has its source at Lake Junin at a height of 4,080 m, but\ntributaries above Lake Junin extend as much as 70 km farther upstream, for a\ntotal length of 808 km. The named tributaries of the river are the Cunas which\nenters the Mantaro at regional capital Huancayo, and the Kachimayu which flows\nnear the city of Ayacucho. The upper Mantaro is 417 km long extending from\nLake Junin to the Kachimayu inflow while the lower river shown on the map is\n307 km long. The river runs through the provinces Jun\u00edn, Yauli, Jauja,\nConcepci\u00f3n and Huancayo in the Jun\u00edn Region, then through the Huancavelica\nRegion and the Ayacucho Region. The river then returns to the Jun\u00edn Region in\nSatipo Province, where it unites with the Apurimac River to form the Ene\nRiver. Its hydrographic basin also includes some of the Pasco Region. The\nriver belongs to the hydrographic basin of the Amazon River. Its principal\ntributaries are the Cunas River, the Vilca/Moya River, the Ichhu River, and\nthe Kachimayu. The river runs from northeast to southeast through the Mantaro\nValley. This valley is the most important food source for the capital Lima.\nThe Mantaro Hydroelectric Complex is located in the Tayacaja Province of the\nHuancavelica Region, and produces 31% of all electrical energy generated in\nPeru. The first complete paddling descent of the river from the source was\naccomplished by Rocky Contos and James Duesenberry in May 2012. Previously,\nthe lower 140 km of the river were descended in kayak and later cataraft by\nRichard Pethigal in 2002. The lower section of the river is known for Sendero\nLuminoso camps.\n\n## Source of the Amazon\n\nIn 1971, an expedition led by the National Geographic Society cited the\nApur\u00edmac River as the designated headwaters of the Amazon River, with a\nfollow-up expedition in 2000 confirming the connected Lake Ticlla Cocha as the\nfurthest upstream Amazon extension. The definition for the distinction used at\nthe time of survey was based on absolute length which the tributary added to\nthe river, given a continuous and year-round flow of water. With the\nTablachaca Dam built in 1974, a portion of the Mantaro River suffers a dry\nspell for five months of the year, previously excluding it from the list of\nsource eligibility. However, research published in 2014 challenged this\nexisting definition, and used advanced imaging and topographic data to\nestablish the Mantaro as the true longest upstream source feeding into the\nAmazon Basin. The new measurements add approximately 75\u201392 km to the original\nAmazon River length.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Kuntur Sinqa\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Bless the Beasts and Children (song)\n\n\"Bless the Beasts and Children\" is the theme song to the 1971 eponymous film\nand was performed by the Carpenters. It was featured on the B-side to their\nhit, \"Superstar\". The B-side charted on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually\ntopping out at #67. In order to promote it, The Carpenters performed it on\ntheir television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, as \"F\" for \"Film Music\".\nIt was nominated for a 1972 Academy Award for Best Song, but it lost to Isaac\nHayes' \"Theme from Shaft\". The original soundtrack included two different\nversions of \"Bless the Beasts and Children\", the other being an orchestral\ninstrumental arrangement by composers Barry DeVorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr.,\nand the original \"Nadia's Theme\", which was listed as \"Cotton's Dream\".\n\"Cotton's Dream\" was also used as the theme song to the 1973 soap opera, The\nYoung and the Restless, and later \"Bless the Beasts and Children\" was used\nwhen David Hasselhoff's character, Dr. \"Snapper\" Foster, had to say goodbye to\nhis son in a dramatic 1982 episode of the series. The song was originally\nreleased on the original soundtrack, and a slightly different version was\nreleased on the Carpenters' 1972 LP, A Song for You on June 13, 1972. The\noriginal soundtrack had a vibraphone playing the melody in the introduction,\nwhile the A Song for You version, released on the single, contained an oboe\nstating the melody. The two versions (soundtrack and album versions) faded out\ntoward the end, but in 1985, Richard Carpenter re-mixed the song so it does\nnot fade out in the end. He also added a harder bass-line. Barry De Vorzon\ncomposed the song at a residence in Lake Arrowhead, California, where he used\nto spend his weekends, after director Stanley Kramer gave him the screenplay\nof the film. At first he wrote a \"beautiful melody\" and then \"loaded the lyric\nwith all the terrible things we're doing to children and animals,\" but it \"did\nnot work.\" The next day he change them to simpler lyrics that call to protect\ntheir innocence.\n\n## Chart history\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Karen Carpenterlead and backing vocals\n  * Richard Carpenterbacking vocals, piano, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer electric piano, orchestration\n  * Joe Osbornbass guitar\n  * Hal Blainedrums\n  * Tony Pelusoelectric fuzz guitar\n  * Earl Dumleroboe, English horn\n  * Uncreditedvibraphone, tambourine, temple blocks\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career 3-point scoring leaders\n\nA three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a\nfield goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a\ndesignated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three\npoints, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-\npoint line. The members on this list are the top 25 in 3-point field goals\nmade in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I\ncompetition. The statistic was first recognized in the 1986\u201387 season when\n3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA. From the 1986\u201387\nseason through the 2007\u201308 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for\nboth men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's\nbasketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the\nmen's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original\ndistance until it was moved to match the then-current men's distance effective\nin 2011\u201312. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend\nthe men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019\u201320 in\nDivision I and 2020\u201321 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remains at 20\nft 9 in. The all-time leader in three-point field goals made is Fletcher Magee\nof Wofford. In his four-year career from 2015 to 2019, he made 509 threes in\n1,169 attempts (43.5%). The career record for three-point attempts is held by\nTravis Bader of Oakland, who had held the record for made threes before Magee\nbroke it in the first round of the 2019 NCAA tournament. Bader attempted 1,246\nthrees in his career, making 504. Only one player in the top 25 all-time\nearned his way onto this list in only three seasons: Stephen Curry of Davidson\nplayed from 2006\u201307 through 2008\u201309 but left for the National Basketball\nAssociation (NBA) after his junior season. Curry also played in the fewest\ngames (104) out of all of the other players in the top 25 and currently ranks\n12th all-time. Four players split their collegiate careers at two schools\napiece: Keith Veney, who made 409 threes, first played at Lamar before\ntransferring to Marshall; Akeem Richmond, who made 416, started at Rhode\nIsland before transferring to East Carolina; Rotnei Clarke, who made 389,\nplayed three seasons at Arkansas before transferring to Butler for his final\nseason; and Andrew Rowsey, who made 404 while playing two seasons apiece at\nUNC Asheville and Marquette.

    "question": "Hot-dip galvanized metals have been covered with a thin sheet of?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Galvanization\n\nGalvanization or galvanizing (also spelled galvanisation or galvanising) is\nthe process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent\nrusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which the parts are\nsubmerged in a bath of molten hot zinc.\n\n## Protective action\n\nGalvanizing protects the underlying iron or steel in the following main ways:\n\n  * The zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying steel or iron.\n  * The zinc protects iron by corroding first. For better results, application of chromates over zinc is also seen as an industrial trend.\n  * In the event the underlying metal becomes exposed, protection can continue as long as there is zinc close enough to be electrically coupled. After all of the zinc in the immediate area is consumed, localized corrosion of the base metal can occur.\n\n## History and etymology\n\nThe earliest known example of galvanized iron was encountered by Europeans on\n17th-century Indian armour in the Royal Armouries Museum collection. The\netymology of galvanisation is via French from the name of Italian scientist\nLuigi Galvani. However this is an obscure back-formation; Galvani had no\ninvolvement in zinc coating. The earliest use of the term was in late 18th-\ncentury scientific research and medical practice by Galvani and meant the\nstimulation of a muscle by the application of an electric current. Although\nGalvani was the first to study this, it was Alessandro Volta who then\ndeveloped a better understanding of its cause and effect. Galvani's\nexplanation of 'animal electricity' as a cause was replaced by Volta's\ninvention of the electric battery and its use to stimulate animal tissue.\nDespite the superseding of his experimental results, it was Galvani's name\nrather than Volta's which became associated with the field. The term\n\"galvanized\" continues to be used metaphorically of any stimulus which results\nin activity by a person or group of people, such as to \"galvanize into action\"\nmeaning stimulating a complacent person or group to take action. In modern\nusage, the term \"galvanizing\" has largely come to be associated with zinc\ncoatings, to the exclusion of other metals. Galvanic paint, a precursor to\nhot-dip galvanizing, was patented by Stanislas Sorel, of Paris, in December\n1837, as an adoption of a term from a highly fashionable field of contemporary\nscience, despite having no evident relation to it.\n\n## Methods\n\nHot-dip galvanizing deposits a thick, robust layer of zinc iron alloys on the\nsurface of a steel item. In the case of automobile bodies, where additional\ndecorative coatings of paint will be applied, a thinner form of galvanizing is\napplied by electrogalvanizing. The hot-dip process generally does not reduce\nstrength on a measurable scale, with the exception of high-strength steels\n(>1100 MPa) where hydrogen embrittlement can become a problem. This deficiency\nis a consideration affecting the manufacture of wire rope and other highly-\nstressed products. The protection provided by hot-dip galvanizing is\ninsufficient for products that will be constantly exposed to corrosive\nmaterials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these\napplications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made\ntoday are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many\noutdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip zinc coating and looks\ngood when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip zinc coating is that for\nbolts and nuts of size M10 (US 3/8\") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating\nfills in too much of the threads, which reduces strength (because the\ndimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to\nfit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light\nmechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating bolts and\nnuts is not hot-dip zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless\nsteel or (stronger but much more expensive) titanium. The size of crystallites\n(grains) in galvanized coatings is a visible and aesthetic feature, known as\n\"spangle\". By varying the number of particles added for heterogeneous\nnucleation and the rate of cooling in a hot-dip process, the spangle can be\nadjusted from an apparently uniform surface (crystallites too small to see\nwith the naked eye) to grains several centimetres wide. Visible crystallites\nare rare in other engineering materials, even though they are usually present.\nThermal diffusion galvanizing, or Sherardizing, provides a zinc diffusion\ncoating on iron- or copper-based materials. Parts and zinc powder are tumbled\nin a sealed rotating drum. Around , zinc will diffuse into the substrate to\nform a zinc alloy. The advance surface preparation of the goods can be carried\nout by shot blasting. The process is also known as \"dry galvanizing\", because\nno liquids are involved; this can avoid possible problems caused by hydrogen\nembrittlement. The dull-grey crystal structure of the zinc diffusion coating\nhas a good adhesion to paint, powder coatings, or rubber. It is a preferred\nmethod for coating small, complex-shaped metals, and for smoothing rough\nsurfaces on items formed with sintered metal.\n\n## Eventual corrosion\n\nAlthough galvanizing will inhibit attack of the underlying steel, rusting will\nbe inevitable after some decades' exposure to weather, especially if exposed\nto acidic conditions. For example, corrugated iron sheet roofing will start to\ndegrade within a few years despite the protective action of the zinc coating.\nMarine and salty environments also lower the lifetime of galvanized iron\nbecause the high electrical conductivity of sea water increases the rate of\ncorrosion, primarily through converting the solid zinc to soluble zinc\nchloride which simply washes away. Galvanized car frames exemplify this; they\ncorrode much faster in cold environments due to road salt, though they will\nlast longer than unprotected steel. Galvanized steel can last for many decades\nif other supplementary measures are maintained, such as paint coatings and\nadditional sacrificial anodes. The rate of corrosion in non-salty environments\nis caused mainly by levels of sulfur dioxide in the air. In the most benign\nnatural environments, such as inland low population areas, galvanized steel\ncan last without rust for over 100 years.\n\n## Galvanized construction steel\n\nThis is the most common use for galvanized metal, and hundreds of thousands of\ntons of steel products are galvanized annually worldwide. In developed\ncountries most larger cities have several galvanizing factories, and many\nitems of steel manufacture are galvanized for protection. Typically these\ninclude: street furniture, building frameworks, balconies, verandahs,\nstaircases, ladders, walkways, and more. Hot dip galvanized steel is also used\nfor making steel frames as a basic construction material for steel frame\nbuildings.\n\n## Galvanized piping\n\nIn the early 20th century, galvanized piping replaced previously-used cast\niron and lead in cold-water plumbing. Typically, galvanized piping rusts from\nthe inside out, building up layers of plaque on the inside of the piping,\ncausing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques\ncan flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic\ntaste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 70 years, but it may\nvary by region due to impurities in the water supply and the proximity of\nelectrical grids for which interior piping acts as a pathway (the flow of\nelectricity can accelerate chemical corrosion). Pipe longevity also depends on\nthe thickness of zinc in the original galvanizing, which ranges on a scale\nfrom G40 to G210, and whether the pipe was galvanized on both the inside and\noutside, or just the outside. Since World War II, copper and plastic piping\nhave replaced galvanized piping for interior drinking water service, but\ngalvanized steel pipes are still used in outdoor applications requiring\nsteel's superior mechanical strength. The use of galvanized pipes lends some\ntruth to the urban myth that water purity in outdoor water faucets is lower,\nbut the actual impurities (iron, zinc, calcium) are harmless. The presence of\ngalvanized piping detracts from the appraised value of housing stock because\npiping can fail, increasing the risk of water damage. Galvanized piping will\neventually need to be replaced if housing stock is to outlast a 50 to 70 year\nlife expectancy, and some jurisdictions require galvanized piping to be\nreplaced before sale. One option to extend the life expectancy of existing\ngalvanized piping is to line it with an epoxy resin.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Cathodic protection\n  * Corrugated galvanized iron\n  * Galvanic corrosion\n  * Galvannealed - galvanization and annealing\n  * Prepainted metal\n  * Rust\n  * Rustproofing\n  * Sendzimir process\n  * Sherardizing\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n    * American Galvanizers Association\n    * Galvanizers Association\n    * Galvanizers Association Ireland\n\n"

      "# Skippy (dog)\n\nSkippy (also known as Asta, born 1931 or 1932; retired 1941) was a Wire Fox\nTerrier dog actor who appeared in dozens of movies during the 1930s. Skippy is\nbest known for the role of the pet dog \"Asta\" in the 1934 detective comedy The\nThin Man, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Due to the popularity of the\nrole, Skippy is sometimes credited as Asta in public and in other films.\n\n## Career\n\nSkippy was trained by his owners Henry East and Gale Henry East, and also by\nFrank Weatherwax, and assistant trainers Rudd Weatherwax, and Frank Inn. In\n1936, Skippy and several other movie dogs were profiled in the book Dog Stars\nof Hollywood by Gertrude Orr. At the time Skippy was said to be four and a\nhalf years old, giving him a birth year of 1931\u201332. He was said to be one of\nthe most intelligent of animal stars then working in pictures. In addition to\nverbal commands, he also worked to hand cues, essential for a dog performing\nin sound films. His training began when he was three months old, and he made\nhis first professional film appearances at the age of one year, in 1932\u201333, as\na bit player providing \"atmosphere.\" In Orr's book Skippy was shown in a\nseries of publicity shots with Wendy Barrie in It's a Small World, Mae Clarke\nin The Daring Young Man and Mary Carlisle in an unidentified film. He became a\nstar overnight in The Thin Man (1934). Skippy also made a hit as \"Mr. Smith\"\nin the 1937 film The Awful Truth, in which his character was the subject of a\ncustody dispute between characters portrayed by Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.\n(In a gaffe, Cary Grant wrestles and plays with \"Mr. Smith\" but can be heard\ndistinctly calling him \"Skippy\".) In Bringing Up Baby (1938), Skippy played\n\"George,\" the bone-hiding pup belonging to Katharine Hepburn's aunt. In Topper\nTakes a Trip (1938), he was \"Mr. Atlas\". The American Magazine detailed\nSkippy's professional life in an August 1938 profile of the East kennels,\ntitled \"A Dog's Life in Hollywood\": At a time when most canine actors in\nHollywood films earned $3.50 a day, Skippy's weekly salary was $250.00.\n\n### The Thin Man\n\nAs a character in the movie The Thin Man, Asta was the playful pet dog of Nick\nand Nora Charles, tugging them around town on his walks, hiding from danger,\nand sniffing out corpses. (\"Asta, you're not a terrier, you're a police dog,\"\nNick tells him.) The character later appeared in the sequels After the Thin\nMan, Another Thin Man, Shadow of the Thin Man, The Thin Man Goes Home, Song of\nthe Thin Man, as well as the 1950s television show The Thin Man. Loy wrote\nthat the actors were not allowed to interact with Skippy between takes; the\nEasts felt it would break his concentration. Skippy once bit Loy during\nfilming. The original character of Asta in Dashiell Hammett's book of The Thin\nMan was not a male Wire-Haired Fox Terrier, but a female Schnauzer. Due to the\nenormous popularity of the Asta character as played by Skippy, interest in pet\nterriers skyrocketed. Asta's enduring fame is such that the name is a frequent\nanswer in The New York Times crossword puzzles (crosswordese), in response to\nclues such as \"Thin Man dog\" or \"Dog star.\" Skippy played Asta in the first\nthree Thin Man films. Other terriers, trained by the Weatherwax family and by\nFrank Inn, took on the role in subsequent films of the series, and in the\ntelevision show.\n\n## Filmography\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Into Thin Air\n\nInto Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster is a 1997\nbestselling non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It details Krakauer's\nexperience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were\nkilled and several others were stranded by a storm. Krakauer's expedition was\nled by guide Rob Hall. Other groups were trying to summit on the same day,\nincluding one led by Scott Fischer, whose guiding agency, Mountain Madness,\nwas perceived as a competitor to Hall's agency, Adventure Consultants.\n\n## Summary\n\nKrakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to\nparticipate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given\nup mountain climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded eight\ndeaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Andy Harris. This was the third-\nhighest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the April\n2015 Nepal earthquake caused the most at 21. Krakauer, a journalist for the\nadventure magazine Outside, said initially his intention to climb Everest was\npurely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb\nonly to base camp, and report on the commercialization of the mountain.\nHowever, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the\nmountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he\ncould train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between\nevents that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes\nplace during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that\nessential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on\nEverest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding\nagencies, in order to get their clients to the summit.\n\n## Controversy\n\nKrakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the climb has generated criticism,\nboth from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such\nas Galen Rowell. Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's\naccounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide Anatoli Boukreev. An\nexperienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev\ndescended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their\nsafety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted\nrepeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer\nacknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions\nhis judgment, his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary\noxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients.\nBoukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his book, The Climb.\nGalen Rowell criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in\nhis narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while\nBoukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions\nwere nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: \"[Boukreev] foresaw\nproblems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak\n[Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond\nto an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.\" The account has also been\ncriticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving\naccurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance. In\nKrakauer's 1999 paperback edition of Into Thin Air, he addresses some of the\ncriticism in a lengthy postscript.\n\n## Adaptation\n\nFilm rights for Into Thin Air were purchased by Sony almost immediately after\nthe book's publication. The book was adapted into the TV movie (1997),\nstarring Peter Horton as Scott Fischer and Christopher McDonald as Jon\nKrakauer. The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial\nviewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film\ndiffers sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility. The 2015\nfilm Everest, by director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur, depicts the same events as the\nbook, with actor Michael Kelly portraying Krakauer. According to Korm\u00e1kur, it\nis not based on Krakauer's book.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n  * After the Wind, a 2014 book by Lou Kasischke\n  * The Climb, a 1997 book by Anatoli Boukreev\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n## External links\n\n  * Into Thin Air -- the original article by Jon Krakauer published in Outside magazine in September 1996 (saved by Archive.org)\n  * Interview with Peter Horton on the TV Movie\n  * NPR interview with Jon Krakauer, May 1996\n\n",

Some of the songs in question included modest hits\nsuch as \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Operator\". Holloway was planning to release her\nlong-awaited second album, Hurtin' & Cryin, which had released \"Just Look What\nYou've Done\" as the leading track, but for unknown reasons the record was\nshelved. Along with her sister Patrice, using music provided by Frank Wilson\nand with additional help from Gordy himself, Holloway co-wrote \"You've Made Me\nSo Very Happy\". Coincidentally, Holloway recorded the song after a breakup\nwith a boyfriend.\n\n### Release and reaction\n\nReaction to the song was stronger than Holloway's previous offerings, rising\nto number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her third Top-40 pop\nsingle. It peaked at number 40 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart. Shortly\nafter its release, Holloway left Motown and the song was eventually featured\non her \"second\" album, The Artistry of Brenda Holloway. After two more years\nsinging background for acts such as Joe Cocker, Holloway retired to marry a\npreacher and have a family. By the mid-1990's, she had returned to music full-\ntime. Meanwhile, her song got a boost when the jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat &\nTears covered it in 1969. It became one of the group's biggest hits, reaching\nnumber 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in April 1969 The song\nwas kept from the number 1 spot by Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In by The 5th\nDimension.

      "# Pro Kabaddi League\n\nThe Pro Kabaddi League, currently known as Vivo Pro Kabaddi League for\nsponsorship purpose, is a professional-level kabaddi league in India. It was\nlaunched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star Sports. The league's inception was\ninfluenced by the popularity of the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian\nGames. The format of the competition was influenced by Indian Premier League.\nThe Pro Kabaddi League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was\nheld in 2014 with eight teams each of which having paid fees of up to\nUS$250,000 to join. There were doubts over whether the PKL would be\nsuccessful, noting that there were many leagues attempting to emulate the\nIPL's business model and success, and that unlike cricket, there were\nrelatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was also noted\nthat kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community settings, and could\nthus attract a wide variety of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers\nto target if the league gained significant traction. The inaugural season was\nseen by 435 million viewers, second to the 2014 Indian Premier League's 552\nmillion, while the first season final between Jaipur Pink Panthers and U-Mumba\nwas watched by 86.4 million. Star Sports, the PKL's broadcaster, subsequently\nannounced in 2015 that it would acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent\ncompany Mashal Sports. For the 2017 and 2018-19 season, the PKL added four new\nteams, and changed its format to split the teams into two divisions known as\n\"zones\". Soon the league returned to its regular double round-robin format for\nthe 2019 season.\n\n## Format\n\nThe PKL's rules are similar to that of the indoor team version of Kabaddi, but\nwith additional rules to encourage more scoring. Playing two \"empty\" raids in\na row will trigger a \"do-or-die raid\", where the raider must score a point or\nthey will be declared out. When a defensive side has three or fewer players\nremaining, tackles are scored as a \"Super Tackle\", which is worth two points\ninstead of one.\n\n## Seasons\n\nSeason 1:\n\nThe first signing and auction of players for the 8 teams was held on 20 May\n2014 in Mumbai. India's national kabaddi captain Rakesh Kumar was the priciest\namong the players bought for 12.80 lakh by the Patna Pirates. Sports Authority\nof India's Deepak Niwas Hooda was bought by Telugu Titans franchise for 12.60\nlakh. Tae Deok Eom was the highest paid overseas player bought for 7 lakh by\nPatna franchise. The duration of the season was from 26 July 2014 to 31 August\n2014. There were double round-robin matches along with two semifinals, third\nplace and final games. 56 games were to be played in first round and 4 in\nplayoff stage, making total of 60 games. 8 teams took part in first edition.\nFirst game was played on July 26 between U Mumba and Jaipur Pink Panthers and\nthe final was played on August 31 at Mumbai. Jaipur Pink Panthers beat U Mumba\nby 35-24 to win the inaugural Pro Kabaddi League.\n\nSeason 2:\n\nStar Sports Pro Kabaddi season 2 was from 18 July 2015 to 23 August 2015.\nThere were 60 matches played with two semifinals, a third place play-off and a\nfinal. First game was played on July 18 between U Mumba and Jaipur Pink\nPanthers and the final was played on August 23 at Mumbai between U Mumba and\nBengaluru Bulls. U Mumba beat Bengaluru Bulls by 36-30 to win the 2015 season\nof Pro Kabaddi League. U Mumba stood first, Bengaluru Bulls stood second and\nTelugu Titans stood on third position in the league.\n\nSeason 3:\n\nStar Sports Pro Kabaddi season 3 will have two editions. The CEO of Star\nIndia, Sanjay Gupta, confirmed that Star Sports Pro Kabaddi wants to make Pro\nKabaddi, a 5-week event, happen 10 weeks a year by having two editions a year.\nThe idea is to play the tournament once in January\u2013February 2016 and once in\nJune\u2013July 2016. It also had 8 teams. Patna Pirates beat U Mumba by 3 points in\nthe final in Delhi to take home the trophy. Puneri Paltan came third this\nseason.\n\nSeason 4:\n\nThe fourth season took place from June 25 to July 31, 2016, with the existing\neight teams participating. Patna Pirates beat Jaipur Pink Panthers in the\nfinal. Season 4 also saw the launch of first professional women's kabaddi\nleague, Women's Kabaddi Challenge (WKC). First season saw 3 teams namely Ice\nDivas, Fire Birds and Storm Queens battle it out to be the first ever WKC\nchampions. In the final, scheduled along with the men's final in Hyderabad,\nthe Storm Queens defeated the Fire Birds.\n\nSeason 5:\n\nThe 2017 season was the fifth edition of the Pro Kabaddi League, and it\nfeatured 12 teams, including new teams from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil\nNadu, and Gujarat. The team from Haryana is known as Haryana Steelers owned by\nJSW Sports. Sachin Tendulkar co-owns the Tamil Nadu team named Tamil\nThalaivas. The Uttar Pradesh team is named as UP Yoddha owned by GMR group and\nthe Gujarat team is named as Gujarat Fortune Giants owned by Gautam Adani.\nAuctions for the new season were held in May, before which the existing teams\nwere allowed to retain one player each. The auction saw over 400 players go\nunder the hammer and Rs 46.99 crores spent by the 12 teams. The Pro Kabaddi\nLeague season 5 started on July 28, 2017.

      "# 2015 AFC Champions League group stage\n\nThe 2015 AFC Champions League group stage was played from 24 February to 6 May\n2015. A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places\nin the knockout stage of the 2015 AFC Champions League.\n\n## Draw\n\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 11 December 2014, 16:00 , at the\nPetaling Jaya Hilton Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 32 teams were drawn\ninto eight groups of four. Teams from the same association could not be drawn\ninto the same group. The following 32 teams (16 from West Zone, 16 from East\nZone) were entered into the group stage draw, which included the 24 automatic\nqualifiers and the eight qualifying play-off winners, whose identity was not\nknown at the time of the draw:\n\n## Format\n\nIn the group stage, each group was played on a home-and-away round-robin\nbasis. The winners and runners-up of each group advanced to the round of 16.\n\n### Tiebreakers\n\nThe teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a\ndraw, 0 points for a loss). If tied on points, tiebreakers are applied in the\nfollowing order:\n\n  1. Greater number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  2. Goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  3. Greater number of goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  4. Greater number of away goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  5. If, after applying criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 10 apply;\n  6. Goal difference in all the group matches;\n  7. Greater number of goals scored in all the group matches;\n  8. Penalty shoot-out if only two teams are involved and they are both on the field of play;\n  9. Fewer score calculated according to the number of yellow and red cards received in the group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);\n  10.

      "# List of One Day International cricket records\n\nOne Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket\nteams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well\nas the top four Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one\ninning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per\ninnings \u2013 although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is\nList-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward\nList-A records. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between\nEngland and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000\nODIs played by 26 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased,\npartly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and\npartly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue\nwith the increased popularity of cricket, a process that dates from the time\nof the Packer Revolution. The most successful team in ODI cricket, in terms of\nwin percentage (barring the Asia XI cricket team who have only played seven\ngames) is South Africa, who overtook previous leaders Australia in 2017, and\nas of 16 July 2018 have a record of 63.69%. In contrast, two teams have failed\nto win a single ODI: East Africa and Oman, though they have only played seven\nODIs between them. The trend of countries to increase the number of ODI\nmatches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern\nplayers, though this trend is reversing as teams play more Twenty20\nInternationals. Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in\nODIs with a total of 18,426. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is the\nhighest ODI wicket-taker with a total of 534 wickets. The record for most\ndismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka while\nthe record for most catches by a fielder is held by Sri Lankan Mahela\nJayawardene.\n\n## Listing criteria\n\nIn general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a\ntie for the last place among the five, when all the tied record holders are\nnoted).\n\n## Listing notation\n\nTeam notation\n\n  * (300\u20133) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets and the innings was closed, either due to a successful run chase or if no overs remained (or are able) to be bowled.\n  * (300) indicates that a team scored 300 runs and was all out, either by losing all ten wickets or by having one or more batsmen unable to bat and losing the remaining wickets.\n\nBatting notation\n\n  * (100*) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was not out.\n  * (175) indicates that a batsman scored 175 runs and was out after that.\n\nBowling notation\n\n  * (5\u201340) indicates that a bowler has captured 5 wickets while giving away 40 runs.\n  * (49.5 overs) indicates that a team bowled 49 complete overs (each of six legal deliveries), and one incomplete over of just five deliveries.\n\nCurrently playing\n\n  * Record holders who are currently playing ODIs (i.e. their record details listed could change) are shown by \u2021.\n\nSeasons\n\n  * Cricket is played during the summer months in most countries. Domestic cricket seasons in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and the West Indies may therefore span two calendar years, and are by convention said to be played in (e.g.) \"2008\u201309\". A cricket season in England is described as a single year. e.g. \"2009\". An international ODI series or tournament may be for a much shorter duration, and Cricinfo treats this issue by stating \"any series or matches which began between May and September of any given year will appear in the relevant single year season and any that began between October and April will appear in the relevant cross-year season\". In the record tables, a two-year span generally indicates that the record was set within a domestic season in one of the above named countries.\n\n## Team records\n\n### Team wins, losses, ties, and no results\n\n### Result records\n\n#### Greatest win margin (by runs)\n\n#### Greatest win margin (by balls remaining)\n\n#### Most consecutive wins\n\n#### Most consecutive defeats\n\n### Team scoring records\n\n#### Highest innings totals\n\n#### Highest match aggregate\n\n#### Highest run chases\n\n#### Lowest innings totals\n\n#### Most sixes in an innings\n\n#### Lowest total defended successfully\n\n## Individual records (Batting)\n\n### Most career runs\n\n### Most career runs \u2013 progression of record\n\n!

      "# Royal Troon Golf Club\n\nRoyal Troon Golf Club is a links golf course in Scotland, located in Troon,\nSouth Ayrshire, southwest of Glasgow.\n\n## Founding and early years\n\nThe club, which now has a total of 45 holes, was founded in 1878, initially\nwith five holes. It lies adjacent to the Firth of Clyde. George Strath was\nappointed in 1881 as the club's first golf professional, and together with\n1882 Open champion Willie Fernie (golfer), designed the original course,\nexpanding it to 18 holes by 1888. The two were assisted by Charlie Hunter,\ngreenskeeper of the neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club, in Troon's formative\nyears. When Strath left the Club's employ in 1887, Fernie became head\nprofessional, and served in that role until his death in 1924. He laid out the\nclub's original Portland Course as well; this course was named in honour of\nthe 6th Duke of Portland, an essential early Troon Golf Club patron and\nfacilitator, who was one of the region's largest landowners. The Club's\nproperty lies between the Firth of Clyde on the west, a caravan park on the\nsouth (slightly further south lies Prestwick Golf Club), the railway line and\nmain road on the east, and the town of Troon on the north. Glasgow Prestwick\nAirport is located slightly to the south and east of the club, and low-flying\naircraft are nearest its southern section.\n\n## Redesigned for first Open Championship\n\nJust prior to Royal Troon hosting its first Open Championship in 1923, the Old\nCourse was redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid, a five-\ntime Open champion, one of the era's top architects, and a member of the World\nGolf Hall of Fame. Other than having new back tees on several holes, the\ncurrent Old Course is essentially very similar to Braid's finished work.\n\n## Awarded 'Royal' designation\n\nTroon was granted its \"Royal\" designation in 1978, during its centennial. Its\nclubhouse is richly decorated with historical golf artifacts. James\nMontgomerie, father of champion golfer Colin Montgomerie, served as Secretary\nin the 1980s.\n\n## Nine-time host of The Open Championship\n\nIts Old Course is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of\nthe major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The Club has hosted\nthe Open nine times, the most recent in 2016.\n\n## Past Open champions\n\nPast Open champions at Royal Troon include Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia,\nTom Watson, Tom Weiskopf, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Locke, and Arthur Havers. Six\nconsecutive Opens at Troon were won by Americans, from 1962 through 2004,\nended by Henrik Stenson of Sweden in 2016.\n\n## Noteworthy characteristics\n\n### Seaside opening\n\nThe Old Course begins alongside the sea, running southwards in a line for the\nfirst six holes. This opening section offers full visibility and plenty of\nspace, but does still require accuracy to avoid deep bunkers. Many good rounds\nhave been fashioned through low scores here, often aided by prevailing\ndownwind conditions.\n\n### Rise in complexity\n\nBeginning with the seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while\nsimultaneously changing direction, on each of its next six holes, among\nhillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely\npunish offline shots. This sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and\n11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes.\n\n### Long finish\n\nWith the 13th hole, the player turns northwards for a long, very stern finish,\nrunning parallel to the opening stretch. This comprises three long par 4s, two\ntough par 3s, and a challenging par 5 (the 16th) with its fairway bisected at\nthe halfway point by a ditch, which can only very rarely be carried from the\ntee. The player very often has to face a strong prevailing wind.\n\n### Famous holes\n\nRoyal Troon is home to both the longest and shortest holes in Open\nChampionship golf. Regarded as one of the top holes in the world, the par-3\n8th hole (\"Postage Stamp\") measures a scant , but its diminutive green\nmeasures a mere . Two holes earlier, the par-5 6th (\"Turnberry\") extends to a\nlengthy . The 11th hole (\"The Railway\") is one of the most difficult holes in\nmajor championship golf. Now a long par-4, a blind tee shot has a long carry\nover gorse with out of bounds all along the railway on the right. The lengthy\napproach shot is to a small green that falls away, with nearby out of bounds.\n\n## Votes to admit women as members\n\nOn 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into\nthe club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have\novershadowed the 2016 Open Championship, and potentially to the club being\nremoved from the Open rota in the future.\n\n## The Portland and Craigend Courses\n\nThe Old Course is the championship layout at Royal Troon. Its second course,\nthe Portland, also an 18-hole layout from 1895, but significantly shorter than\nthe Old Course, was redesigned in 1921 by world-renowned architect Dr. Alister\nMacKenzie, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The Portland is also of\nvery high standard. It is located slightly further inland and mostly further\nnorth than the Old Course, with no holes bordering the Firth of Clyde; it has\nits own clubhouse. The Craigend Course is a nine-hole par-3 course. The Club\nis private; guests are allowed at certain times, under advance booking, with a\nhandicap certificate establishing proficiency. The Old Course has four tees \u2013\n\"Ladies\", \"Short\", \"Medal\" and \"Championship\".\n\n## Layout\n\nFor 2016 Open Championship: Lengths of the course for previous Opens (since\n1950):\n\n  * 2004: , par 71\n  * 1997: , par 71\n  * 1989: , par 72\n  * 1982: , par 72\n\n  * 1973: , par 72\n  * 1962: , par 72\n  * 1950: , par 70\n\nOpens from 1962 through 1989 played the 11th hole as a par-5.\n\n## The Open Championship\n\nThe Open Championship has been held at Troon on nine occasions:\n\n  * Note: For multiple winners of The Open Championship, superscript ordinal identifies which in their respective careers.\n\n## Women's British Open\n\nThe Women's British Open has been held at Troon on one occasion:\n\n## Hosts further significant events\n\n  * Royal Troon has hosted the Amateur Championship on five occasions: 1956, 1968, 1978, 2003, and 2012.\n  * The Club hosted the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship on four occasions: 1904, 1925, 1952, and 1984.\n  * The Club hosted the Senior Open Championship in 2008, and American Bruce Vaughan won.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Amateur on six occasions: 1923, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1977 and 2009.\n  * The Club hosted the Scottish Ladies' Amateur on five occasions: 1907, 1949, 1957, 1963, and 1982.\n  * The Club is schedule to host the AIG Women's British Open in 2020.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * The Open Championship \u2013 official site\n\n"

The film stars Sam Worthington,\nRosamund Pike, Bill Nighy, \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Toby Kebbell, Danny Huston, Ralph\nFiennes, and Liam Neeson, with Jonathan Liebesman directing a screenplay by\nDan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson. Wrath of the Titans takes place a decade\nafter the events of the preceding film as the gods lose control over the\nimprisoned Titans (thanks to humanity's lack of prayers which also is draining\ntheir immortality) and Perseus is called, this time to rescue his father Zeus,\noverthrow the Titans, and save mankind. Talk of a sequel began with the\nrelease of Clash of the Titans in March 2010. Scribes Dan Mazeau and David\nLeslie Johnson were hired in June 2010 and director Jonathan Liebesman was\nbrought on board in August 2010. The majority of the casting took place\nbetween January and February 2011. Principal photography began in London in\nMarch 2011. Like its predecessor, the film was converted to 3D in post-\nproduction. Wrath of the Titans was released in 2D and 3D on March 30, 2012 in\nthe United States. The film received widespread negative reception from\ncritics and grossed $305 million worldwide. A sequel entitled Revenge of the\nTitans was planned for a 2013 release, but was cancelled due to the two films'\ncritical failures and too few ideas for the script.\n\n## Plot\n\nPerseus (Sam Worthington), the demigod son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), now lives as\na fisherman after the death of his wife, Io (portrayed by Gemma Arterton in\nthe previous film) with his young son, Heleus (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus\nand asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a\nresult the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal, they can no longer\nsustain the walls of Tartarus, which are crumbling and the imprisoned Titan\nKronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get\ninvolved. Zeus meets his brothers, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny\nHuston) and his son, Ares (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in\nrebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus.\nAres betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and\nAres plan to make a deal with Kronos; in exchange for remaining immortal, they\nwill drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break,\nunleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his\nvillage, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon\nwho informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his demigod son\nAgenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into\nTartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries\nhe sustained when meeting Hades. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and Agenor\nset out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus\ncreated three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's\nthunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, and that these weapons\ncan jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos.\nAfter an encounter with Cyclopes, the travelers eventually meet the now mortal\nHephaestus (Bill Nighy) and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to\nTartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable\nPerseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth. Once inside the\nlabyrinth they encounter a Minotaur that attacks the group, but Perseus\nmanages to kill it. The group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has\nbeen almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to\nHades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has\nforgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in\ncontrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the former's revival. Perseus\narrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades' pitchfork, allowing\nPerseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.\nAiming to retrieve Zeus' thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos,\nPerseus challenges him to a duel. Ares accepts. Meanwhile, Andromeda's army is\noverwhelmed by the Makhai. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the\ncreatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromeda's army. Zeus and\nHades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares eventually killing him with the\nthunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus\ndestroys Kronos by traveling to its heart and throwing the spear into it. Zeus\nreconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades tells Perseus that\nnow he is powerless and leaves. Perseus kisses Andromeda, and Heleus tells his\nfather that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells\nhim they can't. Perseus encourages Heleus to be proud of himself, as he is the\nson of Perseus and the grandson of Zeus. The film ends with Perseus giving his\nsword to Heleus.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Sam Worthington as Perseus, the demigod son of Zeus, who defeated the Kraken and saved humanity; Zeus enlists Perseus' help in order to defeat the Titan Kronos.\n  * Liam Neeson as Zeus, the god of the sky and ruler of Mount Olympus, Perseus' father.\n  * Ralph Fiennes as Hades, the god of the underworld, who makes a deal with Kronos.\n  * Rosamund Pike as Andromeda, who was saved by Perseus when she was a princess; now crowned Queen of Argos, she joins Perseus in his quest to defeat Kronos.

Tamer\nHassan, who played Ares in the first film, stated at the film's world premiere\nthat, \"They want this one to do well so they can go ahead with the sequel,\nReturn of the Gods\". In April 2010 it was reported that director Louis\nLeterrier would not return to direct, but would be an executive producer on\nthe second installment. The report also stated that Sam Worthington was on\nboard and that Greg Berlanti would write the story. In June 2010, Warner Bros.\nhired screenwriters David Leslie Johnson and Dan Mazeau to write the\nscreenplay, with Basil Iwanyk returning as the producer. Rather than being\nconverted to 3D, it was announced that the sequel would be filmed in 3D. In\nAugust 2010, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Jonathan Liebesman had\nsigned a deal to direct the sequel. In September 2010, director Jonathan\nLiebesman confirmed that Sam Worthington, Gemma Arterton, Ralph Fiennes, and\nLiam Neeson would be returning. However, Arterton did not reprise her role for\nunknown reasons, leaving her character, Io, dead in the film, which means the\nsequel must have been directed with the original intended ending for the first\nfilm which did not see her revived, as was the case with the final cut. In\nDecember 2010, Neeson revealed that the film would be titled Wrath of the\nTitans and that filming was expected to begin next March. In January 2011, it\nwas reported that \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez and Toby Kebbell were in negotiations to play\nAres and Agenor respectively. It was also reported that Bill Nighy was being\ncourted to play Hephaestus. Additionally, Hayley Atwell was on the shortlist\nof actresses screen testing for the role of Andromeda, played in the previous\nfilm by Alexa Davalos who left due to a scheduling conflict. Other actresses\nbeing considered for Andromeda included Georgina Haig, Janet Montgomery,\nDominique McElligott, and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy. In February 2011, it was reported\nthat Rosamund Pike was near a deal for the part. Also in February, Liebesman\nannounced that Wrath of the Titans would be converted to 3D rather than shot\nin 3D as previously reported despite the negative criticism the first Clash of\nthe Titans received for its use of post-conversion 3D. Liebesman explained, \"I\nthink what you have to remember is the first film was neither shot nor edited\nwith 3D in mind. It was shot as a 2D movie and edited as a 2D film, and they\ndecided to convert it with six or seven weeks to go until release, which is\ninsane; the technology was not there. That's why we're conceiving it from the\nstart, from the ground up, in 3D, editing in 3D for 3D.\" Liebesman also stated\nthe reason behind the conversion was because he wants to shoot on film, which\nwill give the film's imagery better texture than he would get shooting\ndigitally. Principal photography began on March 23, 2011. Filming took place\nin studios outside London and later shot on location in Surrey, South Wales\nand in the Canary Islands on the island of Tenerife and Torres del Paine\nNational Park in Chilean Patagonia.\n\n## Release\n\nWrath of the Titans premiered on Monday, March 26, 2012 at the AMC Lincoln\nSquare Theater in New York City.\n\n### Home media\n\nWrath of the Titans was released on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD and digital\ndownload on June 26, 2012.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nWrath of the Titans earned $83.6 million in North America and $221.6 million\ninternationally for a worldwide total of $305.2 million, less than the $493\nmillion grossed by its predecessor. The film was co-financed by Warner Bros.\nand Legendary Pictures for $150 million, about $25 million more than it cost\nto produce the original. It debuted day-and-date in 61 markets worldwide sans\nJapan and delivered a global opening of $110.3 million. In the United States\nand Canada, the film was released in a total of 3,545 theaters with 2,900 3D\nlocations (4,400 3D screens), and 290 IMAX locations. Initially, it was\nprojected open around with $35\u201340 million. It opened Friday, March 30, 2012\nwith $1 million from midnight screenings in 1,490 theaters. The film went on\nto earn $34.2 million in North America over the weekend, finishing in second\nplace behind The Hunger Games which was playing its second weekend. The\nopening is over half of the original's $61.2 million debut. It played well in\nIMAX representing $4.7 million of the total weekend's gross. Not surprisingly,\nthe follow-up attracted a large male contingent on its opening weekend with\n66%. Roughly 65% of the moviegoers \u2013 about 55% of whom were over the age of 25\n\u2013 saw the film in 3D. Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of domestic\ndistribution, said the comparison between the opening of the first and second\nfilm was not fair because the original opened on Good Friday, when more\nteenagers were out on spring break. He lamented on the film's poor box office\nperformance saying, \"we made a decision to open a week before the holiday this\ntime and generate positive word-of-mouth since we had issues with the last one\nregarding the 3-D conversion, we're gonna get there \u2013 we're just gonna get\nthere in a different way.\" However, despite not opening on a holiday weekend,\nthe film had the advantage of playing a week before Easter in which the\ncompany could avail the spring break, which was staggered over the next two\nweeks. However, all this didn't necessarily aid the film's further box office\nperformance. Warner Bros. said they didn't expect the sequel to reach the same\nlevel. Outside North America, the film had a more successful opening but this\nsuccess later dwindled due to poor word of mouth and eventually was unable to\ntopple the first film's final $332 million international gross. It opened in\nfirst place \u2013 dethroning The Hunger Games \u2014 with $76.1 million from 14,600\nscreens (9,766 of which were in 3D) in 60 territories. It debuted in first\nplace in 46 markets, notably in nine of the top 12 international territories\nincluding Korea ($4.3 million), France ($3.1 million) and Italy ($1.8\nmillion). Its biggest opening territories were Russia and the CIS ($12.8\nmillion, representing 18% of the total weekend foreign take), Mexico ($5.2\nmillion) and Brazil ($4.1 million). The film was ranked No. 1 in 11 markets\nacross Latin America. Also internationally, it had an IMAX opening of $4\nmillion from 176 screens \u2013 or $22,000 per site \u2013 with Russia contributing\nabout $55,000 per-screen at 19 IMAX locations.\n\n### Critical response\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 26% of 166 surveyed critics\ngave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.5/10. The site's\ncritical consensus reads, \"Its 3D effects are an improvement over its\npredecessor's, but in nearly every other respect, Wrath of the Titans fails to\nimprove upon the stilted acting, wooden dialogue, and chaos-driven plot of the\nfranchise's first installment\". Metacritic assigned the film an average score\nof 37 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\nreviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences\ngave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, slightly better\nthan the first film's \"B\" grade. The film earned a Razzie Award nomination for\nNeeson as Worst Supporting Actor. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter\ncalled it, \"A relentlessly mechanical piece of work that will not or cannot\ntake the imaginative leaps to yield even fleeting moments of awe, wonder or\ncharm\". Roger Ebert, who gave the first film three stars, awarded Wrath with\nonly two, remarking \"It lacks a comprehensible story, and you won't need your\nCliffsNotes on the Greek myths. You get an idea of who the major players are,\nand then they spend a modest amount of time shouting laughable dialogue at one\nanother while being all but forced off the screen by special effects.\". Mark\nOlsen of the Los Angeles Times criticized, \"Directed this time out by Jonathan\nLiebesman, the film lacks inspiration or zest in storytelling, performance or\naction. This is pure product, a movie desperately without energy or enthusiasm\nof any kind\". However, there have been some positive reviews. Andrew Barker of\nVariety noted that, \"The [Clash of the Titans] franchise has matured ever so\nslightly with Wrath of the Titans, hewing incrementally more faithfully to its\nGreek origins and trimming the fat in essential places\". Richard Corliss of\nTime magazine wrote, \"Wrath [of the Titans] radiates the straight-forward,\nstraight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics, like Hercules and Jason\nand the Argonauts, produced in Europe a half-century ago\". Owen Gleiberman of\nEntertainment Weekly commented, \"For a movie that's basically all warmed-over\npseudo-mythology and special effects, Wrath of the Titans is certainly more\nfun, in its solemnly junky way, than John Carter. It may also be a little more\nfun than its cheeseball predecessor, the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans\".\n\n## Cancelled sequel\n\nFollowing the film's release, a second sequel, called Revenge of the Titans,\nwas in the pipeline. However, due to Wraths disappointing critical reception\nand box office returns, the project was later shelved. In May 2013,\nWorthington stated he did not think a third film would be made. In December\n2013, producer Basil Iwanyk confirmed the sequel was not happening due to a\nlack of fresh ideas for the script.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Percussion section\n\nThe percussion section is one of the main divisions of the orchestra and the\nconcert band. It includes most percussion instruments and all unpitched\ninstruments. The percussion section is itself divided into three subsections:\n\n  * Pitched percussion, consisting of pitched instruments such as glockenspiel and tubular bells.\n  * Auxiliary percussion, consisting of all unpitched instruments such as snare drum and cymbals.\n  * Timpani.\n\nThese three subsections reflect the three main skill areas that a\npercussionist studies. Percussion sections, consisting of similar instruments,\nmay also be found in stage bands and other musical ensembles.\n\n## Tuned percussion\n\nThis subsection is traditionally called tuned percussion, however the\ncorresponding term untuned percussion is avoided in modern organology in\nfavour of the term unpitched percussion, so the instruments of this subsection\nare similarly termed pitched percussion. All instruments of this subsection\nare pitched, and with the exception of the timpani, all pitched instruments of\nthe percussion section are in this subsection. They include:\n\n  * All mallet percussion instruments, and keyboard percussion instruments such as the xylophone and tubular bells.\n  * Collections of pitched instruments such as hand bells, tuned cowbells and crotales.\n  * Most other melodic percussion instruments.\n\nDespite the name, keyboard percussion instruments do not have keyboards as\nsuch. Keyboard instruments such as the celesta and keyboard glockenspiel are\nnot included in the percussion section owing to the very different skills\nrequired to play them, but instead are grouped in the keyboard section with\ninstruments that require similar skills. Similarly, the timpani, although they\nare pitched percussion and are tuned by the player, are not included in the\ntuned percussion subsection owing to the particular skills expected of the\nplayer.\n\n## Auxiliary percussion\n\nAll unpitched percussion instruments are grouped into the auxiliary percussion\nsubsection, which includes an enormous variety of instruments, including\ndrums, cymbals, bells, shakers, whistles and even found objects. Players are\nexpected to be accomplished on the snare drum, bass drum, clash cymbals and\nother hand percussion, and to be able to adapt these skills to playing other\ninstruments and even objects, for example the typewriter.\n\n## Timpani\n\nThe timpanist is a specialist who does not usually perform on the other\npercussion instruments during a concert. A high level of skill unique to this\ninstrument is expected. While players of tuned and auxiliary percussion often\nplay many instruments from both subsections during a performance or piece, the\ntimpanist is normally dedicated to that instrument.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Classification of percussion instruments\n  * String section\n  * Woodwind section\n  * Brass section\n  * Keyboard section\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Wrath of the Titans\n\nWrath of the Titans is a 2012 3D fantasy action-adventure film that is a\nsequel to the 2010 film Clash of the Titans. The film stars Sam Worthington,\nRosamund Pike, Bill Nighy, \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Toby Kebbell, Danny Huston, Ralph\nFiennes, and Liam Neeson, with Jonathan Liebesman directing a screenplay by\nDan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson. Wrath of the Titans takes place a decade\nafter the events of the preceding film as the gods lose control over the\nimprisoned Titans (thanks to humanity's lack of prayers which also is draining\ntheir immortality) and Perseus is called, this time to rescue his father Zeus,\noverthrow the Titans, and save mankind. Talk of a sequel began with the\nrelease of Clash of the Titans in March 2010. Scribes Dan Mazeau and David\nLeslie Johnson were hired in June 2010 and director Jonathan Liebesman was\nbrought on board in August 2010. The majority of the casting took place\nbetween January and February 2011. Principal photography began in London in\nMarch 2011. Like its predecessor, the film was converted to 3D in post-\nproduction. Wrath of the Titans was released in 2D and 3D on March 30, 2012 in\nthe United States. The film received widespread negative reception from\ncritics and grossed $305 million worldwide. A sequel entitled Revenge of the\nTitans was planned for a 2013 release, but was cancelled due to the two films'\ncritical failures and too few ideas for the script.\n\n## Plot\n\nPerseus (Sam Worthington), the demigod son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), now lives as\na fisherman after the death of his wife, Io (portrayed by Gemma Arterton in\nthe previous film) with his young son, Heleus (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus\nand asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a\nresult the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal, they can no longer\nsustain the walls of Tartarus, which are crumbling and the imprisoned Titan\nKronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get\ninvolved. Zeus meets his brothers, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny\nHuston) and his son, Ares (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in\nrebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus.\nAres betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and\nAres plan to make a deal with Kronos; in exchange for remaining immortal, they\nwill drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break,\nunleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his\nvillage, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon\nwho informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his demigod son\nAgenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into\nTartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries\nhe sustained when meeting Hades. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and Agenor\nset out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus\ncreated three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's\nthunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, and that these weapons\ncan jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos.\nAfter an encounter with Cyclopes, the travelers eventually meet the now mortal\nHephaestus (Bill Nighy) and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to\nTartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable\nPerseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth. Once inside the\nlabyrinth they encounter a Minotaur that attacks the group, but Perseus\nmanages to kill it. The group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has\nbeen almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to\nHades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has\nforgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in\ncontrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the former's revival. Perseus\narrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades' pitchfork, allowing\nPerseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.\nAiming to retrieve Zeus' thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos,\nPerseus challenges him to a duel. Ares accepts. Meanwhile, Andromeda's army is\noverwhelmed by the Makhai. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the\ncreatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromeda's army. Zeus and\nHades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares eventually killing him with the\nthunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus\ndestroys Kronos by traveling to its heart and throwing the spear into it. Zeus\nreconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades tells Perseus that\nnow he is powerless and leaves. Perseus kisses Andromeda, and Heleus tells his\nfather that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells\nhim they can't. Perseus encourages Heleus to be proud of himself, as he is the\nson of Perseus and the grandson of Zeus. The film ends with Perseus giving his\nsword to Heleus.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Sam Worthington as Perseus, the demigod son of Zeus, who defeated the Kraken and saved humanity; Zeus enlists Perseus' help in order to defeat the Titan Kronos.\n  * Liam Neeson as Zeus, the god of the sky and ruler of Mount Olympus, Perseus' father.\n  * Ralph Fiennes as Hades, the god of the underworld, who makes a deal with Kronos.\n  * Rosamund Pike as Andromeda, who was saved by Perseus when she was a princess; now crowned Queen of Argos, she joins Perseus in his quest to defeat Kronos. Pike replaced Alexa Davalos in the role, due to a schedule conflict.\n  * Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, the fallen god, forger of the gods' weapons.\n  * \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez as Ares, the god of war, who betrays his father Zeus to join Hades.\n  * Danny Huston as Poseidon, the god of the sea, Agenor's father.\n  * Toby Kebbell as Agenor, the demigod son of Poseidon; he joins Perseus in his quest to defeat Kronos.\n  * John Bell as Helius, the young son of Perseus.\n  * Lily James as Korrina, a female soldier from Argos.\n  * Sinead Cusack as Clea, Helius' teacher and guardian in Perseus' absence.\n  * Martin Bayfield as the Cyclops Elder, who leads Perseus and his group to Hephaestus.\n  * Spencer Wilding as Minotaur, the ferocious creature who guards the labyrinth.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nTalks of a sequel to Clash of the Titans began as early as March 2010. Tamer\nHassan, who played Ares in the first film, stated at the film's world premiere\nthat, \"They want this one to do well so they can go ahead with the sequel,\nReturn of the Gods\". In April 2010 it was reported that director Louis\nLeterrier would not return to direct, but would be an executive producer on\nthe second installment. The report also stated that Sam Worthington was on\nboard and that Greg Berlanti would write the story. In June 2010, Warner Bros.\nhired screenwriters David Leslie Johnson and Dan Mazeau to write the\nscreenplay, with Basil Iwanyk returning as the producer. Rather than being\nconverted to 3D, it was announced that the sequel would be filmed in 3D. In\nAugust 2010, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Jonathan Liebesman had\nsigned a deal to direct the sequel. In September 2010, director Jonathan\nLiebesman confirmed that Sam Worthington, Gemma Arterton, Ralph Fiennes, and\nLiam Neeson would be returning. However, Arterton did not reprise her role for\nunknown reasons, leaving her character, Io, dead in the film, which means the\nsequel must have been directed with the original intended ending for the first\nfilm which did not see her revived, as was the case with the final cut. In\nDecember 2010, Neeson revealed that the film would be titled Wrath of the\nTitans and that filming was expected to begin next March. In January 2011, it\nwas reported that \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez and Toby Kebbell were in negotiations to play\nAres and Agenor respectively. It was also reported that Bill Nighy was being\ncourted to play Hephaestus. Additionally, Hayley Atwell was on the shortlist\nof actresses screen testing for the role of Andromeda, played in the previous\nfilm by Alexa Davalos who left due to a scheduling conflict. Other actresses\nbeing considered for Andromeda included Georgina Haig, Janet Montgomery,\nDominique McElligott, and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy. In February 2011, it was reported\nthat Rosamund Pike was near a deal for the part. Also in February, Liebesman\nannounced that Wrath of the Titans would be converted to 3D rather than shot\nin 3D as previously reported despite the negative criticism the first Clash of\nthe Titans received for its use of post-conversion 3D. Liebesman explained, \"I\nthink what you have to remember is the first film was neither shot nor edited\nwith 3D in mind. It was shot as a 2D movie and edited as a 2D film, and they\ndecided to convert it with six or seven weeks to go until release, which is\ninsane; the technology was not there. That's why we're conceiving it from the\nstart, from the ground up, in 3D, editing in 3D for 3D.\" Liebesman also stated\nthe reason behind the conversion was because he wants to shoot on film, which\nwill give the film's imagery better texture than he would get shooting\ndigitally. Principal photography began on March 23, 2011. Filming took place\nin studios outside London and later shot on location in Surrey, South Wales\nand in the Canary Islands on the island of Tenerife and Torres del Paine\nNational Park in Chilean Patagonia.\n\n## Release\n\nWrath of the Titans premiered on Monday, March 26, 2012 at the AMC Lincoln\nSquare Theater in New York City.\n\n### Home media\n\nWrath of the Titans was released on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD and digital\ndownload on June 26, 2012.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nWrath of the Titans earned $83.6 million in North America and $221.6 million\ninternationally for a worldwide total of $305.2 million, less than the $493\nmillion grossed by its predecessor. The film was co-financed by Warner Bros.\nand Legendary Pictures for $150 million, about $25 million more than it cost\nto produce the original. It debuted day-and-date in 61 markets worldwide sans\nJapan and delivered a global opening of $110.3 million. In the United States\nand Canada, the film was released in a total of 3,545 theaters with 2,900 3D\nlocations (4,400 3D screens), and 290 IMAX locations. Initially, it was\nprojected open around with $35\u201340 million. It opened Friday, March 30, 2012\nwith $1 million from midnight screenings in 1,490 theaters. The film went on\nto earn $34.2 million in North America over the weekend, finishing in second\nplace behind The Hunger Games which was playing its second weekend. The\nopening is over half of the original's $61.2 million debut. It played well in\nIMAX representing $4.7 million of the total weekend's gross. Not surprisingly,\nthe follow-up attracted a large male contingent on its opening weekend with\n66%. Roughly 65% of the moviegoers \u2013 about 55% of whom were over the age of 25\n\u2013 saw the film in 3D. Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of domestic\ndistribution, said the comparison between the opening of the first and second\nfilm was not fair because the original opened on Good Friday, when more\nteenagers were out on spring break. He lamented on the film's poor box office\nperformance saying, \"we made a decision to open a week before the holiday this\ntime and generate positive word-of-mouth since we had issues with the last one\nregarding the 3-D conversion, we're gonna get there \u2013 we're just gonna get\nthere in a different way.\" However, despite not opening on a holiday weekend,\nthe film had the advantage of playing a week before Easter in which the\ncompany could avail the spring break, which was staggered over the next two\nweeks. However, all this didn't necessarily aid the film's further box office\nperformance. Warner Bros. said they didn't expect the sequel to reach the same\nlevel. Outside North America, the film had a more successful opening but this\nsuccess later dwindled due to poor word of mouth and eventually was unable to\ntopple the first film's final $332 million international gross. It opened in\nfirst place \u2013 dethroning The Hunger Games \u2014 with $76.1 million from 14,600\nscreens (9,766 of which were in 3D) in 60 territories. It debuted in first\nplace in 46 markets, notably in nine of the top 12 international territories\nincluding Korea ($4.3 million), France ($3.1 million) and Italy ($1.8\nmillion). Its biggest opening territories were Russia and the CIS ($12.8\nmillion, representing 18% of the total weekend foreign take), Mexico ($5.2\nmillion) and Brazil ($4.1 million). The film was ranked No. 1 in 11 markets\nacross Latin America. Also internationally, it had an IMAX opening of $4\nmillion from 176 screens \u2013 or $22,000 per site \u2013 with Russia contributing\nabout $55,000 per-screen at 19 IMAX locations.\n\n### Critical response\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 26% of 166 surveyed critics\ngave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.5/10. The site's\ncritical consensus reads, \"Its 3D effects are an improvement over its\npredecessor's, but in nearly every other respect, Wrath of the Titans fails to\nimprove upon the stilted acting, wooden dialogue, and chaos-driven plot of the\nfranchise's first installment\". Metacritic assigned the film an average score\nof 37 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\nreviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences\ngave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, slightly better\nthan the first film's \"B\" grade. The film earned a Razzie Award nomination for\nNeeson as Worst Supporting Actor. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter\ncalled it, \"A relentlessly mechanical piece of work that will not or cannot\ntake the imaginative leaps to yield even fleeting moments of awe, wonder or\ncharm\". Roger Ebert, who gave the first film three stars, awarded Wrath with\nonly two, remarking \"It lacks a comprehensible story, and you won't need your\nCliffsNotes on the Greek myths. You get an idea of who the major players are,\nand then they spend a modest amount of time shouting laughable dialogue at one\nanother while being all but forced off the screen by special effects.\". Mark\nOlsen of the Los Angeles Times criticized, \"Directed this time out by Jonathan\nLiebesman, the film lacks inspiration or zest in storytelling, performance or\naction. This is pure product, a movie desperately without energy or enthusiasm\nof any kind\". However, there have been some positive reviews. Andrew Barker of\nVariety noted that, \"The [Clash of the Titans] franchise has matured ever so\nslightly with Wrath of the Titans, hewing incrementally more faithfully to its\nGreek origins and trimming the fat in essential places\". Richard Corliss of\nTime magazine wrote, \"Wrath [of the Titans] radiates the straight-forward,\nstraight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics, like Hercules and Jason\nand the Argonauts, produced in Europe a half-century ago\". Owen Gleiberman of\nEntertainment Weekly commented, \"For a movie that's basically all warmed-over\npseudo-mythology and special effects, Wrath of the Titans is certainly more\nfun, in its solemnly junky way, than John Carter. It may also be a little more\nfun than its cheeseball predecessor, the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans\".\n\n## Cancelled sequel\n\nFollowing the film's release, a second sequel, called Revenge of the Titans,\nwas in the pipeline. However, due to Wraths disappointing critical reception\nand box office returns, the project was later shelved. In May 2013,\nWorthington stated he did not think a third film would be made. In December\n2013, producer Basil Iwanyk confirmed the sequel was not happening due to a\nlack of fresh ideas for the script.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Sunshine on My Shoulders\n\n\"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" (sometimes titled simply \"Sunshine\") is a song\nrecorded and co-written by American singer-songwriter John Denver.

      "# Sunshine (American TV series)\n\nSunshine is a 1975 American television comedy-drama series starring Cliff\nDeYoung and Elizabeth Cheshire, about a hippie musician raising his young\ndaughter alone after the death of his wife. The series was based on the 1973\nmade-for-TV movie Sunshine and DeYoung, Bill Mumy, Corey Fischer, and Meg\nFoster all reprised their roles from the film. The series originally ran for\n13 episodes on NBC in the spring of 1975. The show's opening theme was John\nDenver's hit song \"Sunshine on My Shoulders.\"\n\n## Plot\n\nThree years after the death of his wife Kate (which occurred at the end of the\n1973 Sunshine film), musician Sam Hayden (Cliff DeYoung) is raising their\nyoung daughter Jill (Elizabeth Cheshire) as a single father. Sam struggles to\nmake ends meet by playing in a folk rock trio with Weaver (Bill Mumy) and\nGivits (Corey Fischer) and by doing various day jobs. Although Sam's\nresponsibilities leave little time for him to date women, he hopes to find one\nhe can love who will also be a good mother to Jill. Meanwhile, Weaver, Givits,\nand Sam's occasional girlfriend Nora (Meg Foster) pitch in to help Sam care\nfor Jill.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Cliff DeYoung as Sam Hayden\n  * Elizabeth Cheshire as Jill\n  * Bill Mumy as Weaver\n  * Corey Fischer as Givits\n  * Meg Foster as Nora\n\n## Episodes\n\n## Reception\n\nAlthough the series drew praise from critics for its quality and realism, its\ntimeslot forced it to compete for young viewers with the popular CBS series\nThe Waltons, and older viewers were not interested in watching a show about a\nhippie. A Chicago Tribune reviewer also blamed the series' failure on its\nportrayal of daughter Jill as an ill-mannered \"pest\". Sunshine performed\npoorly in the Nielsen ratings and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After its\ncancellation, the series was described as being \"before its time\" and \"one of\nthe most interesting failures\" of the season. Five episodes of Sunshine were\nlater combined into a feature-length movie called My Sweet Lady which was\nwidely circulated in England, Japan and Australia, resulting in the characters\nbecoming better known in those countries than they were in the United States.\nIn 1977, NBC took the unusual step of reuniting the original cast of the\ncancelled series for a two-hour holiday television film, Sunshine Christmas,\nwhich the network first aired on December 12, 1977. In the movie, Sam and Jill\nreturn to his native Texas to visit Sam's parents, and Sam rekindles a romance\nwith his high school sweetheart.\n\n## Book adaptation\n\nIn 1975, a novelization of the series by Norma Klein entitled The Sunshine\nYears was published. Klein had previously written the novelization of the\nSunshine film, and later did the same for Sunshine Christmas.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# You Are My Sunshine\n\n\"You Are My Sunshine\" is a song popularized by Jimmie Davis and Charles\nMitchell in 1939. It has been declared one of the state songs of Louisiana\nbecause of its association with Davis, a country music singer and governor of\nthe state in the years 1944\u20131948 and 1960\u20131964. The song has been covered\nnumerous times \u2014 so often, in fact, that it is \"one of the most commercially\nprogrammed numbers in American popular music.\" The song, originally country\nmusic, has \"virtually lost\" its original country music identity, and\n\"represent[s] both the national flowering of country music and its eventual\nabsorption into the mainstream of American popular culture.\" In 1941, it was\ncovered by Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Mississippi John Hurt, Wayne King and\nLawrence Welk. The versions by Autry, Crosby, and King reached the US charts\nof the day. In subsequent years, it was covered by Doris Day (1951), Nat King\nCole (1955), The Marcels (1961), Ray Charles (1962), Ike & Tina Turner, The\nRivingtons (1962), Andy Williams (1963), Burl Ives (1968), Frank Turner, The\nBeach Boys, Aretha Franklin, Anne Murray (1979), Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis,\nJohnny Cash, Norman Blake , Brian Wilson, Mouse and the Traps, Gene Vincent,\nJamey Johnson, Low, Mose Allison, Bryan Ferry, Carly Simon, Madeline Eastman,\nYusuf Islam, Copeland, Johnny and the Hurricanes, and Barbra Lica (2012),\namongst many others. The 1940 version by Davis has been added to the National\nRecording Registry in the Library of Congress on March 21, 2013, for long-term\npreservation. Virginia Shehee, a long-time Davis family friend and member of\nthe Louisiana State Senate from 1976 to 1980, introduced legislation to make\n\"You Are My Sunshine\" the official state song.\n\n## Early recordings\n\nTwo versions of \"You Are My Sunshine\" were recorded and released in 1939 prior\nto Jimmie Davis' version. The first was recorded for Bluebird Records (RCA-\nVictor's budget label) on August 22, 1939, by The Pine Ridge Boys (Marvin\nTaylor and Doug Spivey), who were from Atlanta. The second was recorded for\nDecca Records on September 13, 1939, by The Rice Brothers Gang. This group was\noriginally from north Georgia but relocated to Shreveport, where they were\nperforming on the radio station KWKH. The version by Jimmie Davis was recorded\nfor Decca Records on February 5, 1940.\n\n## Authorship\n\nWhile Davis and Mitchell are the credited songwriters of \"You Are My\nSunshine\", Davis was never known to actually claim authorship, as he bought\nthe song and rights from Paul Rice and put his own name on it, a practice not\nuncommon in the pre-World War II music business, though some early versions of\nthe song credit it to the Rice Brothers. Descendants and associates of Oliver\nHood, a LaGrange, Georgia, musician who collaborated with Rice, state that\nHood wrote the song in the early 1930s and first performed it at a Veterans of\nForeign Wars convention at LaGrange, Georgia, in 1933. According to OffBeat\nmagazine, clarinetist Pud Brown was also involved with the Rice Brothers for\nthe song's origin or first arrangement. Davis said that for some time he had\nbeen enthusiastic about the song and had unsuccessfully tried to convince\nrecord companies to record it before finally making his own 1940 record of the\nsong. Davis' version was popular and was followed by numerous other covers,\nincluding those of Bing Crosby and Gene Autry, whose versions made the number\na big hit. Davis emphasized his association with the song when running for\ngovernor of Louisiana in 1944, singing it at all his campaign rallies while\nriding on a horse named \"Sunshine\".\n\n## In popular culture\n\nFilm appearances\n\n* Take Me Back to Oklahoma (1940) \u2013 sung by Tex Ritter\n* Strictly in the Groove (1942) \u2013 sung by Jimmie Davis.\n* Meet Me in St. Gallen (2018) - sung by Moira Dela Torre\n* Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins (1975)\n* O Brother, Where Art Thou?

      "# Sunshine on My Shoulders\n\n\"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" (sometimes titled simply \"Sunshine\") is a song\nrecorded and co-written by American singer-songwriter John Denver. It was\noriginally released as an album track on 1971's Poems, Prayers & Promises and\nlater, as a single in 1973. It went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100\nchart in the U.S. in early 1974.\n\n## Song history\n\nDenver described how he wrote \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\": \"I wrote the song in\nMinnesota at the time I call 'late winter, early spring'. It was a dreary day,\ngray and slushy. The snow was melting and it was too cold to go outside and\nhave fun, but God, you're ready for spring. You want to get outdoors again and\nyou're waiting for that sun to shine, and you remember how sometimes just the\nsun itself can make you feel good. And in that very melancholy frame of mind I\nwrote 'Sunshine on My Shoulders'.\" The song was slightly remixed for single\nrelease, with the addition of strings and woodwinds to enhance the background\nof the song. The album version features an extra verse, not heard on the\nSingles charts, due to the song's length. In addition to Denver's wondering on\nif he had a day and a song. In the second verse, It mentions Denver's\nwondering if he had a tale, and a wish. The song ends with the words \"ALMOST\nALWAYS\", being held on until the song's end. The full length single mix with\nthe second verse has been released on most of Denver's hits compilations. It\nwas originally the B-side of one of his earlier songs, \"I'd Rather Be a\nCowboy\". As the Vietnam War came to an end, the song took on a new\nsignificance and began to receive airplay on adult contemporary radio\nstations. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on January 26, 1974\nand moved into the number one spot nine weeks later, remaining at #1 for one\nweek. The song also topped the adult contemporary chart for two weeks in 1974.\nBillboard ranked it as the No. 18 song for 1974.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * John Denver \u2013 6 & 12-string acoustic guitars, vocals\n  * Mike Taylor \u2013 acoustic guitar\n  * Richard Kniss \u2013 double bass\n  * Frank Owens \u2013 piano\n\nThe song also features strings and winds, including oboes.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nA 2 1/2-hour made-for-television movie titled Sunshine, which aired on NBC in\n1973, used the song as a theme. The movie starred Cliff DeYoung and Cristina\nRaines. It told the story of a young mother dying from cancer. High ratings\nprompted a TV series (also Sunshine) which ran for three months during the\nsummer of 1974. The short-lived series began where the movie left off with the\nyoung widowed father (DeYoung) raising his stepdaughter (Elizabeth Cheshire).\nIn the John Denver Biopic Take Me Home: The John Denver Story (2000) it is\nplayed when Denver (Chad Lowe) takes his new glider out for a Test flight.\nThis final scene is based on the real life event that killed Denver in 1997.\nThe 1996 re-recorded version is the one played.\n\n## Chart performance\n\n## Carly Rae Jepsen version\n\nThe song was covered by Canadian singer/songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen as the\nlead single from her debut studio album, Tug of War, released on June 16,\n2008.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of RPM number-one singles of 1974\n  * List of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1974 (U.S.)\n  * List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1974 (U.S.)\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, Billboard Books, 9th edition, 2010,\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Pro Kabaddi League\n\nThe Pro Kabaddi League, currently known as Vivo Pro Kabaddi League for\nsponsorship purpose, is a professional-level kabaddi league in India. It was\nlaunched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star Sports. The league's inception was\ninfluenced by the popularity of the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian\nGames. The format of the competition was influenced by Indian Premier League.\nThe Pro Kabaddi League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was\nheld in 2014 with eight teams each of which having paid fees of up to\nUS$250,000 to join. There were doubts over whether the PKL would be\nsuccessful, noting that there were many leagues attempting to emulate the\nIPL's business model and success, and that unlike cricket, there were\nrelatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was also noted\nthat kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community settings, and could\nthus attract a wide variety of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers\nto target if the league gained significant traction. The inaugural season was\nseen by 435 million viewers, second to the 2014 Indian Premier League's 552\nmillion, while the first season final between Jaipur Pink Panthers and U-Mumba\nwas watched by 86.4 million. Star Sports, the PKL's broadcaster, subsequently\nannounced in 2015 that it would acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent\ncompany Mashal Sports. For the 2017 and 2018-19 season, the PKL added four new\nteams, and changed its format to split the teams into two divisions known as\n\"zones\". Soon the league returned to its regular double round-robin format for\nthe 2019 season.\n\n## Format\n\nThe PKL's rules are similar to that of the indoor team version of Kabaddi, but\nwith additional rules to encourage more scoring. Playing two \"empty\" raids in\na row will trigger a \"do-or-die raid\", where the raider must score a point or\nthey will be declared out. When a defensive side has three or fewer players\nremaining, tackles are scored as a \"Super Tackle\", which is worth two points\ninstead of one.\n\n## Seasons\n\nSeason 1:\n\nThe first signing and auction of players for the 8 teams was held on 20 May\n2014 in Mumbai. India's national kabaddi captain Rakesh Kumar was the priciest\namong the players bought for 12.80 lakh by the Patna Pirates.

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places\nin the knockout stage of the 2015 AFC Champions League.\n\n## Draw\n\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 11 December 2014, 16:00 , at the\nPetaling Jaya Hilton Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 32 teams were drawn\ninto eight groups of four. Teams from the same association could not be drawn\ninto the same group. The following 32 teams (16 from West Zone, 16 from East\nZone) were entered into the group stage draw, which included the 24 automatic\nqualifiers and the eight qualifying play-off winners, whose identity was not\nknown at the time of the draw:\n\n## Format\n\nIn the group stage, each group was played on a home-and-away round-robin\nbasis. The winners and runners-up of each group advanced to the round of 16.\n\n### Tiebreakers\n\nThe teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a\ndraw, 0 points for a loss). If tied on points, tiebreakers are applied in the\nfollowing order:\n\n  1. Greater number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  2. Goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  3. Greater number of goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  4. Greater number of away goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned;\n  5. If, after applying criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 10 apply;\n  6. Goal difference in all the group matches;\n  7. Greater number of goals scored in all the group matches;\n  8. Penalty shoot-out if only two teams are involved and they are both on the field of play;\n  9.

      "# 2013 ICC Champions Trophy\n\nThe 2013 ICC Champions Trophy was a One Day International cricket tournament\nheld in England and Wales between 6 and 23 June 2013. Three cities hosted the\ntournament's matches: London (at The Oval), Birmingham (at Edgbaston) and\nCardiff (at Sophia Gardens, known as Cardiff Wales Stadium for the\ntournament). India won the competition, beating England by five runs in the\nfinal after overcoming South Africa, the West Indies and Pakistan in the group\nstage, followed by a semi-final victory over Sri Lanka. As winners, India\nearned $2 million in prize money, the largest amount since the tournament's\ninception. It was due to be the seventh and final ICC Champions Trophy, to be\nreplaced by the ICC World Test Championship in 2017, but in January 2014, it\nwas instead confirmed by the ICC that a Champions Trophy tournament would take\nplace in 2017, with the proposed Test Championship being cancelled.\n\n## Rules and regulations\n\nThe 2013 ICC Champions Trophy was contested by eight teams, which were seeded\nand divided into two groups. Each team played every other team in its group\nonce. Following the group stage, the top two teams from each group progressed\nto the semi-finals, where the winner of Group A played the runner-up of Group\nB and the winner of Group B played the runner-up of Group A.\n\n### Points system\n\n## Venues\n\n## Squads\n\n## Warm-up matches\n\nThe warm-up matches had rules that were slightly different from normal ODI\nmatches, so they are not recognised as ODIs. A team could use up to 15 players\nin a match, but only 11 could bat or field in each innings.\n\n## Group stage\n\n### Group A\n\nAdvanced to knock-out stage\n\n### Group B\n\nAdvanced to knock-out stage\n\n## Knock-out stage\n\n### Semi-finals\n\n### Final\n\n## Statistics\n\n### Batting\n\nMost runs\n\n### Bowling\n\nMost wickets\n\n## Controversy\n\nAustralian David Warner was suspended by Cricket Australia until the first\nAshes Test after an altercation with English batsman Joe Root following\nAustralia's loss to England. Former England captain Bob Willis accused one\nEnglish cricketer of tampering with the ball in order to aid reverse swing\nduring their match against Sri Lanka. Umpire Aleem Dar changed the ball midway\nthrough Sri Lanka's innings, but England coach Ashley Giles denied the\naccusations, saying that Dar changed the ball because it had gone out of\nshape.\n\n### Pitch invasion incident\n\nThe semi-final between India and Sri Lanka at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff saw\nindividuals, possibly Tamil Youth activists, running onto the pitch with flags\nof Tamil Eelam and banners protesting against the Sri Lankan team playing in\nthe United Kingdom. The first invasion occurred in the 50th over of the Sri\nLanka innings, but the two interlopers were soon overpowered by the security\nstaff. However, the second invasion saw at least six protesters run onto the\nfield from various angles from the River Taff End of the ground. The protests\ncontinued after the match had finished, and a fight broke out outside the\nground between protesters and supporters in a manner similar to the earlier\nprotests at a group stage game at The Oval. Later, hundreds of members of\nBritain's Tamil community held up the Sri Lankan team bus after the encounter\nand raised anti-Sri Lankan government slogans. No protests were shown to the\nIndian team and their bus left as scheduled.

      "# List of banana cultivars\n\nThe following is a list of banana cultivars and the groups into which they are\nclassified. Almost all modern cultivated varieties (cultivars) of edible\nbananas and plantains are hybrids and polyploids of two wild, seeded banana\nspecies, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. Cultivated bananas are almost\nalways seedless (parthenocarpic) and hence sterile, so they are propagated\nvegetatively (cloned). They are classified into groups according to a genome-\nbased system introduced by Ernest Cheesman, Norman Simmonds, and Ken Shepherd,\nwhich indicates the degree of genetic inheritance from the two wild parents\nand the number of chromosomes (ploidy). Cultivars derived from Musa acuminata\nare more likely to be used as dessert bananas, while those derived from Musa\nbalbisiana and hybrids of the two are usually plantains or cooking bananas.\n\n## Classification of cultivars\n\nBanana plants were originally classified by Linnaeus into two species, which\nhe called Musa paradisiaca \u2013 those used as cooking bananas (plantains), and M.\nsapientum \u2013 those used as dessert bananas. The primary center of diversity of\ncultivated bananas is Southeast Asia. Botanical exploration of this area led\nto many more species being named, along with subspecies and varieties.\nHowever, this approach proved inadequate to deal with the large number of\ncultivated varieties (cultivars) which were discovered, and many of the names\nlater proved to be synonyms. Furthermore, it was discovered that most\ncultivated bananas are actually hybrids between two wild species, M. acuminata\nand M. balbisiana, both first described in 1820 by the Italian botanist Luigi\nAloysius Colla, and that Linnaeus' two \"species\" were both this hybrid, which\nis now called M. \u00d7 paradisiaca. Unlike the wild species, which have seeds,\ncultivated bananas are almost always seedless (parthenocarpic) and hence\nsterile, so they have to be propagated vegetatively. In 1955, researchers\nNorman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed abandoning traditional Latin-based\nbotanical names for cultivated bananas. This approach foreshadowed the\nInternational Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants which, in addition to\nusing Latin names based on the International Code of Nomenclature for algae,\nfungi, and plants, gives cultivars names in a currently spoken language,\nenclosed in single quotes, and organizes them into \"cultivar groups\", also not\ngiven Latin names. Banana cultivars derived from M. acuminata and M.\nbalbisiana can be classified into cultivar groups using two criteria. The\nfirst is the number of chromosomes: whether the plant is diploid, triploid or\ntetraploid. The second is relationship to the two ancestral species, which may\nbe determined by genetic analysis or by a scoring system devised by Simmonds\nand Shepherd. A cultivar is scored on 15 characters, chosen because they\ndiffer between the two species. Each character is given a score between one\nand five according to whether it is typical of M. acuminata or of M. babisiana\nor is in between. Thus the total score for a cultivar will range from 15 if\nall characters agree with M. acuminata to 75 if all characters agree with M.\nbalbisiana. Intermediate scores suggest mixed ancestry: for example, 45 would\nbe expected for diploids with equal genetic contributions from both species.\nGroups are then named using a combination of the letters \"A\" and \"B\". The\nnumber of letters shows the ploidy; the proportion of As and Bs the\ncontributions of the ancestral species. The AAB Group, for example, comprises\ntriploid cultivars with more genetic inheritance from M. acuminata than M.\nbalbisiana. A character score of around 35 is expected for members of this\ngroup. Within groups, cultivars may be divided into subgroups and then given a\ncultivar name, e.g. Musa AAA Group (Cavendish Subgroup) 'Robusta'. In\npractice, the scoring system and the associated grouping is not as\nstraightforward as the Simmonds and Shepherd naming system implies. For\nexample, a member of the AAB Group should have a score about one third of the\nway between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana (i.e. about 35) if one third of its\nchromosomes come from M. balbisiana. However, the cultivars 'Silk' and 'Pome',\nboth classified in the AAB Group, scored 26 and 46 respectively. The cultivar\n'Pelipita' is placed in the ABB group, so should have 11 of its 33 chromosomes\nderived from M. acuminata. However, a technique called \"genomic in situ\nhybridization\" (GISH) showed that actually only 8 chromosomes were of this\norigin. Other lines of evidence suggest a more complex genome structure is\npresent in other banana cultivars, so the group names should not be taken at\nface value.\n\n## Cultivars\n\nThe total number of cultivars of bananas and plantains has been estimated to\nbe anything from around 300 to more than 1000. Names are highly confused, even\nwithin a single country. Many common names do not refer to a single cultivar\nor clone; for example 'Lady's Finger' or 'Lady Finger' has been used as the\nname for members of different genome groups, including AA and AAB. Many other\nnames are synonyms of cultivars grown in the same or different countries.\nAttempts have been made to create lists of synonyms. In 2000, Valmayor et al.\nlisted equivalent local names for 68 cultivars across five Southeast Asian\ncountries (the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam),\ntogether with their internationally used names. They considered a further 81\ncultivars to be unique to one country. In 2007, Ploetz et al. listed more\ncultivar names and synonyms, with an emphasis on those grown in the islands of\nthe Pacific, but including some grown in areas such as India, Africa and South\nAmerica. As an example, for the widely grown cultivar 'Dwarf Cavendish', they\ngave 58 synonyms from 29 different countries or geographical areas. ProMusa\nhas created a checklist of banana cultivar names based on available\nliterature. A recent development is the use of \"somaclones\" in banana\ncultivation. Micropropagation involves growing plants from very small amounts\nof source tissue, sometimes even a single cell, under sterile conditions using\nartificial techniques to induce growth. The purpose of micropropagation is\noften to produce a large number of genetically identical offspring. However,\nby inducing mutations through various means, it is possible to produce plants\nwhich differ slightly from the \"parent\" plant and from each other (\"somaclonal\nvariations\"). By growing on these somaclones and selecting those with\ndesirable features, new cultivars can be produced which are very similar to an\nexisting cultivar, but differ in one or two features, such as disease\nresistance. Somaclones may only be distinguishable by genetic analysis.\n\n### Musa section\n\nMusa \u00d7 paradisiaca is the name for hybrids between Musa acuminata (A) and Musa\nbalbisiana (B), both in the Musa section:\n\n#### AA Group\n\nDiploid Musa acuminata, both wild banana plants and cultivars\n\n  * Chingan banana\n  * Lacatan banana\n  * Lady Finger banana (Sugar banana)\n  * Pisang jari buaya (Crocodile fingers banana)\n  * Se\u00f1orita banana (Monkoy, Arnibal banana, Cuarenta dias, Cari\u00f1osa, Pisang Empat Puluh Hari, Pisang Lampung)\n  * Sinwobogi banana\n\n#### AAA Group\n\nTriploid Musa acuminata, both wild banana plants and cultivars\n\n  * Cavendish Subgroup\n    * 'Dwarf Cavendish'\n    * 'Giant Cavendish' ('Williams')\n      * Formosana (GCTCV-218), a variant with some resistance to Fusarium wilt TR4\n    * 'Grand Nain' ('Chiquita')\n    * 'Masak Hijau'\n    * 'Robusta'\n  * 'Red Dacca'\n  * Dwarf Red banana\n  * Flhorban 920\n  * Gros Michel banana\n  * East African Highland bananas (AAA-EA subgroup)\n\n#### AAAA Group\n\nTetraploid Musa acuminata, both wild bananas and cultivars\n\n  * Bodles Altafort banana\n  * Golden Beauty banana\n\n#### AAAB Group\n\nTetraploid cultivars of Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca\n\n  * Atan banana\n  * Goldfinger banana\n\n#### AAB Group\n\nTriploid cultivars of Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca.

It won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary\nChristian Music Performance/Song. \"What a Beautiful Name\" was released on 6\nJanuary 2017, as the lead single from their 25th live album, Let There Be\nLight (2016).\n\n## Background\n\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" was composed in December 2015 in Sydney, Australia,\nfor the upcoming Hillsong Conference, the annual church gathering. The\nscriptural foundation of the song can be found in , and .\n\n## Composition\n\nAccording to sheet music published at Sheetmusicdirect.com by Hillsong\nPublishing, \"What a Beautiful Name\" is a slow tempo of 68 beats per minute.\nWritten in common time, the song is in the key of D major. Brooke Ligertwood's\nvocal range spans from A to B during the song.\n\n## Music video\n\nA video for the song was recorded at the Hillsong Conference in Sydney and was\nreleased on 30 September 2016. The YouTube video has more than 340 million\nviews as of 30 December 2019.\n\n## Reception\n\nMusic critic Matt Collar praised Hillsong Worship for their \"passionate,\nfaith-based sound\" and wrote that fans of the group \"will surely appreciate\nthis emotive, uplifting Christian pop.\" Jake Gosselin attributes the\npopularity of the song in the Christian community to a number of factors. He\nwrites that \"What a Beautiful Name\" is \"singable.\" In practice this refers to\nthe \"small vocal range\" of the song which is \"one note over an octave.\" This\ntranslates to a song that is easy to sing and which does not strain the voice\nwith notes that are too high or too low. He also comments that the song is\nwritten in the key of D which is \"the optimal key for both men and women.\"\n\n### Chart performance\n\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" had its worldwide digital release on 6 January 2017,\nand topped Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart on 25 February. The single\nhas held the top position for 37 weeks making it the third-longest-leading No.\n1 in the 14-year history of the Hot Christian chart. The song which claims the\ndistinction as the longest-leading No. 1 is \"Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)\" and\nwas released by another Hillsong unit, Hillsong United. \"Oceans\" led the Hot\nChristian chart for 61 weeks. The song has stayed on the chart for 77 weeks,\nmaking it the third longest running song on the chart. \"What a Beautiful Name\"\nis ranked as the No. 1 song of the year for 2017 on the Christian Digital\nSales chart, No. 3 on Christian Streaming Songs, and is also the No. 3 song on\nChristian Airplay. The song spent nine weeks as No. 1 on Christian Airplay and\nwas Hillsong Worship's first No. 1 on the chart. What a Beautiful Name also\nleads the CCLI, the international licensing service for 250,000 churches.\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" is a track from Hillsong Worship's 25th live album,\nLet There Be Light. The album was released on 14 October 2016, and debuted as\nNo. 1 on the Top Christian Albums chart. For 2017, Let There be Light was\nranked the No. 9 of the year.\n\n### Awards and accolades\n\nHillsong Worship was named Billboard's Top Christian Artist of 2017, as well\nas Top Christian Duo/Group. \"What a Beautiful Name\" earned two Dove awards,\nSong of the Year and Worship Song of the Year. \"What a Beautiful Name\" won the\naward for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song at the 60th\nGrammy Awards, the first for Hillsong Worship.\n\n## Live performances\n\nThe song was recorded at a live performance at the annual Hillsong Conference\nin 2016. Hillsong performed the song at the 48th Annual Dove Awards held at\nAllen Arena in Nashville. The performance was well received and \"had audience\nmembers on their feet with their hands in the air.\" When asked about\nperforming the song in an interview with Billboards Jim Asker, Ligertwood said\nabout the audience: Finally, she said about performing the song:\n\n## Other versions\n\nIn July 2017, the Voices of Lee, the \"elite\" a cappella singing group, posted\na video of the song to their Facebook page. The cover was an instant hit and\nreached the so-called viral threshold of 5 million views in two days. As of\nOctober 2017, it had amassed 33 million views.

      "# Rhapis excelsa\n\nRhapis excelsa, also known as broadleaf lady palm or bamboo palm, is a species\nof fan palm (Arecaceae subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Trachycarpeae) in the\ngenus Rhapis, probably native to southern China and Taiwan. It is not known in\nthe wild; all known plants come from cultivated groups in China. They were\nfirst collected by the Japanese for Tokugawa shogunate palaces, then\npopularity spread to Europe, and later to America where its low light and\nhumidity requirements make it a common feature in malls and offices. The genus\nname is Greek - rhapis, meaning \"needle\"; and the species name is Latin for\n\"tall\", though R. excelsa is not the tallest in the genus.\n\n## Description\n\nRhapis excelsa grows up to 4 m in height and 30 mm in diameter in multi-\nstemmed clumps with glossy, palmate evergreen leaves divided into broad,\nribbed segments. Leaf segments are single or few in young plants and increase\nto a dozen or more in mature plants; segments are divided to the petiole.\nLeaf-ends are saw-toothed unlike most other palms, occurring on slender\npetioles ranging from 20 to 60 cm in length. New foliage emerges from a\nfibrous sheath which remains attached to the base. As the plants age, the\nsheaths fall, revealing the bamboo-like trunks. This usually dioecious palm\nspecies produces a small inflorescence at the top of the plant with spirally-\narranged, fleshy yellow flowers containing three petals fused at the base.\nRipe fruit are fleshy and white, though R. excelsa more readily propagates via\nunderground rhizome offshoots. In the UK this plant has gained the Royal\nHorticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit.\n\n## Gallery\n\n## References\n\n  * Moore, H. E., Jr. (1963).

      "# Gaylord Yost\n\nDr. Gaylord Yost (28 January 1888 \u2013 10 October 1958) was a violinist,\ncomposer, and teacher. He is best known today for his collections of method\nbooks for the violin.\n\n## Biography\n\nGaylord Purcell Yost was born on January 28, 1888 in Fayette, Ohio. He was the\nonly child of Charles E. Yost, the proprietor and a journalist of The Fayette\nReview (the only newspaper in the village at the time) and Ada Purcell,\ndaughter of Lott. A Purcell, a well-known figure in Fayette. He started\nplaying violin in elementary school, and by age 12, he began composing violin\nand piano duets. By age 15, he was the leading violin teacher in the area. In\n1903, he went to further his studies at the Toledo Conservatory. He remained\nthere through 1904, then in 1905 went to the Detroit Conservatory, where he\nremained until 1906. After leaving Detroit, he went to Berlin to study with\nrenowned Russian virtuoso . He moved to Indianapolis around 1907 and between\n1907 and 1911 he toured as a concert artist across the United States, Europe,\nand South America. He began teaching at the collegiate level in 1911, as head\nof the violin department of the Indiana Conservatory of Music. He started\nteaching at Indiana University as head of the violin department in 1915, and\nalso taught at the Indiana College of Music and Fine Arts around this time. In\n1919, he moved to Pittsburgh and shortly thereafter became head of the violin\ndepartment at Pittsburgh Musical Institute, a position he held for 25 years.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, he conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony and formed the Yost\nString Quartet. He served as the first violinist, with Roy Shoemaker, a former\nPittsburgh Symphony musician and string department chair at PMI, as second\nviolinist, Carl Rosenberg as violist, and James Younger as cellist. In 1909,\nhe married Ella Caroline Schroeder, another violinist from Detroit. Later, in\n1917, he remarried to Ruth Margaret Stuernagel, with whom he had two children:\nGaylord C Yost and Sandia Yost. In 1936, he earned the Doctorate of Music\ndegree from Waynesburg College as well as an honorary membership in the\nInstitut Litteraire et Artistique de France. In 1950, his father died. This\nprompted Yost to move back to Fayette in 1951 and take over his father's old\nnewspaper. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the mayor of Fayette. He died in\nFayette on October 10, 1958 at the age of 70.\n\n## Works\n\nYost authored numerous short compositions for violin and piano through his\ncareer. One of his pieces, \"Ecolouge\", won the Institut Litteraire et\nArtistique de France's first prize in 1939. The International Who's Who in\nMusic and Musical Gazetteer, published in 1918, has a short list of his\ncompositions, and also notes that they were performed by Albert Spalding,\nEfrem Zimbalist, Arthur Hartmann, Kathleen Parlow, Maud Powell, and Louis\nPersinger, among others. Yost may be more widely known for his Yost Violin\nSystem, a myriad of method books for the violin, which focus on building basic\ntechnique to solidify one's playing. Who's Who in America asserted he had made\n\"revolutionary discoveries\" with his publication of the Yost System. Some of\nhis books include:\n\n  * Studies in Pizzicato and Harmonics\n  * Exercises for Change of Position\n  * Scale and Arpeggio Studies\n  * Key to the Mastery of the Finger Board\n  * Key to the Mastery of Bowing\n  * Bow and Finger Magic\n  * Spivakovsky Way of Bowing\n  * Key to the Mastery of Double-Stopping\n  * Studies in Finger Action and Position Playing\n\nMany of his method books are considered indispensable in violin technique.\n\n## References\n\n## See also\n\n  * http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/tc/id/27540\n\n",
      "# List of banana cultivars\n\nThe following is a list of banana cultivars and the groups into which they are\nclassified. Almost all modern cultivated varieties (cultivars) of edible\nbananas and plantains are hybrids and polyploids of two wild, seeded banana\nspecies, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. Cultivated bananas are almost\nalways seedless (parthenocarpic) and hence sterile, so they are propagated\nvegetatively (cloned). They are classified into groups according to a genome-\nbased system introduced by Ernest Cheesman, Norman Simmonds, and Ken Shepherd,\nwhich indicates the degree of genetic inheritance from the two wild parents\nand the number of chromosomes (ploidy). Cultivars derived from Musa acuminata\nare more likely to be used as dessert bananas, while those derived from Musa\nbalbisiana and hybrids of the two are usually plantains or cooking bananas.\n\n## Classification of cultivars\n\nBanana plants were originally classified by Linnaeus into two species, which\nhe called Musa paradisiaca \u2013 those used as cooking bananas (plantains), and M.\nsapientum \u2013 those used as dessert bananas. The primary center of diversity of\ncultivated bananas is Southeast Asia. Botanical exploration of this area led\nto many more species being named, along with subspecies and varieties.\nHowever, this approach proved inadequate to deal with the large number of\ncultivated varieties (cultivars) which were discovered, and many of the names\nlater proved to be synonyms. Furthermore, it was discovered that most\ncultivated bananas are actually hybrids between two wild species, M. acuminata\nand M. balbisiana, both first described in 1820 by the Italian botanist Luigi\nAloysius Colla, and that Linnaeus' two \"species\" were both this hybrid, which\nis now called M. \u00d7 paradisiaca. Unlike the wild species, which have seeds,\ncultivated bananas are almost always seedless (parthenocarpic) and hence\nsterile, so they have to be propagated vegetatively. In 1955, researchers\nNorman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed abandoning traditional Latin-based\nbotanical names for cultivated bananas. This approach foreshadowed the\nInternational Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants which, in addition to\nusing Latin names based on the International Code of Nomenclature for algae,\nfungi, and plants, gives cultivars names in a currently spoken language,\nenclosed in single quotes, and organizes them into \"cultivar groups\", also not\ngiven Latin names. Banana cultivars derived from M. acuminata and M.\nbalbisiana can be classified into cultivar groups using two criteria. The\nfirst is the number of chromosomes: whether the plant is diploid, triploid or\ntetraploid. The second is relationship to the two ancestral species, which may\nbe determined by genetic analysis or by a scoring system devised by Simmonds\nand Shepherd. A cultivar is scored on 15 characters, chosen because they\ndiffer between the two species. Each character is given a score between one\nand five according to whether it is typical of M. acuminata or of M. babisiana\nor is in between. Thus the total score for a cultivar will range from 15 if\nall characters agree with M. acuminata to 75 if all characters agree with M.\nbalbisiana. Intermediate scores suggest mixed ancestry: for example, 45 would\nbe expected for diploids with equal genetic contributions from both species.\nGroups are then named using a combination of the letters \"A\" and \"B\". The\nnumber of letters shows the ploidy; the proportion of As and Bs the\ncontributions of the ancestral species. The AAB Group, for example, comprises\ntriploid cultivars with more genetic inheritance from M. acuminata than M.\nbalbisiana. A character score of around 35 is expected for members of this\ngroup. Within groups, cultivars may be divided into subgroups and then given a\ncultivar name, e.g. Musa AAA Group (Cavendish Subgroup) 'Robusta'. In\npractice, the scoring system and the associated grouping is not as\nstraightforward as the Simmonds and Shepherd naming system implies. For\nexample, a member of the AAB Group should have a score about one third of the\nway between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana (i.e. about 35) if one third of its\nchromosomes come from M. balbisiana. However, the cultivars 'Silk' and 'Pome',\nboth classified in the AAB Group, scored 26 and 46 respectively. The cultivar\n'Pelipita' is placed in the ABB group, so should have 11 of its 33 chromosomes\nderived from M. acuminata. However, a technique called \"genomic in situ\nhybridization\" (GISH) showed that actually only 8 chromosomes were of this\norigin. Other lines of evidence suggest a more complex genome structure is\npresent in other banana cultivars, so the group names should not be taken at\nface value.\n\n## Cultivars\n\nThe total number of cultivars of bananas and plantains has been estimated to\nbe anything from around 300 to more than 1000. Names are highly confused, even\nwithin a single country. Many common names do not refer to a single cultivar\nor clone; for example 'Lady's Finger' or 'Lady Finger' has been used as the\nname for members of different genome groups, including AA and AAB. Many other\nnames are synonyms of cultivars grown in the same or different countries.\nAttempts have been made to create lists of synonyms. In 2000, Valmayor et al.\nlisted equivalent local names for 68 cultivars across five Southeast Asian\ncountries (the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam),\ntogether with their internationally used names. They considered a further 81\ncultivars to be unique to one country. In 2007, Ploetz et al. listed more\ncultivar names and synonyms, with an emphasis on those grown in the islands of\nthe Pacific, but including some grown in areas such as India, Africa and South\nAmerica. As an example, for the widely grown cultivar 'Dwarf Cavendish', they\ngave 58 synonyms from 29 different countries or geographical areas. ProMusa\nhas created a checklist of banana cultivar names based on available\nliterature. A recent development is the use of \"somaclones\" in banana\ncultivation. Micropropagation involves growing plants from very small amounts\nof source tissue, sometimes even a single cell, under sterile conditions using\nartificial techniques to induce growth. The purpose of micropropagation is\noften to produce a large number of genetically identical offspring. However,\nby inducing mutations through various means, it is possible to produce plants\nwhich differ slightly from the \"parent\" plant and from each other (\"somaclonal\nvariations\"). By growing on these somaclones and selecting those with\ndesirable features, new cultivars can be produced which are very similar to an\nexisting cultivar, but differ in one or two features, such as disease\nresistance. Somaclones may only be distinguishable by genetic analysis.\n\n### Musa section\n\nMusa \u00d7 paradisiaca is the name for hybrids between Musa acuminata (A) and Musa\nbalbisiana (B), both in the Musa section:\n\n#### AA Group\n\nDiploid Musa acuminata, both wild banana plants and cultivars\n\n  * Chingan banana\n  * Lacatan banana\n  * Lady Finger banana (Sugar banana)\n  * Pisang jari buaya (Crocodile fingers banana)\n  * Se\u00f1orita banana (Monkoy, Arnibal banana, Cuarenta dias, Cari\u00f1osa, Pisang Empat Puluh Hari, Pisang Lampung)\n  * Sinwobogi banana\n\n#### AAA Group\n\nTriploid Musa acuminata, both wild banana plants and cultivars\n\n  * Cavendish Subgroup\n    * 'Dwarf Cavendish'\n    * 'Giant Cavendish' ('Williams')\n      * Formosana (GCTCV-218), a variant with some resistance to Fusarium wilt TR4\n    * 'Grand Nain' ('Chiquita')\n    * 'Masak Hijau'\n    * 'Robusta'\n  * 'Red Dacca'\n  * Dwarf Red banana\n  * Flhorban 920\n  * Gros Michel banana\n  * East African Highland bananas (AAA-EA subgroup)\n\n#### AAAA Group\n\nTetraploid Musa acuminata, both wild bananas and cultivars\n\n  * Bodles Altafort banana\n  * Golden Beauty banana\n\n#### AAAB Group\n\nTetraploid cultivars of Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca\n\n  * Atan banana\n  * Goldfinger banana\n\n#### AAB Group\n\nTriploid cultivars of Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca.

      "# Home Run Derby (TV series)\n\nHome Run Derby is a 1960 television show that was held at Wrigley Field in Los\nAngeles pitting the top sluggers of Major League Baseball against each other\nin nine-inning home run contests. The show was produced and hosted by\nactor/broadcaster Mark Scott and distributed by Ziv Television Programs.\nFilmed in December 1959, the series aired in syndication from January 9 to\nJuly 2, 1960, and helped inspire the Home Run Derby event that is now held the\nday before the annual Major League Baseball All-Star Game. ESPN staged a\nrevival of the show in 1989.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe rules were similar to modern home run derbies, with two notable\nexceptions. If a batter did not swing at a pitch that was in the strike zone,\nthat also constituted an out. Also, the contests were conducted in a fashion\nmore similar to a baseball game than the modern home run derbies, in which a\nplayer has a set number of outs before his turn is over. Batters were given\nthree outs per inning, and the player with the most home runs after nine\ninnings won. The defending champion had the advantage of batting last; his\nopponent batted first. Any ball not hit for a home run was an out. The player\ndid not have to swing at every pitch, but if a pitch was in the strike zone\nthat also constituted an out, as did a swing and a miss. These rarely happened\nas the pitcher was supposed to give the batters good balls to hit. If the\nplayers were tied after nine innings, the Derby went into extra innings as per\nregular baseball. When a left-handed hitter played, a special rule was put\ninto place. Wrigley Field in Los Angeles had an inner fence with palm trees\nand a brick wall located several feet behind it. Any pitch hit in that\ndirection had to clear the wall or hit the top of the trees that stuck out\nover the wall to count as a home run. This was done because the distance was\nshorter to right field with the inner fence, which would otherwise give a\nlefty an unfair advantage. The distances were still slightly different once\nthe deeper right field wall was factored in, but at 339 feet vs. 340 feet the\ndifference was negligible. While one player was taking his turn at bat, the\nother player would sit at the host's booth and have a brief conversation,\ntypically unrehearsed small talk about the contest itself or the player's\nperformance that season. Willie Mays, who was a champion later in the run\nafter losing in the initial contest to Mantle, joked with host Scott during\nhis run that the host should be quiet while he batted for his third\nconsecutive home run (for which Mays would receive a $500 bonus). Scott took\nhim up on it, speaking into the microphone sotto voce, similar to a bowling or\ngolf announcer, whenever Mays stepped up to the plate. Sometimes when the\nbatter hit a ball into the deep outfield, the player in the booth would\ncomment that it would have gone for extra bases in a real game, to which Scott\nreplied that \"on Home Run Derby it's nothing but an out\". Some players wore\ngolf gloves during the show - a notable addition because the batting glove was\nstill years away from being a normal part of a player's gear.\n\n## Participants\n\nNineteen players, including nine future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame,\nparticipated in the series \u2013 \"almost all the power hitters of the era.\" Four\nof the participants are still alive: Aaron, Colavito, Kaline and Mays. One\npitcher for the show was former major leaguer Tom Saffell and the catcher was\nminor leaguer John VanOrnum, later a San Francisco Giants' coach. Art\nPassarella, a former American League umpire who would go on to a TV acting\ncareer, served as the plate umpire. There were also umpires along both foul\nlines to help judge fly balls that were close calls.\n\n### Venue choice\n\nScott noted that Wrigley Field in Los Angeles was chosen to host the event\nbecause its fence distances were symmetrical, favoring neither right-handed\nnor left-handed hitters. Despite Scott's assertions, the left field wall was\nactually a few feet higher than the right field wall, which slightly penalized\nright-handed line-drive hitters such as Gus Triandos. The Los Angeles Dodgers\nplayed at the Memorial Coliseum during 1958\u20131961, a site that would have given\nan unfair advantage to right-handed batters.\n\n## Prizes\n\nThe winner received a check for $2,000 and was invited back for the next\nweek's episode against a new opponent (a rarity in that era for syndicated\ngames); the runner-up received a check for $1,000. If a batter hit three home\nruns in a row, he would receive a $500 bonus check. A fourth home run in a row\nwould be worth another $500 bonus check. Any consecutive home runs hit beyond\nthat would each be worth $1,000. Each show would end with the host presenting\neach player with their prize checks (beginning with the loser), and would\naward separate checks for consecutive home run bonuses. These were actual bank\nchecks, not the jumbo \"display\" checks typically used today. For example, if\nthe winner hit three homers in a row, they would receive one check for $2,000\nand another for $500 instead of one check for $2,500. As an incentive for\nthrowing good home-run-hitting balls, the pitcher who threw the most pitches\nfor home runs also received a bonus, according to the host. Unlike more recent\nhome run derbies, which usually award prizes in the form of donations to a\nplayer's choice of charity, the economic realities of the era meant that the\ncash prizes earned by the players on the show were a substantial income\nsupplement.\n\n### Records\n\nThe most home runs in a derby was 25, in the Jackie Jensen vs. Ernie Banks\ncontest (14\u201311), while the fewest was 4, in the Hank Aaron vs. Duke Snider\ncontest (3\u20131). Jensen's 14 home runs against Banks were the most a player hit\nin a single contest. Only one home run was recorded in a contest three times;\nby Snider, Al Kaline, and Gus Triandos. Mickey Mantle hit the most home runs\non the show, a total of 44 during his five appearances. Aaron won the most\nmoney during the show's run, $13,500. Snider, Kaline, and Triandos each won\nthe minimum of $1000. Aaron had the best overall record at 6\u20131, while Rocky\nColavito and Jim Lemon were each 0\u20132. Jensen was the only player to hit four\nand subsequently five home runs in a row, doing so in the fourth inning of the\nfinal episode.

Triandos was the only\ncatcher to participate on the program; despite never hitting more than 30 home\nruns in a season and ending his career with 167 home runs, he was chosen\nbecause he was the best power-hitting catcher in the major leagues at the\ntime. He also took until the seventh inning to hit his first home run, the\nlongest such drought in a contest, and just surpassing Snider, who hit a home\nrun off the trees in the sixth inning of his contest vs. Aaron.

      "# 2017 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby\n\nThe 2017 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby was a home run hitting contest\nbetween eight batters from Major League Baseball (MLB). The derby was held on\nJuly 10, 2017, at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida, the site of the 2017 MLB\nAll-Star Game. On July 5, the participants were announced. Aaron Judge won,\nbecoming the first rookie to win the event outright.\n\n## Rules\n\nEight players participated in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination\ntimed event. Each player had four minutes to hit as many home runs as\npossible. Hitters were awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home\nruns over . Hitters were also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock\n(two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute\nresulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile & MLB, to the Boys &\nGirls Clubs of America. The eight competing players were seeded 1-8 based on\ntheir home run totals. The higher seed hit second in any round, and the round\nended if the higher seed surpassed the total of the first hitter. In the event\nof a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off\n(with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player got three\nswings; whoever hit more home runs in the three swings would be declared the\nwinner; thereafter, sudden death swings would occur until the tie was broken.\n\n## Results\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\n\nIn baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter\nis able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any\nrunners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An\nautomatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the\noutfield fence in fair territory. More rarely, an inside-the-park home run\noccurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play\non the field. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the\nhome run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year. Only home\nruns hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead.\nMark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other\nplayer that year. However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL)\nOakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway\nthrough the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24,\nrespectively) did not qualify to lead either league. The first home run\nchampion in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural\n1876 season, Hall hit five home runs for the short-lived National League\nPhiladelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall\nof Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 home runs for the American\nLeague Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 22-season career, Babe\nRuth led the American League in home runs 12 times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph\nKiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt\nwith eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven\nconsecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run\ntitles by any player. Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season home\nrun record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and\nfinally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are tied for the widest margin\nof victory for a home run champion as he topped the next highest total by 35\nhome runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years\nuntil Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years\nlater by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record\nchase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also\nhas the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in\n2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs \u2013\nGreg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez,\nLuis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs\n42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major\nleague was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in\n1878.\n\n## Key\n\n## American League\n\n## National League\n\n## Other major leagues\n\n## See also\n\n  * Babe Ruth Home Run Award (discontinued) \u2013 awarded to the MLB home-run leader\n  * Josh Gibson Legacy Award \u2013 awarded to the AL and NL home-run leaders\n  * Mel Ott Award \u2013 awarded to the NL home-run leader\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * Recognized \"major leagues\" include the current American and National Leagues and several defunct leagues \u2013 the American Association, the Federal League, the Players' League, and the Union Association.\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# Run batted in\n\nA run batted in (RBI), plural runs batted in (RBI or RBIs), is a statistic in\nbaseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a\nrun to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made\non the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit, then another player\non a higher base can head home to score a run, and the batter gets credited\nwith batting in that run. Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs\nbatted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI\nstatistic was tabulated\u2014unofficially\u2014from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer\nErnie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. Common\nnicknames for an RBI include \"ribby\" (or \"ribbie\"), \"rib\", and \"ribeye\". The\nplural of RBI is generally \"RBIs\", although some commentators use \"RBI\" as\nboth singular and plural, as it can also stand for \"runs batted in\".\n\n## Major League Baseball Rules\n\nThe 2018 edition of the Official Baseball Rules of Major League Baseball\n(MLB), Rule 9.04 Runs Batted In, reads: From 1980 to 1988, the game-winning\nRBI was an additional statistic used in MLB.\n\n## Criticism\n\nThe perceived significance of the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one\nof the three categories that compose the triple crown. In addition, career\nRBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of\nFame. However, critics, particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue\nthat RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player\nhimself. This is because an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or\nmore batters preceding him in the batting order have reached base (the\nexception to this being a home run, in which the batter is credited with\ndriving himself in, not just those already on base). This implies that better\noffensive teams \u2014and therefore, the teams in which the most players get on\nbase\u2014 tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals than equivalent hitters\non lesser-hitting teams.\n\n## RBI leaders in Major League Baseball\n\n### Career\n\nTotals are current through July 29, 2019.

      "# List of New York Yankees team records\n\nThe New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx, New\nYork. They compete in the East Division of Major League Baseball's (MLB)\nAmerican League (AL). The club began play in 1903 as the Highlanders, after\nowners Frank Farrell and William S. Devery had bought the defunct Baltimore\nOrioles and moved the team to New York City; in 1913, the team changed its\nnickname to the Yankees. From 1903 to 2019, the franchise has won more than\n10,000 games and 27 World Series championships. The list below documents\nplayers and teams that hold particular club records. Outfielder Babe Ruth\nholds the most franchise records, with 16, including career home runs, and\ncareer and single-season batting average and on-base percentage. Shortstop\nDerek Jeter has the second-most records among hitters, with eight. Jeter's\nmarks include the records for career hits, singles, doubles, and stolen bases.\nAmong pitchers, Whitey Ford has the most Yankees records with five, all of\nwhich are career totals. These include games won, games started, and innings\npitched. Several Yankees hold AL and MLB records. Ruth has MLB single-season\nrecords for extra-base hits and total bases, and holds four other AL single-\nseason records. Outfielder Joe DiMaggio had a 56-game hitting streak in the\n1941 season, which remains an MLB record.

      "# Home Run Derby (TV series)\n\nHome Run Derby is a 1960 television show that was held at Wrigley Field in Los\nAngeles pitting the top sluggers of Major League Baseball against each other\nin nine-inning home run contests. The show was produced and hosted by\nactor/broadcaster Mark Scott and distributed by Ziv Television Programs.\nFilmed in December 1959, the series aired in syndication from January 9 to\nJuly 2, 1960, and helped inspire the Home Run Derby event that is now held the\nday before the annual Major League Baseball All-Star Game. ESPN staged a\nrevival of the show in 1989.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe rules were similar to modern home run derbies, with two notable\nexceptions. If a batter did not swing at a pitch that was in the strike zone,\nthat also constituted an out. Also, the contests were conducted in a fashion\nmore similar to a baseball game than the modern home run derbies, in which a\nplayer has a set number of outs before his turn is over. Batters were given\nthree outs per inning, and the player with the most home runs after nine\ninnings won. The defending champion had the advantage of batting last; his\nopponent batted first. Any ball not hit for a home run was an out. The player\ndid not have to swing at every pitch, but if a pitch was in the strike zone\nthat also constituted an out, as did a swing and a miss. These rarely happened\nas the pitcher was supposed to give the batters good balls to hit. If the\nplayers were tied after nine innings, the Derby went into extra innings as per\nregular baseball. When a left-handed hitter played, a special rule was put\ninto place. Wrigley Field in Los Angeles had an inner fence with palm trees\nand a brick wall located several feet behind it. Any pitch hit in that\ndirection had to clear the wall or hit the top of the trees that stuck out\nover the wall to count as a home run. This was done because the distance was\nshorter to right field with the inner fence, which would otherwise give a\nlefty an unfair advantage. The distances were still slightly different once\nthe deeper right field wall was factored in, but at 339 feet vs. 340 feet the\ndifference was negligible. While one player was taking his turn at bat, the\nother player would sit at the host's booth and have a brief conversation,\ntypically unrehearsed small talk about the contest itself or the player's\nperformance that season. Willie Mays, who was a champion later in the run\nafter losing in the initial contest to Mantle, joked with host Scott during\nhis run that the host should be quiet while he batted for his third\nconsecutive home run (for which Mays would receive a $500 bonus). Scott took\nhim up on it, speaking into the microphone sotto voce, similar to a bowling or\ngolf announcer, whenever Mays stepped up to the plate. Sometimes when the\nbatter hit a ball into the deep outfield, the player in the booth would\ncomment that it would have gone for extra bases in a real game, to which Scott\nreplied that \"on Home Run Derby it's nothing but an out\". Some players wore\ngolf gloves during the show - a notable addition because the batting glove was\nstill years away from being a normal part of a player's gear.\n\n## Participants\n\nNineteen players, including nine future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame,\nparticipated in the series \u2013 \"almost all the power hitters of the era.\" Four\nof the participants are still alive: Aaron, Colavito, Kaline and Mays. One\npitcher for the show was former major leaguer Tom Saffell and the catcher was\nminor leaguer John VanOrnum, later a San Francisco Giants' coach. Art\nPassarella, a former American League umpire who would go on to a TV acting\ncareer, served as the plate umpire. There were also umpires along both foul\nlines to help judge fly balls that were close calls.\n\n### Venue choice\n\nScott noted that Wrigley Field in Los Angeles was chosen to host the event\nbecause its fence distances were symmetrical, favoring neither right-handed\nnor left-handed hitters. Despite Scott's assertions, the left field wall was\nactually a few feet higher than the right field wall, which slightly penalized\nright-handed line-drive hitters such as Gus Triandos. The Los Angeles Dodgers\nplayed at the Memorial Coliseum during 1958\u20131961, a site that would have given\nan unfair advantage to right-handed batters.\n\n## Prizes\n\nThe winner received a check for $2,000 and was invited back for the next\nweek's episode against a new opponent (a rarity in that era for syndicated\ngames); the runner-up received a check for $1,000. If a batter hit three home\nruns in a row, he would receive a $500 bonus check. A fourth home run in a row\nwould be worth another $500 bonus check. Any consecutive home runs hit beyond\nthat would each be worth $1,000. Each show would end with the host presenting\neach player with their prize checks (beginning with the loser), and would\naward separate checks for consecutive home run bonuses. These were actual bank\nchecks, not the jumbo \"display\" checks typically used today. For example, if\nthe winner hit three homers in a row, they would receive one check for $2,000\nand another for $500 instead of one check for $2,500. As an incentive for\nthrowing good home-run-hitting balls, the pitcher who threw the most pitches\nfor home runs also received a bonus, according to the host. Unlike more recent\nhome run derbies, which usually award prizes in the form of donations to a\nplayer's choice of charity, the economic realities of the era meant that the\ncash prizes earned by the players on the show were a substantial income\nsupplement.\n\n### Records\n\nThe most home runs in a derby was 25, in the Jackie Jensen vs. Ernie Banks\ncontest (14\u201311), while the fewest was 4, in the Hank Aaron vs. Duke Snider\ncontest (3\u20131). Jensen's 14 home runs against Banks were the most a player hit\nin a single contest. Only one home run was recorded in a contest three times;\nby Snider, Al Kaline, and Gus Triandos. Mickey Mantle hit the most home runs\non the show, a total of 44 during his five appearances. Aaron won the most\nmoney during the show's run, $13,500. Snider, Kaline, and Triandos each won\nthe minimum of $1000. Aaron had the best overall record at 6\u20131, while Rocky\nColavito and Jim Lemon were each 0\u20132. Jensen was the only player to hit four\nand subsequently five home runs in a row, doing so in the fourth inning of the\nfinal episode. Snider and Eddie Mathews were the only left-handed batters to\ncompete. Switch-hitter Mantle batted right-handed in the contests; he hit 372\nhomers left-handed in his career and only 164 right-handed, but he chose to\nbat exclusively right-handed for this series, commenting in the first episode\nthat his longest home runs had come right-handed. Triandos was the only\ncatcher to participate on the program; despite never hitting more than 30 home\nruns in a season and ending his career with 167 home runs, he was chosen\nbecause he was the best power-hitting catcher in the major leagues at the\ntime. He also took until the seventh inning to hit his first home run, the\nlongest such drought in a contest, and just surpassing Snider, who hit a home\nrun off the trees in the sixth inning of his contest vs. Aaron. Triandos was\nnonetheless good-natured, treating his futility with a mix of self-deprecation\nand humorous sarcasm, and wishing Dick Stuart luck after their competition.\n\n## Demise\n\nScott's play-by-play and interviewing style was not very different from many\nof the announcers of that era (straightforward and upbeat). Scott died on July\n13, 1960, from a heart attack at the age of 45; in the wake of his death, the\nproducers decided not to replace him and instead canceled the show. (Benjamin\nStoloff, the series director, died September 8 of the same year.)\n\n## ESPN revival\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, the Major League Baseball Players Association held similar\ncontests at Cashman Field in Las Vegas, Nevada. The contests were held just\nbefore spring training, consisted of eight-man elimination tournaments, and\nwere televised on ESPN. The contests lasted for only five innings.\n\n## Episode status\n\nThe original series is intact, having been rerun on ESPN from December 17 to\n28, 1988, and July 10 to October 28, 1989. Its rights now belong to MGM\nTelevision. The series proved popular and was credited in part with the\nestablishment of a classic sports network which would eventually become ESPN\nClassic. ESPN Classic ran the program in primetime in September and November\n2009 after a 2-year hiatus, and still occasionally carries episodes in\nmiddays. In later years the intro, as well as some comments at the close of\nthe show, were narrated by former Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Ross Porter.\nIn the summer of 2007, MGM Home Entertainment (with distribution by 20th\nCentury Fox Home Entertainment, which is owned by the same company that owns\nthe current over-the-air home of the MLB, the Fox Broadcasting Company) began\nto release the 1960 series on three DVDs.

Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"So give this reasonably\nabsorbing series a little credit, even though it often seems to be merely\nreworking various fantasy formulas. It moves quickly and does a nice job of\nweaving together two story lines involving an elfin world that is threatened\nwhen a giant tree, known as the Ellcrys, begins to die.\" Maureen Ryan of\nVariety wrote: \"Sure, Shannara, which harks back to the golden age of\nsyndicated genre fare, is a standard quest journey in which there are trolls,\ngnomes, living trees and magic books, and characters say things like, 'If\nAllanon is here, there are dark days ahead.' But there's conviction in the\nshow's execution.\"\n\n### Ratings\n\n#### Season 1 (2016)\n\n#### Season 2 (2017)\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe series was nominated for a Saturn Award for \"Best Fantasy TV Series\" for\nthe 2015\u20132016 season.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Supernatural (season 4)\n\nThe fourth season of Supernatural, an American dark fantasy television series\ncreated by Eric Kripke, premiered September 18, 2008, and concluded on May 14,\n2009, on The CW. This season focuses on brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and\nDean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) encountering angels for the first time in\ntheir lives as hunters of the supernatural; this marks the introduction of\neventual series regular, the angel Castiel (Misha Collins). The angels\nintervene to rescue Dean from Hell and bring him back to life after he was\ntrapped there in the third season finale \"No Rest for the Wicked\". They\nexplain that they have arrived on Earth for the first time in thousands of\nyears in order to prevent demons from freeing the fallen angel Lucifer from\nHell, as Lucifer would then cause the Apocalypse. The demons are led by the\nWinchesters' enemy, and Dean's murderer, Lilith. However, it becomes\nincreasingly clear that something is wrong with Heaven and that the angels\nhave their own agendas. Despite an initially happy reunion, tension grows\nbetween Sam and Dean because Dean fears Sam's growing demonic powers and\ndistrusts Sam's returning demonic ally Ruby (Genevieve Cortese).\n\n## Cast\n\n### Starring\n\n  * Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester\n  * Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester\n\n### Guest stars\n\n## Episodes\n\nIn this table, the number in the first column refers to the episode's number\nwithin the entire series, whereas the number in the second column indicates\nthe episode's number within that particular season. \"U.S. viewers in millions\"\nrefers to how many Americans watched the episode live or on the day of\nbroadcast.\n\n## Production\n\nThe mythology was expanded even more in the fourth season with the\nintroduction of angels. While Kripke originally did not want angels to be\nfeatured in the series, he changed his mind when he realized that he needed\nthem in order to have a \"cosmic battle\" with the many demons. With this\nconcept added into the series' mythology, the writers came to view the show as\nbeing \"about two greasers and a muscle car, but the canvas that they're on are\ndemons and angels and battles and the apocalypse...\" While it was originally\nintended for the fourth season to feature an \"all-out demon war\", budget cuts\nforced the writers to change their plans, making it \"smaller, more contained,\nunderground, more guerrilla-style\". Kripke feels this ended up benefiting the\nseries, believing the brothers-centric episodes to be more interesting than\nthe \"epic\" ones of the third season. Thus, the war was depicted in the\nwriters' \"scruffy, angsty, Supernatural way\" while focusing more on the\ncharacters. The writing staff felt that the fourth season's mythology had been\nthe best since the first season.\n\n## Reception\n\nSeason 4 received highly positive reviews and is the best reviewed season of\nthe series. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100%\napproval rating for Supernatural's fourth season, with an average rating of\n9.65/10 based on 5 reviews.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",

The series was later considered officially concluded.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Shannara Chronicles has received mixed reviews, receiving a 52/100 score\non Metacritic, based on 15 reviews and a 54% for season 1 on Rotten Tomatoes\nbased on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical\nconsensus reads: \"The Shannara Chronicles wears its influences heavily on its\nsleeve and needs to find surer footing before it can tap its true potential,\nbut it still might suffice for viewers in search of a teen-friendly Game of\nThrones.\" The second season received a 100% approval rating based on five\nreviews. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"So give this reasonably\nabsorbing series a little credit, even though it often seems to be merely\nreworking various fantasy formulas. It moves quickly and does a nice job of\nweaving together two story lines involving an elfin world that is threatened\nwhen a giant tree, known as the Ellcrys, begins to die.\" Maureen Ryan of\nVariety wrote: \"Sure, Shannara, which harks back to the golden age of\nsyndicated genre fare, is a standard quest journey in which there are trolls,\ngnomes, living trees and magic books, and characters say things like, 'If\nAllanon is here, there are dark days ahead.' But there's conviction in the\nshow's execution.\"\n\n### Ratings\n\n#### Season 1 (2016)\n\n#### Season 2 (2017)\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe series was nominated for a Saturn Award for \"Best Fantasy TV Series\" for\nthe 2015\u20132016 season.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

    "question": "When was the new international version bible's first major revision released?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is\nas well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in\nBible classes and children's ministries.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Committee on Bible Translation (CBT)\n  * Biblica\n  * Michael Marlowe on the NIV\n  * Read the New International Version (NIV) Bible \n  * \"Is Your Modern Translation Corrupt?\", Dr. James R.

    "gold_doc": [
      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",

Written by Winehouse and Salaam\nRemi, \"Stronger Than Me\" was released in the United Kingdom as the lead single\non 6 October 2003, it ended up as the lowest-charting single from Frank and of\nWinehouse's career, peaking at number 71 on the UK Singles Chart. The song\nnevertheless won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song Musically\nand Lyrically in 2004. The single for \"Stronger Than Me\" features an exclusive\nB-side, \"What It Is\". A rare live version of the song performed by Winehouse\nwas featured in the documentary film biopic that's based on the life & death\nof Winehouse, Amy (2015) and the original version was included on the film's\noriginal soundtrack. It was said in the film that \"Stronger Than Me\" first\nsold over 800 copies a day after its initial release by Winehouse's previous\nguitarist, Ian Burter.\n\n## Music video\n\nA music video was produced to promote the single. The video features Winehouse\nentering a bar and finding her boyfriend drunk. Winehouse laments her\nboyfriend's failure to be the stronger and more dominant partner. The video\ncontinues as she returns her boyfriend to their apartment. Winehouse is seen\nbeing fondled by her drunken boyfriend as they struggle to exit the bar, and\nshe looks on in disgust as he vomits in their taxi. As the video concludes,\nshe's seen on a street struggling to get her unconscious boyfriend into their\nhome. Failing to do so, Winehouse gives up, leaving him semi-conscious on the\nsidewalk and going inside as the song ends.\n\n## Track listings and formats\n\nUK CD single and digital download\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" \u2013 3:33\n* \"What It Is\" \u2013 4:44\n* \"Take the Box\" (The Headquarters Mix) \u2013 3:49\n\nUK promo CD single\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:33\n\nUK 12\" single\n\n* Side A:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Curtis Lynch Jnr.)\n* Side B:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Harmonic 33 Remix)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Acapella)\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# List of U.S. states and territories by elevation\n\nThe elevation of the U.S. states, the federal district, and the territories\nmay be described in several ways. These include: The following list is a\ncomparison of elevation absolutes in the United States. Data include interval\nmeasures of highest and lowest elevation for all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and territories. Which state or territory is \"highest\" and \"lowest\"\nis determined by the definition of \"high\" and \"low\". For instance, Alaska\ncould be regarded as the highest state because Denali, at , is the highest\npoint in the United States. However, Colorado, with the highest mean elevation\nof any state as well as the highest low point, could also be considered a\ncandidate for \"highest state\". Determining which state is \"lowest\" is equally\nproblematic. California contains the Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at below\nsea level, the lowest point in the United States; while Florida has the lowest\nhigh point, and Delaware has the lowest mean elevation. Florida is also the\nflattest state, with the smallest difference between its highest and lowest\npoints. The list of highest points in each state is important to the sport of\nhighpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point in each of\nthe contiguous 48 states, or in all 50 states, or in all 50 states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia and the territories.

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off.

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390).

The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section.

      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",
      "# Stronger Than Me\n\n\"Stronger Than Me\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse\nfrom her debut studio album Frank (2003). Written by Winehouse and Salaam\nRemi, \"Stronger Than Me\" was released in the United Kingdom as the lead single\non 6 October 2003, it ended up as the lowest-charting single from Frank and of\nWinehouse's career, peaking at number 71 on the UK Singles Chart. The song\nnevertheless won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song Musically\nand Lyrically in 2004. The single for \"Stronger Than Me\" features an exclusive\nB-side, \"What It Is\". A rare live version of the song performed by Winehouse\nwas featured in the documentary film biopic that's based on the life & death\nof Winehouse, Amy (2015) and the original version was included on the film's\noriginal soundtrack. It was said in the film that \"Stronger Than Me\" first\nsold over 800 copies a day after its initial release by Winehouse's previous\nguitarist, Ian Burter.\n\n## Music video\n\nA music video was produced to promote the single. The video features Winehouse\nentering a bar and finding her boyfriend drunk. Winehouse laments her\nboyfriend's failure to be the stronger and more dominant partner. The video\ncontinues as she returns her boyfriend to their apartment. Winehouse is seen\nbeing fondled by her drunken boyfriend as they struggle to exit the bar, and\nshe looks on in disgust as he vomits in their taxi. As the video concludes,\nshe's seen on a street struggling to get her unconscious boyfriend into their\nhome. Failing to do so, Winehouse gives up, leaving him semi-conscious on the\nsidewalk and going inside as the song ends.\n\n## Track listings and formats\n\nUK CD single and digital download\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" \u2013 3:33\n* \"What It Is\" \u2013 4:44\n* \"Take the Box\" (The Headquarters Mix) \u2013 3:49\n\nUK promo CD single\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:33\n\nUK 12\" single\n\n* Side A:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Curtis Lynch Jnr.)\n* Side B:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Harmonic 33 Remix)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Acapella)\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",

However, Colorado, with the highest mean elevation\nof any state as well as the highest low point, could also be considered a\ncandidate for \"highest state\". Determining which state is \"lowest\" is equally\nproblematic. California contains the Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at below\nsea level, the lowest point in the United States; while Florida has the lowest\nhigh point, and Delaware has the lowest mean elevation. Florida is also the\nflattest state, with the smallest difference between its highest and lowest\npoints. The list of highest points in each state is important to the sport of\nhighpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point in each of\nthe contiguous 48 states, or in all 50 states, or in all 50 states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia and the territories. As of 2006, 155 people had reached\nthe fifty state highpoints. Roughly 200\u2013300 people attend the Highpointers\nClub convention each year. All elevations in the table below have been\nadjusted to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",

The song\nnevertheless won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song Musically\nand Lyrically in 2004. The single for \"Stronger Than Me\" features an exclusive\nB-side, \"What It Is\". A rare live version of the song performed by Winehouse\nwas featured in the documentary film biopic that's based on the life & death\nof Winehouse, Amy (2015) and the original version was included on the film's\noriginal soundtrack. It was said in the film that \"Stronger Than Me\" first\nsold over 800 copies a day after its initial release by Winehouse's previous\nguitarist, Ian Burter.\n\n## Music video\n\nA music video was produced to promote the single. The video features Winehouse\nentering a bar and finding her boyfriend drunk. Winehouse laments her\nboyfriend's failure to be the stronger and more dominant partner. The video\ncontinues as she returns her boyfriend to their apartment. Winehouse is seen\nbeing fondled by her drunken boyfriend as they struggle to exit the bar, and\nshe looks on in disgust as he vomits in their taxi. As the video concludes,\nshe's seen on a street struggling to get her unconscious boyfriend into their\nhome.

      "# List of U.S. states and territories by elevation\n\nThe elevation of the U.S. states, the federal district, and the territories\nmay be described in several ways. These include: The following list is a\ncomparison of elevation absolutes in the United States. Data include interval\nmeasures of highest and lowest elevation for all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and territories. Which state or territory is \"highest\" and \"lowest\"\nis determined by the definition of \"high\" and \"low\". For instance, Alaska\ncould be regarded as the highest state because Denali, at , is the highest\npoint in the United States. However, Colorado, with the highest mean elevation\nof any state as well as the highest low point, could also be considered a\ncandidate for \"highest state\". Determining which state is \"lowest\" is equally\nproblematic. California contains the Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at below\nsea level, the lowest point in the United States; while Florida has the lowest\nhigh point, and Delaware has the lowest mean elevation. Florida is also the\nflattest state, with the smallest difference between its highest and lowest\npoints. The list of highest points in each state is important to the sport of\nhighpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point in each of\nthe contiguous 48 states, or in all 50 states, or in all 50 states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia and the territories.

      "# 60th parallel north\n\nThe 60th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 60 degrees north of\nEarth's equator. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America,\nand the Atlantic Ocean. Although it lies approximately twice as far away from\nthe Equator as from the North Pole, the 60th parallel is half as long as the\nEquator line. This is where the Earth bulges halfway as much as on the\nEquator. At this latitude, the Sun is visible for 18 hours, 52 minutes during\nthe June solstice and 5 hours, 52 minutes during the December solstice. The\nmaximum altitude of the Sun is 53.44\u00b0 on 21 June and 6.56\u00b0 on 21 December. The\nmaximum altitude of the Sun is > 15.00\u00ba in October and > 8.00\u00ba in November.\nThe lowest latitude where white nights can be observed is approximately on\nthis parallel.\n\n## Around the world\n\nStarting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 60\u00b0 north\npasses through:\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, the 60th parallel constitutes the mainland boundary between the\nnorthern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut to the\nnorth, and the western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,\nand Manitoba to the south. Accordingly, \"north of 60\" is an expression often\nused for the territories, although parts of Nunavut (the islands in Hudson Bay\nand James Bay) are located south of the 60th parallel, and parts of Quebec and\nNewfoundland and Labrador are located north, to the east of Hudson Bay. A\n1990s TV show on CBC about life in the Northwest Territories was called North\nof 60. Canada's only four corners are located at the intersection of the 60th\nparallel and the 102nd meridian west, between the Northwest Territories,\nNunavut, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. However, this is not a true quadripoint\nas the measurement of the Saskatchewan/Manitoba border in the 1880s placed it\napproximately west of the 102nd meridian, which defines part of the Northwest\nTerritories/Nunavut border.\n\n## Greenland\n\nBetween 1776 (leap year starting on Monday) and 1950 (common year starting on\nSunday), the 60th parallel formed the southern limit of the Royal Greenland\nTrade Department's exclusive monopoly on trade near the Dano-Norwegian and\nlater Danish colonies of Greenland (1776-1782) and South Greenland\n(1782-1950).\n\n## See also\n\n  * 58th parallel north\n  * 59th parallel north\n  * 61st parallel north\n  * 60th parallel south\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Alan Parsons\n\nAlan Parsons (born 20 December 1948) is an English audio engineer, songwriter,\nmusician, and record producer. He was involved with the production of several\nsignificant albums, including the Beatles' Abbey Road and Let It Be, and the\neponymous debut album by Ambrosia, as well as Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of\nthe Moon. Parsons' own group, The Alan Parsons Project, as well as his\nsubsequent solo recordings, have also been commercially successful. He has\nbeen nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, with his first win occurring in 2019 for\nBest Immersive Audio Album, Eye in the Sky (35th Anniversary Edition).\n\n## Career\n\nIn October 1967, at the age of 18, Parsons went to work as an assistant\nengineer at Abbey Road Studios, where he earned his first credit on the LP\nAbbey Road. He became a regular there, engineering such projects as Wings'\nWild Life and Red Rose Speedway, five albums by the Hollies, and Pink Floyd's\nThe Dark Side of the Moon, for which he received his first Grammy Award\nnomination. He was known for doing more than what would normally be considered\nthe scope of a recording engineer's duties. Parsons considered himself to be a\nrecording director, likening his contribution to recordings to what Stanley\nKubrick contributed to film. This is apparent in his work with Al Stewart's\n\"Year of the Cat\", where Parsons added the saxophone part and transformed the\noriginal folk concept into the jazz-influenced ballad that put Stewart onto\nthe charts. It is also heard in Parsons' influence on the Hollies' \"He Ain't\nHeavy, He's My Brother\" and \"The Air That I Breathe\". Parsons also produced\nthree albums by Pilot, a Scottish pop rock band consisting of Ian Bairnson on\nguitar, Stuart Tosh on drums, and David Paton on lead vocals, guitars, bass\nand William (Billy) Lyall, on piano and keys. Their hits included \"January\"\nand \"Magic\". He also mixed the debut album by the American band Ambrosia and\nproduced their second album Somewhere I've Never Travelled. Parsons was\nnominated for a Grammy Award for both albums. In 1975, he declined Pink\nFloyd's invitation to work on the follow-up for Dark Side, Wish You Were Here,\nand instead initiated the Alan Parsons Project with producer, songwriter, and\noccasional singer Eric Woolfson, whom he had met at Abbey Road. The Project\nconsisted of a revolving group of studio musicians and vocalists, most notably\nthe members of Pilot and (on the first album) the members of Ambrosia. Unlike\nmost rock groups, the Alan Parsons Project never performed live during its\nheyday, although it did release several music videos. Its only live\nperformance during its original incarnation was in 1990. It released ten\nalbums, the last in 1987. The Project terminated in 1990 after Parsons and\nWoolfson split, with the Project's intended 11th album released that year as a\nWoolfson solo album. Parsons continued to release work in his own name and in\ncollaboration with other musicians. Parsons and his band regularly toured many\nparts of the world. Although an accomplished vocalist, keyboardist, bassist,\nguitarist and flautist, Parsons only sang infrequent and incidental parts on\nhis albums, such as the background vocals on \"Time\". While his keyboard\nplaying was very audible on the Alan Parsons Project albums, very few\nrecordings feature his flute. He briefly returned to run Abbey Road Studios in\nits entirety. Parsons also continued with his selective production work for\nother bands. Of all his collaborators, guitarist Ian Bairnson worked with\nParsons the longest, including Parsons' post-Project albums, Try Anything\nOnce, On Air, and The Time Machine. In 1998, Parsons became Vice-President of\nEMI Studios Group, including the Abbey Road Studios. He soon left the post,\ndeciding to return to more creative endeavours. Parsons remained as a creative\nconsultant and associate producer for the group. As well as receiving gold and\nplatinum awards from many nations, Parsons has received ten Grammy Award\nnominations for engineering and production. In 2007 he received a nomination\nfor Best Surround Sound Album for A Valid Path. Beginning in 2001 and\nextending for four years, Parsons conceived and led a Beatles tribute show\ncalled A Walk Down Abbey Road featuring a group of headlining performers such\nas Todd Rundgren, Ann Wilson of Heart, John Entwistle of the Who, and Jack\nBruce of Cream. The show structure included a first set where all musicians\nassembled to perform each other's hits, and a second set featuring all Beatles\nsongs. Since 1999 he has toured under a revised name, the Alan Parsons Live\nProject (with Woolfson's permission). The band currently features lead singer\nP. J. Olsson, guitarist Jeff Kollman, drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist Tom\nBrooks, bass guitarist Guy Erez, vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper,\nguitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey, along with Parsons on rhythm guitar,\nkeyboards and vocals. This band performed live in Medell\u00edn, Colombia in 2013\nas Alan Parsons Symphonic Project in a performance recorded for Colombian\ntelevision and also released on CD (live 2-CD) and DVD (May 2016). In May\n2005, Parsons appeared at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, California, to mix\nfront-of-house sound for Southern California-based Pink Floyd tribute band\nWhich One's Pink? and their performance of The Dark Side of the Moon in its\nentirety. In 2010, Parsons released his single \"All Our Yesterdays\" through\nAuthentik Artists. Parsons also launched a DVD educational series in 2010\ntitled The Art and Science of Sound Recording (ASSR) on music production and\nthe complete audio recording process. The single \"All Our Yesterdays\" was\nwritten and recorded during the making of ASSR. The series, narrated by Billy\nBob Thornton, gives detailed tutorials on virtually every aspect of the sound\nrecording process. During 2010, several media reports, one of which included a\nquote from a representative of Parsons, alleged that the song \"Need You Now\"\nby country music group Lady Antebellum used the melody and arrangement of \"Eye\nin the Sky\". Parsons produced Jake Shimabukuro's album, Grand Ukulele, which\nwas released on 2 October 2012. Also in 2012, he contributed lead vocals and\nperformed keyboards and guitar on the track \"Precious Life\" by German\nelectronic music duo Lichtmond, and appeared with many other noted\nprogressive-rock musicians on The Prog Collective album by Billy Sherwood,\nsinging lead on \"The Technical Divide.\" Parsons engineered the third solo\nalbum by Steven Wilson, The Raven that Refused to Sing (And Other Stories),\nreleased on 25 February 2013. In late 2013, a live album recorded on tour in\nGermany and Austria with the title LiveSpan was released, accompanied by a\nsingle called \"Fragile\" with Simon Philips on drums. Legacy Recordings, the\ncatalogue division of Sony Music Entertainment, celebrated the 35th\nanniversary of Eye in the Sky, with the worldwide release of a definitive\ndeluxe collector's box set, featuring rare and unreleased material, on 17\nNovember 2017. In August 2018, Parsons announced that he will be releasing a\nstudio album in 2019. \u201cThe Secret\u201d was his first album in 15 years.\n\n## Personal life\n\nParsons was born in London. He resides in Santa Barbara, California, with his\nwife Lisa and her two daughters, Tabitha and Brittni, as well as numerous\npets. He has two sons, Jeremy (Jerry) and Daniel, from his previous marriage.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Full discography\n\n### Billboard Top 40 hit singles (US)\n\n  * 1976: \"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" \u2013 No. 37\n  * 1977: \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" \u2013 No. 36\n  * 1979: \"Damned If I Do\" \u2013 No. 27\n  * 1980: \"Games People Play\" \u2013 No. 16\n  * 1981: \"Time\" \u2013 No. 15\n  * 1982: \"Eye in the Sky\" \u2013 No. 3\n  * 1984: \"Don't Answer Me\" \u2013 No. 15\n  * 1984: \"Prime Time\" \u2013 No. 34\n\n### Canadian singles\n\n  * 1976: \"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" \u2013 No. 62\n  * 1977: \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" \u2013 No. 22\n  * 1980: \"Damned If I Do\" \u2013 No. 16\n  * 1981: \"Games People Play\" \u2013 No. 9\n  * 1981: \"Time\" \u2013 No. 30\n  * 1982: \"Eye in the Sky\" \u2013 No. 1\n  * 1983: \"You Don't Believe\" \u2013 No. 43\n  * 1984: \"Don't Answer Me\" \u2013 No. 20\n  * 1985: \"Let's Talk About Me\" \u2013 No. 89\n\n## Award Nominations\n\n### Nominations\n\n  * 1973 \u2013 Pink Floyd \u2013 The Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1975 \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1976 \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Somewhere I've Never Travelled \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1976 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Tales of Mystery and Imagination \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1978 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Pyramid \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1978 \u2013 Alan Parsons \u2013 Producer of the Year, Grammy Nomination for Producer of the Year\n  * 1979 \u2013 Ice Castles \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture\n  * 1979 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Eve \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1981 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 The Turn of a Friendly Card \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1982 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Eye in the Sky \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1986 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 \"Where's The Walrus?\" \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance\n  * 2007 \u2013 Alan Parsons \u2013 A Valid Path \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Surround Sound Album\n  * 2018 \u2013 Alan Parsons, Dave Donnelly, & PJ Olsson \u2013 \"Eye in the Sky \u2013 35th Anniversary Edition\" \u2013 Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album \u2013 \u2013 Alan Parsons, surround mix engineer; surround mastering engineers; Alan Parsons, surround producer (The Alan Parsons Project)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Alan Parsons Music Official Site\n  * Alan Parsons Project Official Site\n  * The Avenue, The Official Alan Parsons Fan Club\n  * Crawdaddy! \"Parsons Knows: The Tale of Alan Parsons and Edgar Allan Poe\"\n  * Alan Parsons NAMM Oral History Program Interview (2011)\n\n"

      "# Eye in the sky (camera)\n\nThe eye in the sky is a term given to casino and other commercial security\nclosed circuit cameras. In casinos, they are positioned to monitor seats,\ntables, hallways, restaurants, and even elevators closely. The functional\ncomponent is known as a pan\u2013tilt\u2013zoom camera, or a PTZ, an industry standard\nterm. The PTZ camera is covered by a semi-transparent plastic globe which\nmakes it nearly impossible to see which direction the camera is facing from a\ndistance. Retail stores often install empty globes, giving the appearance of\nadditional cameras. The camera is mounted on a series of interconnected gears\nand levers, which usually allow two axes of rotation. This rotation can either\nbe controlled manually by an operator using remote-control, or it can be\nautomated using motion sensing technology. In most commercial and civilian\napplications, both control methods are used simultaneously to allow automated\nsurveillance of general movement while allowing a manual over-ride mode to\nview specific subjects more closely. These cameras often help casino officials\njudge whether the person is card counting, which is popular in blackjack, past\nposting, and roulette. In case a crime or a cheat is detected after the fact,\nthe casino employees can review the recorded tapes and find the culprit. The\ncasino cameras are adjusted to focus on certain suspicious players by security\nworkers in a separate casino room with banks of security monitors. These types\nof cameras are also found in retail stores as well to monitor customers and\nemployees, such as Walmart or Target. They can also fool robbers into thinking\nthat there is a camera watching them and that they are being monitored by\nCCTV.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Casino security\n  * Closed-circuit television\n  * Panopticon\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# If I Ruled the World\n\n\"If I Ruled the World\" is a popular song, composed by Leslie Bricusse and\nCyril Ornadel, which was originally from the 1963 West End musical Pickwick\n(based on Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers). In the context of the stage\nmusical, the song is sung by Samuel Pickwick, when he is mistaken for an\nelection candidate and called on by the crowd to give his manifesto. Ornadel\nand Bricusse received the 1963 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and\nLyrically. The song is usually associated with Sir Harry Secombe, who got the\nsong to No 18 in the UK charts in 1963. Tony Bennett originally recorded the\nsong in 1965, and had a number 34 hit with it on the U.S. pop singles charts.\nWith Celine Dion, he returned to the song on his Grammy-winning 2006 album .\nIt has been performed by other singers, notably Robert Goulet, James Brown,\nStevie Wonder, The Supremes, Tom Jones and Regina Belle. Andy Hallett, the\nactor best known for playing the part of Lorne ('The Host') in the television\nseries Angel, sang the song in that series' final episode. The politician-\nspoofing BBC panel show If I Ruled the World was named after the song. This\nsong was featured in Spring/Summer 2009 on the Vodafone adverts in the UK.\nJamie Cullum also recorded a version for his album The Pursuit, and performed\nit at his special performance at the Late Night Prom, number Prom 55, of The\nProms in London, with The Heritage Ensemble, on Thursday 26 August 2010\nbetween 22:15 and 13.45.

      "# Monday Night Football (British TV programme)\n\nMonday Night Football (MNF) (also known as Bet365 Monday Night Football for\nsponsorship reasons) is a British football programme on Sky Sports which\nbroadcasts live English football from the Premier League.\n\n## Original run\n\nSky television's acquisition of rights to broadcast live Premier League\nfootball from the start of the 1992\u201393 season saw them attempt innovations\nsuch as digital on-screen graphics (DOG) and Monday Night live games. The\nfirst Monday Night Football game broadcast was between Manchester City and\nQueens Park Rangers on 17 August 1992, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. To give the\nbroadcasts a different look to Sky's Super Sunday strand, the broadcaster\nintroduced the Sky Strikers, a dance troupe similar to American cheerleaders.\nThis pre-match and half-time entertainment was dropped after the first season.\nThe show had a number of different formats after its launch. The first change\nled to the merging of Andy Gray's Boot Room format into the show; analysing\nthe previous weekend's football matches utilising the latest computer\ntechnology combined with Gray's individual analysis. As the UEFA Champions\nLeague gained in importance for Premier League clubs, the number of games\nplayed on Monday night declined. Sky Sports then reverted to a format similar\nto that of Ford Super Sunday with a presenter (Jeff Stelling) and studio\nguests. In 2004\u201305, the analysis section was then incorporated into an\nadditional programme shown after Ford Super Sunday called Ford Super Sunday:\nThe Last Word. The show ended after the 2006\u201307 season when Setanta and\nsubsequently ESPN obtained the rights for Monday night Premier League games.\n\n## Current run\n\nMonday Night Football returned from the 2010\u201311 season after Sky regained the\nrights to Monday night Premier League games. The games broadcast kick off at\n8:00 pm on Monday nights. The show also started broadcasting in high-\ndefinition. Due to the structure of the broadcasting packages for the 2010\u201313\nseasons, Sky broadcast a minimum of 12 live Premier League games on Monday\nnights. Before the departures of Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the programme had\na different appearance to Super Sunday, presented by Keys and Gray from a\npurpose-built studio with Andy Gray's analysis also returning from its Sunday\nevening slot. After the pair's unscheduled departure from Sky in January 2011,\nthe first half-hour of analysis was dropped, and for the remainder of the\nseason the show was presented from the stadium in largely the same format as\nSunday or midweek Premier League matches with a rotation of presenters and\npundits, although the distinct \"MNF\" branding and graphics were retained. Ed\nChamberlin was given the presenting role for the 2011\u201312 season, with Gary\nNeville as the new analyst. The show also returned to its previous format in\nthe purpose-built analysis studio, with Chamberlin and Neville carrying out\nthe same roles as Keys and Gray the previous season. In 2013, Jamie Carragher\njoined the Monday Night Football show, to form a regular three-man line-up\nalongside Chamberlin and Neville, after having announced his retirement from\nfootball at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. The first Monday Night Football of\nthe 2013-14 season and Jamie Carragher's first appearance aired on 19 August\n2013 with the Manchester City against Newcastle United game. Manchester City\nwon the game 4\u20130. Following Neville's appointment as head coach of Valencia in\nDecember 2015, he left the show to focus on his managerial duties. After\nleaving Valencia in March 2016 due to a poor run of results, Neville's return\nto Sky in his previous role was confirmed on 10 August 2016 ahead of the\n2016\u201317 Premier League football season; he made his on-air return on 14\nAugust. David Jones also took over as anchor presenter from Chamberlin who had\nleft Sky to take over ITV's horse racing coverage.\n\n## Presenters\n\n  * 1992\u20132003, 2010\u20132011: Richard Keys\n  * 2003\u20132005: Ian Payne\n  * 2005\u20132007: Jeff Stelling\n  * 2011\u20132016: Ed Chamberlin\n  * 2016\u2013present: David Jones\n\n## References\n\n",

He has\nbeen nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, with his first win occurring in 2019 for\nBest Immersive Audio Album, Eye in the Sky (35th Anniversary Edition).\n\n## Career\n\nIn October 1967, at the age of 18, Parsons went to work as an assistant\nengineer at Abbey Road Studios, where he earned his first credit on the LP\nAbbey Road. He became a regular there, engineering such projects as Wings'\nWild Life and Red Rose Speedway, five albums by the Hollies, and Pink Floyd's\nThe Dark Side of the Moon, for which he received his first Grammy Award\nnomination. He was known for doing more than what would normally be considered\nthe scope of a recording engineer's duties. Parsons considered himself to be a\nrecording director, likening his contribution to recordings to what Stanley\nKubrick contributed to film. This is apparent in his work with Al Stewart's\n\"Year of the Cat\", where Parsons added the saxophone part and transformed the\noriginal folk concept into the jazz-influenced ballad that put Stewart onto\nthe charts. It is also heard in Parsons' influence on the Hollies' \"He Ain't\nHeavy, He's My Brother\" and \"The Air That I Breathe\". Parsons also produced\nthree albums by Pilot, a Scottish pop rock band consisting of Ian Bairnson on\nguitar, Stuart Tosh on drums, and David Paton on lead vocals, guitars, bass\nand William (Billy) Lyall, on piano and keys. Their hits included \"January\"\nand \"Magic\". He also mixed the debut album by the American band Ambrosia and\nproduced their second album Somewhere I've Never Travelled. Parsons was\nnominated for a Grammy Award for both albums. In 1975, he declined Pink\nFloyd's invitation to work on the follow-up for Dark Side, Wish You Were Here,\nand instead initiated the Alan Parsons Project with producer, songwriter, and\noccasional singer Eric Woolfson, whom he had met at Abbey Road. The Project\nconsisted of a revolving group of studio musicians and vocalists, most notably\nthe members of Pilot and (on the first album) the members of Ambrosia. Unlike\nmost rock groups, the Alan Parsons Project never performed live during its\nheyday, although it did release several music videos. Its only live\nperformance during its original incarnation was in 1990. It released ten\nalbums, the last in 1987. The Project terminated in 1990 after Parsons and\nWoolfson split, with the Project's intended 11th album released that year as a\nWoolfson solo album. Parsons continued to release work in his own name and in\ncollaboration with other musicians. Parsons and his band regularly toured many\nparts of the world. Although an accomplished vocalist, keyboardist, bassist,\nguitarist and flautist, Parsons only sang infrequent and incidental parts on\nhis albums, such as the background vocals on \"Time\". While his keyboard\nplaying was very audible on the Alan Parsons Project albums, very few\nrecordings feature his flute. He briefly returned to run Abbey Road Studios in\nits entirety. Parsons also continued with his selective production work for\nother bands. Of all his collaborators, guitarist Ian Bairnson worked with\nParsons the longest, including Parsons' post-Project albums, Try Anything\nOnce, On Air, and The Time Machine. In 1998, Parsons became Vice-President of\nEMI Studios Group, including the Abbey Road Studios. He soon left the post,\ndeciding to return to more creative endeavours. Parsons remained as a creative\nconsultant and associate producer for the group. As well as receiving gold and\nplatinum awards from many nations, Parsons has received ten Grammy Award\nnominations for engineering and production. In 2007 he received a nomination\nfor Best Surround Sound Album for A Valid Path. Beginning in 2001 and\nextending for four years, Parsons conceived and led a Beatles tribute show\ncalled A Walk Down Abbey Road featuring a group of headlining performers such\nas Todd Rundgren, Ann Wilson of Heart, John Entwistle of the Who, and Jack\nBruce of Cream. The show structure included a first set where all musicians\nassembled to perform each other's hits, and a second set featuring all Beatles\nsongs. Since 1999 he has toured under a revised name, the Alan Parsons Live\nProject (with Woolfson's permission). The band currently features lead singer\nP. J. Olsson, guitarist Jeff Kollman, drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist Tom\nBrooks, bass guitarist Guy Erez, vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper,\nguitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey, along with Parsons on rhythm guitar,\nkeyboards and vocals. This band performed live in Medell\u00edn, Colombia in 2013\nas Alan Parsons Symphonic Project in a performance recorded for Colombian\ntelevision and also released on CD (live 2-CD) and DVD (May 2016). In May\n2005, Parsons appeared at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, California, to mix\nfront-of-house sound for Southern California-based Pink Floyd tribute band\nWhich One's Pink? and their performance of The Dark Side of the Moon in its\nentirety. In 2010, Parsons released his single \"All Our Yesterdays\" through\nAuthentik Artists. Parsons also launched a DVD educational series in 2010\ntitled The Art and Science of Sound Recording (ASSR) on music production and\nthe complete audio recording process. The single \"All Our Yesterdays\" was\nwritten and recorded during the making of ASSR. The series, narrated by Billy\nBob Thornton, gives detailed tutorials on virtually every aspect of the sound\nrecording process. During 2010, several media reports, one of which included a\nquote from a representative of Parsons, alleged that the song \"Need You Now\"\nby country music group Lady Antebellum used the melody and arrangement of \"Eye\nin the Sky\". Parsons produced Jake Shimabukuro's album, Grand Ukulele, which\nwas released on 2 October 2012. Also in 2012, he contributed lead vocals and\nperformed keyboards and guitar on the track \"Precious Life\" by German\nelectronic music duo Lichtmond, and appeared with many other noted\nprogressive-rock musicians on The Prog Collective album by Billy Sherwood,\nsinging lead on \"The Technical Divide.\" Parsons engineered the third solo\nalbum by Steven Wilson, The Raven that Refused to Sing (And Other Stories),\nreleased on 25 February 2013. In late 2013, a live album recorded on tour in\nGermany and Austria with the title LiveSpan was released, accompanied by a\nsingle called \"Fragile\" with Simon Philips on drums. Legacy Recordings, the\ncatalogue division of Sony Music Entertainment, celebrated the 35th\nanniversary of Eye in the Sky, with the worldwide release of a definitive\ndeluxe collector's box set, featuring rare and unreleased material, on 17\nNovember 2017. In August 2018, Parsons announced that he will be releasing a\nstudio album in 2019. \u201cThe Secret\u201d was his first album in 15 years.\n\n## Personal life\n\nParsons was born in London. He resides in Santa Barbara, California, with his\nwife Lisa and her two daughters, Tabitha and Brittni, as well as numerous\npets. He has two sons, Jeremy (Jerry) and Daniel, from his previous marriage.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Full discography\n\n### Billboard Top 40 hit singles (US)\n\n  * 1976: \"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" \u2013 No. 37\n  * 1977: \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" \u2013 No. 36\n  * 1979: \"Damned If I Do\" \u2013 No. 27\n  * 1980: \"Games People Play\" \u2013 No. 16\n  * 1981: \"Time\" \u2013 No. 15\n  * 1982: \"Eye in the Sky\" \u2013 No. 3\n  * 1984: \"Don't Answer Me\" \u2013 No. 15\n  * 1984: \"Prime Time\" \u2013 No. 34\n\n### Canadian singles\n\n  * 1976: \"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" \u2013 No. 62\n  * 1977: \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" \u2013 No. 22\n  * 1980: \"Damned If I Do\" \u2013 No. 16\n  * 1981: \"Games People Play\" \u2013 No. 9\n  * 1981: \"Time\" \u2013 No. 30\n  * 1982: \"Eye in the Sky\" \u2013 No. 1\n  * 1983: \"You Don't Believe\" \u2013 No. 43\n  * 1984: \"Don't Answer Me\" \u2013 No. 20\n  * 1985: \"Let's Talk About Me\" \u2013 No. 89\n\n## Award Nominations\n\n### Nominations\n\n  * 1973 \u2013 Pink Floyd \u2013 The Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1975 \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1976 \u2013 Ambrosia \u2013 Somewhere I've Never Travelled \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1976 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Tales of Mystery and Imagination \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1978 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Pyramid \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1978 \u2013 Alan Parsons \u2013 Producer of the Year, Grammy Nomination for Producer of the Year\n  * 1979 \u2013 Ice Castles \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture\n  * 1979 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Eve \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1981 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 The Turn of a Friendly Card \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1982 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 Eye in the Sky \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical\n  * 1986 \u2013 The Alan Parsons Project \u2013 \"Where's The Walrus?\" \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance\n  * 2007 \u2013 Alan Parsons \u2013 A Valid Path \u2013 Grammy Nomination for Best Surround Sound Album\n  * 2018 \u2013 Alan Parsons, Dave Donnelly, & PJ Olsson \u2013 \"Eye in the Sky \u2013 35th Anniversary Edition\" \u2013 Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album \u2013 \u2013 Alan Parsons, surround mix engineer; surround mastering engineers; Alan Parsons, surround producer (The Alan Parsons Project)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Alan Parsons Music Official Site\n  * Alan Parsons Project Official Site\n  * The Avenue, The Official Alan Parsons Fan Club\n  * Crawdaddy! \"Parsons Knows: The Tale of Alan Parsons and Edgar Allan Poe\"\n  * Alan Parsons NAMM Oral History Program Interview (2011)\n\n"

    "question": "Where does diffusion occur in the amphibian excretory system?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Excretory system\n\nThe excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess,\nunnecessary materials from the body fluids of an organism, so as to help\nmaintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. The\ndual function of excretory systems is the elimination of the waste products of\nmetabolism and to drain the body of used up and broken down components in a\nliquid and gaseous state. In humans and other amniotes (mammals, birds and\nreptiles) most of these substances leave the body as urine and to some degree\nexhalation, mammals also expel them through sweating. Only the organs\nspecifically used for the excretion are considered a part of the excretory\nsystem. In the narrow sense, the term refer to the urinary system. However, as\nexcretion involves several functions that are only superficially related, it\nis not usually used in more formal classifications of anatomy or function. As\nmost healthy functioning organs produce metabolic and other wastes, the entire\norganism depends on the function of the system. Breaking down of one of more\nof the systems is a serious health condition, for example kidney failure.\n\n## Systems\n\n### Urinary system\n\nThe kidneys are large, bean-shaped organs which are present on each side of\nthe vertebral column in the abdominal cavity. Humans have two kidneys and each\nkidney is supplied with blood from the renal artery. The kidneys remove from\nthe blood the nitrogenous wastes such as urea, as well as salts and excess\nwater, and excrete them in the form of urine. This is done with the help of\nmillions of nephrons present in the kidney. The filtrated blood is carried\naway from the kidneys by the renal vein (or kidney vein). The urine from the\nkidney is collected by the ureter (or excretory tubes), one from each kidney,\nand is passed to the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder collects and stores\nthe urine until urination. The urine collected in the bladder is passed into\nthe external environment from the body through an opening called the urethra.\n\n#### Kidneys\n\nThe kidney's primary function is the elimination of waste from the bloodstream\nby production of urine. They perform several homeostatic functions such as:-\n\n  1. Maintain volume of extracellular fluid\n  2. Maintain ionic balance in extracellular fluid\n  3. Maintain pH and osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid.\n  4. Excrete toxic metabolic by-products such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid. \nThe way the kidneys do this is with nephrons. There are over 1 million\nnephrons in each kidney; these nephrons act as filters inside the kidneys. The\nkidneys filter needed materials and waste, the needed materials go back into\nthe bloodstream, and unneeded materials becomes urine and is gotten rid of. In\nsome cases, excess wastes crystallize as kidney stones. They grow and can\nbecome painful irritants that may require surgery or ultrasound treatments.\nSome stones are small enough to be forced into the urethra.\n\n#### Ureter\n\nThe ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine from the kidneys to the\nurinary bladder. In the human adult, the ureters are usually 25\u201330 cm (10\u201312\nin) long. In humans, the ureters arise from the renal pelvis on the medial\naspect of each kidney before descending towards the bladder on the front of\nthe psoas major muscle. The ureters cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation\nof the iliac arteries (which they run over). This \"pelviureteric junction\" is\na common site for the impaction of kidney stones (the other being the\nuteterovesical valve). The ureters run posteriorly on the lateral walls of the\npelvis. They then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the\nback, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder\nfor a few centimeters. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as\nureterovesical valves. In the female, the ureters pass through the mesometrium\non the way to the bladder.\n\n#### Urinary bladder\n\nThe urinary bladder is the organ that collects waste excreted by the kidneys\nprior to disposal by urination. It is a hollow muscular, and distensible (or\nelastic) organ, and sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the\nureters and exits via the urethra. Embryologically, the bladder is derived\nfrom the urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois.\nIn human males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic\nsymphysis. It is superior to the prostate, and separated from the rectum by\nthe rectovesical excavation. In females, the bladder sits inferior to the\nuterus and anterior to the vagina. It is separated from the uterus by the\nvesicouterine excavation. In infants and young children, the urinary bladder\nis in the abdomen even when empty.\n\n#### Urethra\n\nIn anatomy, the (from Greek \u2013 ourethra) is a tube which connects the urinary\nbladder to the outside of the body. In humans, the urethra has an excretory\nfunction in both genders to pass.\n\n### Respiratory system\n\nOne of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as\ncarbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration.\n\n### Gastrointestinal tract\n\nThe large intestine's main function is to transport food particles through the\nbody and expel the indigestible parts at the other end, but it also collects\nwaste from throughout the body. The typical brown colour of mammal waste is\ndue to bilirubin, a breakdown product of normal heme catabolism. The lower\npart of the large intestine also extracts any remaining usable water and then\nremoves solid waste. At about 10 feet long in humans, it transports the wastes\nthrough the tubes to be excreted.\n\n### Biliary system\n\nThe liver detoxifies and breaks down chemicals, poisons and other toxins that\nenter the body. For example, the liver transforms ammonia (which is poisonous)\ninto urea in fish, amphibians and mammals, and into uric acid in birds and\nreptiles. Urea is filtered by the kidney into urine or through the gills in\nfish and tadpoles. Uric acid is paste-like and expelled as a semi-solid waste\n(the \"white\" in bird excrements). The liver also produces bile, and the body\nuses bile to break down fats into usable fats and unusable waste.\nInvertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects,\npossesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions. Marine\ninvertebrates do not need the ammonia conversion of the liver, as they can\nusually expel ammonia directly by diffusion through the skin.\n\n### Integumentary system\n\n#### Skin\n\nSweat glands in the skin secrete a fluid waste called sweat or perspiration;\nhowever, its primary functions are temperature control and pheromone release.\nTherefore, its role as a part of the excretory system is minimal. Sweating\nalso maintains the level of salt in the body. In mammals, the skin excretes\nsweat through sweat glands throughout the body. The sweat, helped by salt,\nevaporates and helps to keep the body cool when it is warm. In amphibians, the\nlungs are very simple, and they lack the necessary means to the exhale like\nother tetrapods can. The moist, scale-less skin is therefore essential in\nhelping to rid the blood of carbon dioxide, and also allows for urea to be\nexpelled through diffusion when submerged. In small-bodied marine\ninvertebrates, the skin is the most important excretory organ. That is\nparticularly true for acoelomate groups like cnidarians, flatworms and\nnemerteans, who have no body cavities and hence no body fluid that can be\ndrained or purified by nephrons, which is the reason acoelomate animals are\nthread-like (nemertans), flat (flatworms) or only consist of a thin layer of\ncells around a gelatinous non-cellular interior (cnidarians).\n\n#### Eccrine\n\nLike sweat glands, eccrine glands allow excess water to leave the body. The\nmajority of eccrine glands are located mainly on the forehead, the bottoms of\nthe feet, and the palms, although the glands are everywhere throughout the\nbody. They help the body to maintain temperature control. Eccrine glands in\nthe skin are unique to mammals. Secretions of sweat from the eccrine glands\nplay a large role in controlling the body temperature of humans. Regulation of\nbody temperature, also known as thermoregulation, is very important when it\ncomes to instances that bring the body\u2019s temperature outside of the\nhomeostatic temperature such as with a fever or even exercise. Together these\nglands make up the size of about one kidney and in one day a human can\nperspire amounts as much as 10 liters. The two functions consist of secretion\nof a filtrate in response to acetylcholine and reabsorption of sodium near the\nduct when there is water in excess so that a sweat can be surfacing the skin.\nThere are three parts to the eccrine sweat gland and these are the pore, the\nduct, and the gland. The pore is the portion that goes through the outermost\nlayer of the skin and is typically 5-10 microns in diameter. The duct is the\npart of the sweat gland that connects dermis cells to the epidermis. It is\ncomposed by two layers of cells and is between 10 and 20 microns in diameter.\nThe gland does the actual secretion and it lies deep within the dermis. The\ncells that make up the gland are larger in size than the duct cells and its\nlumen is around 20 microns in diameter.\n\n## Substances\n\n### Bile\n\nAfter bile is produced in the liver, it is stored in the gall bladder. It is\nthen secreted within the small intestine where it helps to emulsify fats in\nthe same manner as a soap. Bile also contains bilirubin, which is a waste\nproduct. Bile salts can be considered waste that is useful for the body given\nthat they have a role in fat absorption from the stomach. They are excreted\nfrom the liver and along with blood flow they help to form the shape of the\nliver where they are excreted. For instance, if biliary drainage is impaired\nthan that part of the liver will end up wasting away. Biliary obstruction is\ntypically due to masses blocking the ducts of the system such as tumors. The\nconsequences of this depend on the site of blockage and how long it goes on\nfor. There is inflammation of the ducts due to the irritation from the bile\nacids and this can cause infections. If rupture of the duct takes place it is\nvery traumatic and even fatal.\n\n### Urine\n\nWithin the kidney, blood first passes through the afferent artery to the\ncapillary formation called a glomerulus and is collected in the Bowman's\ncapsule, which filters the blood from its contents\u2014primarily food and wastes.\nAfter the filtration process, the blood then returns to collect the food\nnutrients it needs, while the wastes pass into the collecting duct, to the\nrenal pelvis, and to the ureter, and are then secreted out of the body via the\nurinary bladder.\n\n### Faeces\n\n### Sweat\n\n### Breath\n\n## Clinical signifiance\n\n### Kidney Stones\n\nScientifically, masses referred to as a renal calculus or nephrolith, or more\ncommonly, \u201ckidney stones,\u201d are solid masses of crystals that may be a variety\nof shapes, sizes, and textures, that can reside within one or both of the\nkidneys. Kidney stones form when the balance is off between the concentration\nof substances that pass through urine, and the substances that are supposed to\ndissolve them. When substances are not properly dissolved, they have the\nability to build up, and form these kidney stones. These stones are most\ncommonly made up of substances such as calcium, cystine, oxalate, and uric\nacid, as these are the substances that normally would dissolve within the\nurine. When they do not dissolve correctly and further build up, they will\ncommonly lodge themselves in the urinary tract and in this case, are usually\nsmall enough to pass through urine. In extreme situations, however, these\nstones may lodge themselves within the tube that connects the kidney and the\nbladder, called the ureter. In this case, they become very large in size and\nwill most likely cause great pain, bleeding, and possibly even block the flow\nof urine. These can occur in both men and women, and studies show that around\n12% of men, and 8% of women in America will develop kidney stones within their\nlifetime.\n\n#### Treatment\n\nIn those extreme situations, in which kidney stones are too large to pass on\ntheir own, patients may seek removal. Most of these treatments involving\nkidney stone removal are done by a urologist; a physician who specializes in\nthe organs of the Urinary system. A common way of removal is shock wave\nlithotripsy, in which the urologist will shock the kidney stone into smaller\npieces via laser, allowing these pieces to further pass through the urine on\ntheir own, as a normal case of kidney stones. Larger, more serious cases may\ndemand Cystoscopy, Ureteroscopy, or Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy, in which the\ndoctor will use a viewing tool or camera to locate the stone, and based on the\nsize or situation, may either chose to continue with surgical removal, or use\nthe shock wave lithotripsy treatment. Once the kidney stone(s) are\nsuccessfully eliminated, the urologist will commonly suggest medication to\nprevent future recurrences.\n\n### Pyelonephritis\n\nPyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection that occurs when bacteria\nenters the body through the urinary tract. It causes an inflammation of the\nrenal parenchyma, calyces, and pelvis. There are three main classifications of\npyelonephritis: acute, chronic and xanthogranulomatous.\n\n#### Acute Pyelonephritis\n\nIn acute pyelonephritis, the patient experiences high fever, abdominal pain\nand pain while passing urine. Treatment for acute pyelonephritis is provided\nvia antibiotics and an extensive urological investigation is conducted to find\nany abnormalities and prevent recurrence.\n\n#### Chronic Pyelonephritis\n\nIn chronic pyelonephritis, patients experience persistent abdominal and flank\npain, high fever, decreased appetite, weight loss, urinary tract symptoms and\nblood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can also lead to scarring of the\nrenal parenchyma caused by recurrent kidney infections.\n\n#### Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an unusual form of chronic\npyelonephritis. It results in severe destruction of the kidney and causes\ngranulomatous abscess formation. Patients infected with Xanthogranulomatous\npyelonephritis experience recurrent fevers, anemia, kidney stones and loss of\nfunction in the affected kidney.\n\n#### Treatment\n\nA urine culture and antibiotics sensitivity test is issued for patients who\nare believed to have pyelonephritis. Since most cases of pyelonephritis are\ncaused from bacterial infections, antibiotics are a common treatment option.\nDepending on the species of the infecting organism and the antibiotics\nsensitivity profile of the organism, treatments may include fluoroquinolones,\ncephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim individually or in\ncombination. For patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, treatment\nmight include antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the most common\nsurgical treatment for a majority of cases involving xanthogranulomatous\npyelonephritis.\n\n#### Epidemiology\n\nIn men, roughly 2-3 cases per 10,000 are treated as outpatients and 1 in\n10,000 cases require admission to the hospital. In women, approximately 12-13\nin 10,000 cases are treated as outpatients and 3-4 cases are admitted to a\nhospital. The most common age group affected by Xanthogranulomatous\npyelonephritis is middle-aged women. Infants and elderly are also at an\nincreased risk because of hormonal and anatomical changes.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * CLC Biology: Excretory/Urinary System\n  * The Franklin Institute: Excretory System\n\n"

      "# Automotive navigation system\n\nAn automotive navigation system is part of the automobile controls or a third\nparty add-on used to find direction in an automobile. It typically uses a\nsatellite navigation device to get its position data which is then correlated\nto a position on a road. When directions are needed routing can be calculated.\nOn the fly traffic information can be used to adjust the route. Dead reckoning\nusing distance data from sensors attached to the drivetrain, a gyroscope and\nan accelerometer can be used for greater reliability, as GPS signal loss\nand/or multipath can occur due to urban canyons or tunnels. Mathematically,\nautomotive navigation is based on the shortest path problem, within graph\ntheory, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria\n(shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc.) between two points in a large network.\nAutomotive navigation systems are a crucial for the development of self-\ndriving cars.\n\n## History\n\nAutomotive navigation systems represent a convergence of a number of diverse\ntechnologies many of which have been available for many years, but were too\ncostly or inaccessible. Limitations such as batteries, display, and processing\npower had to be overcome before the product became commercially viable.\n\n  * 1961: Hidetsugu Yagi designed a wireless-based navigation system. This design was still primitive and intended for military-use.\n  * 1966: General Motors Research (GMR) was working on a non-satellite-based navigation and assistance system called DAIR (Driver Aid, Information & Routing). After initial tests GM found that it was not a scalable or practical way to provide navigation assistance. Decades later, however, the concept would be reborn as OnStar (founded 1996).\n  * 1973: Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and Fuji Heavy Industries sponsored CATC (Comprehensive Automobile Traffic Control), a Japanese research project on automobile navigation systems.\n  * 1979: MITI established JSK (Association of Electronic Technology for Automobile Traffic and Driving) in Japan.\n  * 1980: Electronic Auto Compass with new mechanism on the Toyota Crown.\n  * 1981: The earlier research of CATC leads to the first generation of automobile navigation systems from Japanese companies Honda, Nissan and Toyota. They used dead reckoning technology.\n  * 1981: Honda's Electro Gyro-Cator was the first commercially available car navigation system. It used inertial navigation systems, which tracked the distance traveled, the start point, and direction headed. It was also the first with a map display.\n  * 1981: Navigation computer on the Toyota Celica (NAVICOM).\n  * 1983: Etak was founded. It made an early system that used map-matching to improve on dead reckoning instrumentation. Digital map information was stored on standard cassette tapes.\n  * 1987: Toyota introduced the World's first CD-ROM-based navigation system on the Toyota Crown.\n  * 1989: Gregg Howe of Design Works USA applied Hunter Systems $40,000 navigational computer to the Magna Torrero Concept Car. Originally developed to locate hydrants for fire departments, this system utilized both satellite signals & dead reckoning improving overall system accuracy due to civilian GPS limitations. This system also boast a color rasterscan monitor, rather than the monochromatic vector mapping displays used by predecessors.\n\n",
      "# Meeting\n\nA meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more\ntopics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a\nvariety of other environments. Many various types of meetings exist.\n\n## Definition\n\nA meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the\npurpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing\ninformation or reaching agreement. Meetings may occur face-to-face or\nvirtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone\nconference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference. One Merriam-\nWebster dictionary defines a meeting as \"an act or process of coming together\"\n- for example \"as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]\". Meeting\nplanners and other meeting professionals may use the term \"meeting\" to denote\nan event booked at a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to\nsuch gatherings.\n\n## Types of meetings\n\nThe term \"meeting\" may refer to a lecture (one presentation), seminar\n(typically several presentations, small audience, one day), conference (mid-\nsize, one or more days), congress (large, several days), exhibition or trade\nshow (with manned stands being visited by passers-by), workshop (smaller, with\nactive participants), training course, team-building session and kick-off\nevent. Common types of meeting include:\n\n  * Committee meeting, a coming-together of a defined subset of an organization\n  * Investigative meeting, generally when conducting a pre-interview, exit interview or a meeting among the investigator and representative\n  * Kickoff meeting, the first meeting with a project team and the client of the project to discuss the role of each team-member\n  * Town hall meeting, an informal public gathering.\n  * Work meeting, which produces a product or intangible result such as a decision; compare working group.\n\nOther varieties include breakfast meetings off-site meetings (or Awayday\nmeetings in the UK), and \"stand-up meetings\" where participants stand up to\nencourage brevity. Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting\norganizer has to determine the repetition and frequency of occurrence of the\nmeeting: one-time, recurring meeting, or a series meeting such as a monthly\n\"lunch and learn\" event at a company, church, club or organization in which\nthe placeholder is the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary. In\nRussian, a \"flying meeting\" () is a hastily-called brief meeting.\n\n## See also\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n  * 112 pages.\n\n",
      "# Heartbeat (computing)\n\nIn computer science, a heartbeat is a periodic signal generated by hardware or\nsoftware to indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a\ncomputer system. Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular\ninterval in the order of seconds. If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat\nfor a time\u2014usually a few heartbeat intervals\u2014the machine that should have sent\nthe heartbeat is assumed to have failed.\n\n## Heartbeat protocol\n\nA heartbeat protocol is generally used to negotiate and monitor the\navailability of a resource, such as a floating IP address. Typically when a\nheartbeat starts on a machine, it will perform an election process with other\nmachines on the heartbeat network to determine which machine, if any, owns the\nresource. On heartbeat networks of more than two machines, it is important to\ntake into account partitioning, where two halves of the network could be\nfunctioning but not able to communicate with each other. In a situation such\nas this, it is important that the resource is only owned by one machine, not\none machine in each partition. As a heartbeat is intended to be used to\nindicate the health of a machine, it is important that the heartbeat protocol\nand the transport that it runs on is as reliable as possible. Causing a\nfailover because of a false alarm may, depending on the resource, be highly\nundesirable. It is also important to react quickly to an actual failure, so\nagain it is important that the heartbeat is reliable. For this reason it is\noften desirable to have heartbeat running over more than one transport; for\ninstance, an Ethernet segment using UDP/IP, and a serial link.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Watchdog timer, electronic timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions\n  * Keepalive, a common generalization of this feature in various protocols\n  * Heartbleed vulnerability\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Marco Polo (game)\n\nMarco Polo is an American form of tag played in a swimming pool.\n\n## Rules\n\nOne player is chosen as \"It\". The \"It\" player, with closed eyes, tries to find\nand tag any one of the other players, relying on hearing to find someone to\ntag. The player who is \"It\" shouts \"Marco\" and the other players must all\nrespond by shouting \"Polo\", which \"It\" uses to try to find them. If a player\nis tagged, then that player becomes \"It.\" If \"It\" suspects that a player has\nleft the pool, they can shout \"Fish out of water!\" and the player who is out\nof the pool becomes the new \"It\". The game can also be played on land, with\nslightly modified rules. It is similar to blind man's buff, where one person\nis blindfolded while others choose hiding places around the room. While\nplaying one cannot hold another player in place to be tagged or that person is\nit.\n\n## History\n\nThe game shares its name with the 13th-century Italian trader and explorer\nMarco Polo. There does not appear to be any real connection between the game\nand the explorer of the same name, although according to one whimsical\nexplanation, \"legend has it that the famed explorer didn't really have a clue\nas to where he was going\", this being reflected in the \"It\" player's behavior.\nAlthough water polo is another popular pool game, the name of 'Marco Polo' is\napparently unrelated. The game has similar traits with blind man's buff, an\nessentially identical game played on dry land which dates back to at least the\n16th century. Marco Polo was known as a water game in America by the 1960s.\nBetween 1965 and 1970, some respondents to a Dictionary of American Regional\nEnglish survey, when asked to name a game played in the water, responded with\n\"Marco Polo.\" In modern times, Marco Polo is played worldwide. Various regions\nhave their own versions of the game, with names such as Mermaid on the Rocks\nand Alligator. The term \"Marco Polo game\" is sometimes used to describe an\nonline game where a similar call-and-response system of gameplay is adopted.\n\n## Analysis\n\nMarco Polo is an \"easily modifiable game\", and is based on the notion of call-\nand-response. Marco Polo is not a location-based game because players are\nconfined to a set space and because players must locate each other using\nauditory clues. Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society argues \"there is\nbipolarity in the reversal of roles...there are repeated actions, a routine to\nbe repeated, rules to be observed, and verbal signs to be used\". Playing this\ngame can allow children to experiment with different social roles, for example\nlearning what it means to be an outcast in the role of \"It\" (isolated,\nconfined to a space, and unable to see others). According to the Nevada\nRegional Medical Center, \"Marco Polo is not only fun, it can be a good\nworkout. It also puts less stress on your bones and joints because the water\nmakes your body float.\"\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Fourth heart sound\n\nThe fourth heart sound or S is an extra heart sound that occurs during late\ndiastole, immediately before the normal two \"lub-dub\" heart sounds (S and S).\nIt occurs just after atrial contraction and immediately before the systolic S\nand is caused by the atria contracting forcefully in an effort to overcome an\nabnormally stiff or hypertrophic ventricle. This produces a rhythm classically\ncompared to the cadence of the word \"Tennessee.\" One can also use the phrase\n\"A-stiff-wall\" to help with the cadence (a S, stiff S, wall S), as well as the\npathology of the S sound.\n\n## Physiology\n\nThe normal heart sounds, S and S, are produced during the closing of the\natrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. The closing of\nthese valves produces a brief period of turbulent flow, which produces sound.\nThe S sound occurs, by definition, immediately before S, while the atria of\nthe heart are vigorously contracting. It is manifest as a vibration of 20 to\n30 Hz within the ventricle. While the mechanism is not absolutely certain, it\nis generally accepted that S is caused by stiffening of the walls of the\nventricles (usually the left), which produces abnormally turbulent flow as the\natria contract to force blood into the ventricle. S is sometimes audible in\nthe elderly due to a more rigid ventricle. When loud, it is a sign of a\npathologic state, usually a failing left ventricle. If the problem lies with\nthe left ventricle, the gallop rhythm will be heard best at the cardiac apex.\nIt will become more apparent with exercise, with the patient lying on the\nleft-hand side, or with the patient holding expiration. If the problem is in\nthe right ventricle, the abnormal sound will be most evident on the lower left\nhand side of the sternum and will get louder with exercise and quick, deep\ninspiration. S has also been termed an atrial gallop or a presystolic gallop\nbecause of its occurrence late in the heart cycle. It is a type of gallop\nrhythm by virtue of having an extra sound; the other gallop rhythm is called\nS. The two are quite different, but they may sometimes occur together forming\na quadruple gallop. If the heart rate is also very fast (tachycardia), it can\nbecome difficult to distinguish between S and S thus producing a single sound\ncalled a summation gallop.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThe S4 heart sound itself does not require treatment; rather plans should be\nlaid to stop the progression of whatever causes the underlying ventricular\ndysfunction. The S4 heart sound is a secondary manifestation of a primary\ndisease process and treatment should be focused on treating the underlying,\nprimary disease.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

An extended\nversion, called the \"Special Disco Version\", was released as the band's first\ndance remix on a 12-inch single.\n\n## Inspiration and recording\n\n\"Miss You\" was written by Mick Jagger jamming with keyboardist Billy Preston\nduring rehearsals for the March 1977 El Mocambo club gigs, recordings from\nwhich appeared on side three of double live album Love You Live (1977).

Jagger and Ronnie Wood\ninsist that \"Miss You\" wasn't conceived as a disco song, while Richards said,\n\"...'Miss You' was a damn good disco record; it was calculated to be one.\" In\nany case, what was going on in discotheques did make it to the recording.\nCharlie Watts said, \"A lot of those songs like 'Miss You' on 'Some Girls'...\nwere heavily influenced by going to the discos. You can hear it in a lot of\nthose four-to-the-floor and the Philadelphia-style drumming.\" For the bass\npart, Bill Wyman started from Preston's bass guitar on the song demo. Chris\nKimsey, who engineered the recording, said Wyman went \"...to quite a few clubs\nbefore he got that bass line sorted out\", which Kimsey said \"made that song.\"\nWyman recalled: \"When I did the riff for 'Miss You' \u2013 which made the song, and\nevery band in the world copied it for the next year: Rod Stewart, all of them\n\u2013 it still said Jagger/Richard. When I wrote the riff for 'Jumpin' Jack\nFlash', it became Jagger/Richard, and that's the way it was. It just became\npart and parcel of the way the band functioned.\" Jagger sang a good part of\nthe chorus using falsetto \"ooh\"s often in unison with harmonica, guitar and\nelectric piano. Unlike most of Some Girls, \"Miss You\" features several studio\nmusicians. In addition to Sugar Blue who, according to Wood, was found by\nJagger busking on the streets of Paris, Ian McLagan plays understated\nWurlitzer electric piano, and Mel Collins provides the tenor saxophone solo\nfor the instrumental break. The 12\" version of the song runs over eight\nminutes and features additional instrumentation and solos, particularly on\nguitar. It was remixed by Bob Clearmountain, then an up-and-coming mixer and\nengineer. This song, the first edit the Stones did for a 12\" single, also\ncontains tape repeats and an additional set of lyrics in the second verse,\nafter the line \"Hey, let's go mess and fool around you know, like we used to.\"\nThe extended version can be found on the \"Don't Stop\" CD single and in edited\nform on the album Rarities 1971\u20132003 and on the 1990 CD single version of\n\"Angie\".\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel per Some Girls CD credits.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n* Mick Jagger \u2013 lead and backing vocals, electric guitar\n* Keith Richards \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals\n* Ronnie Wood \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals\n* Bill Wyman \u2013 bass guitar\n* Charlie Watts \u2013 drums\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n* Ian McLagan \u2013 Wurlitzer electric piano\n* Mel Collins \u2013 tenor saxophone\n* Sugar Blue \u2013 harmonica\n\n## Release and legacy\n\n\"Miss You\" became The Rolling Stones' eighth and final number one hit in the\nUnited States on its initial release in 1978. It hit the top on 5 August 1978,\nending the seven-week reign of \"Shadow Dancing\" by Andy Gibb. It also reached\nnumber three in the United Kingdom. The song was originally nearly nine\nminutes long, but was edited to nearly five minutes for the album version, and\nto three-and-a-half minutes for the radio single. In order to properly edit\nthe radio single without audible bumps and glitches, a separate mix was\nconstructed and then edited for continuity. The B-side of the single was\nanother album track, \"Far Away Eyes\", a tongue-in-cheek country tune sung by\nJagger in a pronounced drawl. A live recording was captured during the Rolling\nStones' 1989-1990 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour and released on the 1991 live\nalbum Flashpoint. Other live versions have been recorded and/or filmed,\nincluding a November 1981 performance included on Let's Spend the Night\nTogether (1983), July 1995 performances released on Totally Stripped (2016), a\nJuly 2013 performance on Hyde Park Live, and a March 2016 performance included\nas a bonus track on .

      "# Look Away\n\n\"Look Away\" is a 1988 power ballad by American rock band Chicago. Written by\nDiane Warren, produced by Ron Nevison, and with Bill Champlin on lead vocals,\nit is the second single from the band's album Chicago 19. \"Look Away\" is\nChicago's largest selling single of all, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for two\nweeks in December 1988, matching the chart success of the group's \"If You\nLeave Me Now\" (1976) and \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\" (1982). \"Look Away\" is\nChicago's seventh song to have peaked at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart\nas well as the No. 1 song on the 1989 year-end Billboard Hot 100 chart, even\nthough it never held the No. 1 spot at all in 1989. The song, unlike hits from\nearly in Chicago's career, does not prominently feature horns. It is also the\nband's only No. 1 single following the 1985 departure of Peter Cetera.\n\n## Production\n\nAccording to drummer Danny Seraphine, Chicago's manager Howard Kaufman\nsuggested that the band bring in outside songwriting help. Kaufman recommended\nDiane Warren, who also composed the band's single \"I Don't Wanna Live Without\nYour Love,\" and producer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Heart on the number\none hits \"These Dreams\" and \"Alone.\" Warren wrote \"Look Away\" from the man's\nperspective and submitted a demo to Chicago's management company. \"Diane's\ndemos always sound really good,\" Nevison said. \"Her demos are always very\nsimple, but they always have great vocal performances.\" Bassist Jason Scheff\nremarked, \"The songs that last for me are the ones I don't get at first,\" and\nadded, \"I remember hearing 'Look Away' and thinking it's okay, but not great.\nThank God I'm not an A&R; man.\" Before being submitted to Chicago, the song\nwas one of two ballads offered by Epic Records to Cheap Trick, who chose \"The\nFlame\" instead. The song featured Bill Champlin on lead vocals and furthered\nChicago's shift towards de-emphasizing the band's brass section compared to\ntheir earlier years. Scheff noted that with Peter Cetera having left the group\nand \"making his own records, it was good for us to release some songs with a\ndifferent sound (like) Bill's voice. Then we wouldn't be saturating radio with\nChicago-sounding songs.\"\n\n## Reception\n\n\"Look Away\" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in September 1988\nand reached No. 1, where it spent two weeks, in December. Champlin said he was\nunaware of the feat at the time. \"Everybody said, 'I hear your song every\nday,'\" he recalled. \"I go, 'What song?' I was kind of oblivious to the whole\nthing, busy working on new stuff. That's what happens. As everybody else gets\naware of what you're doing, you're usually about five or six tunes past it.\"\nThe single was certified gold in January and ranked No. 1 on the 1989\nBillboard Year-End singles chart. It also reached No. 1 on the Adult\nContemporary chart. Outside the U.S., \"Look Away\" peaked at No. 1 in Canada,\nNo. 10 in the Netherlands, No. 15 in Sweden, and No. 20 in Belgium. A British\nman now claims he is the author of the song and has launched legal\nproceedings.\n\n## Track listing\n\n7\" Vinyl; Cassette\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n### All-time charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## References\n\n## See also\n\nList of Hot Adult Contemporary number ones of 1988\n\n## External links\n\n",

      "# Pigs in culture\n\nPigs, widespread in societies around the world since neolithic times, have\nbeen used for many purposes in art, literature, and other expressions of human\nculture. In classical times, the Romans considered pork the finest of meats,\nenjoying sausages and steaks, and depicting them in their art. Across Europe,\npigs have been celebrated in carnivals since the Middle Ages, becoming\nspecially important in Medieval Germany in cities such as Nuremberg, and in\nEarly Modern Italy in cities such as Bologna. In literature, both for children\nand adults, pig characters appear in allegories, comic stories, and serious\nnovels. In art, pigs have been represented in a wide range of media and styles\nfrom the earliest times in many cultures. Pig names are used in idioms and\nanimal epithets, often derogatory, since pigs have long been linked with\ndirtiness and greed, while places such as Swindon are named for their\nassociation with swine. The eating of pork is forbidden in Islam and Judaism,\nbut pigs are sacred in other religions.\n\n## Celebration of meat\n\n### Classical times\n\nThe scholar Michael MacKinnon writes that \"Pork was generally considered the\nchoicest of all the domestic meats consumed during Roman times, and it was\ningested in a multitude of forms, from sausages to steaks, by rich and poor\nalike. No other animal had so many Latin names (e.g. sus, porcus, porco, aper)\nor was the ingredient in so many ancient recipes as outlined in the culinary\nmanual of Apicius.\" Pigs have been found at almost every archaeological site\nin Roman Italy; they are described by Roman agricultural writers such as Cato\nand Varro, and in Pliny the Elder's Natural History. MacKinnon notes that the\nbreeds of pig can be seen on monuments such as the Arch of Constantine, which\nhe describes as a lop-eared, fat-bellied, and smooth breed.\n\n### Carnival\n\nBenton Jay Komins notes that the pig has been celebrated throughout Europe\nsince ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the Italian carne\nlevare, the lifting of meat. Komins quotes Peter Stallybrass and Allon White\non the pig's ambiguous role:\n\n### English tradition\n\nIn England, pork pies were being made in Melton Mowbray by the 1780s,\naccording to the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (founded in 1998). The\npies were originally baked in a clay pot with a pastry cover, developing to\ntheir modern form of a pastry case. Local tradition states that farm hands\ncarried these while at work; aristocratic fox hunters of the Quorn, Cottesmore\nand Belvoir hunts supposedly saw this and acquired a taste for the pies. A\nslightly later date of origin is given by the claim that pie manufacture in\nthe town began around 1831 when a local baker and confectioner, Edward Adcock,\nstarted to make pies as a sideline. Melton Mowbray pork pies were granted PGI\nstatus in 2008.\n\n### German tradition\n\nGerman cities such as Nuremberg have made pork sausages since at least 1315\nAD, when the W\u00fcrstlein (sausage controller) office was introduced. Some 1500\ntypes of sausage are produced in the country. The Nuremberg bratwurst is\nrequired to be at most 90 mm long and to weigh at most 25 grams; it is\nflavoured with mace, pepper, and marjoram. In Early Modern times starting in\n1614, Nuremberg's butchers paraded through the city each year carrying a 400\nmetre long sausage.\n\n### Italian tradition\n\nThe pig, and pork products such as mortadella were economically important in\nItalian cities such as Bologna and Modena in the Early Modern period, and\ncelebrated as such; they have remained so into modern times. In 2019, the\nIstituzione Biblioteche Bologna held an exhibition Pane e salame. Immagini\ngastronomiche bolognesi dalle raccolte dell'Archiginnasio on the gastronomic\nimages in the Bologna library's collection.\n\n## Literature\n\n### Adults\n\nPigs have been brought into literature for varying reasons, ranging from the\npleasures of eating, as in Charles Lamb's A Dissertation upon Roast Pig, to\nWilliam Golding's Lord of the Flies (with the fat character \"Piggy\"), where\nthe rotting boar's head on a stick represents Beelzebub, \"lord of the flies\"\nbeing the direct translation of the Hebrew \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d1\u05d5\u05d1, and George Orwell's\nallegorical novel Animal Farm, where the central characters, representing\nSoviet leaders, are all pigs. The pig is used to comic effect in P. G.\nWodehouse's stories set in Blandings Castle, where the eccentric Lord Emsworth\nkeeps an extremely fat prize pig called the Empress of Blandings which is\nfrequently stolen, kidnapped or otherwise threatened. Quite a different use is\nmade of the pig in Lloyd Alexander's fantasy books The Chronicles of Prydain,\nwhere Hen Wen is a pig with foresight, used to see the future and locate\nmystical items such as The Black Cauldron. One of the earliest literary\nreferences is Heraclitus, who speaks of the preference pigs have for mud over\nclean water in the Fragments. In Wu Cheng'en's 16th century Chinese novel\nJourney to the West, Zhu Bajie is part human, part pig. In books, poems and\ncartoons in 18th century England, The Learned Pig was a trained animal who\nappeared to be able to answer questions.\n\n### Children\n\nPigs have featured in children's books since at least 1840, when Three Little\nPigs appeared in print; the story has appeared in many different versions such\nas Disney's 1933 film and Roald Dahl's 1982 Revolting Rhymes. Even earlier is\nthe popular 18th century English nursery rhyme and fingerplay, \"This Little\nPiggy\", frequently in film and literature, such as the Warner Brothers\ncartoons A Tale of Two Kitties (1942) and A Hare Grows In Manhattan (1947)\nwhich use the rhyme to comic effect. Two of Beatrix Potter's \"little books\",\nThe Tale of Pigling Bland and The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, feature the\nadventures of pigs dressed as people. Several animated cartoon series have\nincluded pigs as prominent characters. One of the earliest pigs in cartoon was\nthe gluttonous \"Piggy\", who appeared in four Warner Brothers' Merrie Melodies\nshorts between 1931 and 1937, most notably Pigs Is Pigs, and was followed by\nPorky Pig, with similar habits. Piglet is Pooh's constant companion in A. A.\nMilne's Winnie the Pooh stories and the Disney films based on them, while in\nCharlotte's Web, the central character Wilbur is a pig who formed a\nrelationship with a spider named Charlotte. The 1995 film Babe humorously\nportrayed a pig who wanted to be a Herding dog, based on the character in Dick\nKing-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep Pig.\n\n## Art\n\nPigs have appeared in art in media including pottery, sculpture, metalwork,\nengravings, oil paintings, watercolour, and stained glass, from neolithic\ntimes onwards. Some have functioned as amulets.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe pig has come to be seen as unacceptable to several world religions. In\nIslam and Judaism the consumption of pork is forbidden. Many Hindus are lacto-\nvegetarian, avoiding all kinds of meat. The boar Varaha is however venerated\nas an avatar of the god Vishnu. In Buddhism, the pig symbolises delusion\n(Sanskrit: moha), one of the three poisons (Sanskrit: trivi\u1e63a). As with\nHindus, many Buddhists are vegetarian, and some sutras of the Buddha state\nthat meat should not be eaten; monks in the Mahayana traditions are forbidden\nto eat meat of any kind. Pigs have in contrast been sacred in several\nreligions, including the Druids of Ireland, whose priests were called \"swine\".\nOne of the animals sacred to the Roman goddess Diana was the boar; she sent\nthe Calydonian boar to destroy the land. Varaha as already mentioned was the\nboar-headed avatar of Vishnu. The sow was sacred to the Egyptian goddess Isis\nand used in sacrifice to Osiris.\n\n## Places\n\nThere are several places in England named for pigs, such as Grizedale (\"Pig\nvalley\", from Old Scandinavian griss, young pig, and dalr, valley), Swilland\n(\"Pig land\", from Old English swin and land), Swindon (\"Pig hill\"), and\nSwineford (\"Pig ford\"). Similar names are found in other countries; for\nexample, in Scandinavia hundreds of places have names such as Svinbergen (\"Pig\nhill\"), Svindal (\"Pig valley\"), Svingrund (\"Pig ground\"), Svinhagen (\"Pig\nhedge\"), Svink\u00e4rr (\"Pig marsh\"), Svinvik (\"Pig bay\"), Svinholm (\"Pig islet\"),\nSvinsk\u00e4r (\"Pig skerry\"), Svintorget (\"Pig market\"), and Svin\u00f6 (\"Pig island\").\n\n## Idiom\n\nSeveral idioms related to pigs have entered the English language, often with\nnegative connotations of dirt, greed, or the monopolisation of resources, as\nin \"road hog\" or \"server hog\". As the scholar Richard Horwitz puts it, people\nall over the world have made pigs stand for \"extremes of human joy or fear,\ncelebration, ridicule, and repulsion\". Pig names are used as epithets for\nnegative human attributes, especially greed, gluttony, and uncleanliness, and\nthese ascribed attributes have often led to critical comparisons between pigs\nand humans. \"Pig\" is used as a slang term for either a police officer or a\nmale chauvinist, the latter term adopted originally by the women's liberation\nmovement in the 1960s.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of fictional pigs\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Pigs in culture\n\nPigs, widespread in societies around the world since neolithic times, have\nbeen used for many purposes in art, literature, and other expressions of human\nculture. In classical times, the Romans considered pork the finest of meats,\nenjoying sausages and steaks, and depicting them in their art. Across Europe,\npigs have been celebrated in carnivals since the Middle Ages, becoming\nspecially important in Medieval Germany in cities such as Nuremberg, and in\nEarly Modern Italy in cities such as Bologna. In literature, both for children\nand adults, pig characters appear in allegories, comic stories, and serious\nnovels. In art, pigs have been represented in a wide range of media and styles\nfrom the earliest times in many cultures. Pig names are used in idioms and\nanimal epithets, often derogatory, since pigs have long been linked with\ndirtiness and greed, while places such as Swindon are named for their\nassociation with swine. The eating of pork is forbidden in Islam and Judaism,\nbut pigs are sacred in other religions.\n\n## Celebration of meat\n\n### Classical times\n\nThe scholar Michael MacKinnon writes that \"Pork was generally considered the\nchoicest of all the domestic meats consumed during Roman times, and it was\ningested in a multitude of forms, from sausages to steaks, by rich and poor\nalike. No other animal had so many Latin names (e.g. sus, porcus, porco, aper)\nor was the ingredient in so many ancient recipes as outlined in the culinary\nmanual of Apicius.\" Pigs have been found at almost every archaeological site\nin Roman Italy; they are described by Roman agricultural writers such as Cato\nand Varro, and in Pliny the Elder's Natural History. MacKinnon notes that the\nbreeds of pig can be seen on monuments such as the Arch of Constantine, which\nhe describes as a lop-eared, fat-bellied, and smooth breed.\n\n### Carnival\n\nBenton Jay Komins notes that the pig has been celebrated throughout Europe\nsince ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the Italian carne\nlevare, the lifting of meat. Komins quotes Peter Stallybrass and Allon White\non the pig's ambiguous role:\n\n### English tradition\n\nIn England, pork pies were being made in Melton Mowbray by the 1780s,\naccording to the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (founded in 1998). The\npies were originally baked in a clay pot with a pastry cover, developing to\ntheir modern form of a pastry case. Local tradition states that farm hands\ncarried these while at work; aristocratic fox hunters of the Quorn, Cottesmore\nand Belvoir hunts supposedly saw this and acquired a taste for the pies. A\nslightly later date of origin is given by the claim that pie manufacture in\nthe town began around 1831 when a local baker and confectioner, Edward Adcock,\nstarted to make pies as a sideline. Melton Mowbray pork pies were granted PGI\nstatus in 2008.\n\n### German tradition\n\nGerman cities such as Nuremberg have made pork sausages since at least 1315\nAD, when the W\u00fcrstlein (sausage controller) office was introduced. Some 1500\ntypes of sausage are produced in the country. The Nuremberg bratwurst is\nrequired to be at most 90 mm long and to weigh at most 25 grams; it is\nflavoured with mace, pepper, and marjoram. In Early Modern times starting in\n1614, Nuremberg's butchers paraded through the city each year carrying a 400\nmetre long sausage.\n\n### Italian tradition\n\nThe pig, and pork products such as mortadella were economically important in\nItalian cities such as Bologna and Modena in the Early Modern period, and\ncelebrated as such; they have remained so into modern times. In 2019, the\nIstituzione Biblioteche Bologna held an exhibition Pane e salame. Immagini\ngastronomiche bolognesi dalle raccolte dell'Archiginnasio on the gastronomic\nimages in the Bologna library's collection.\n\n## Literature\n\n### Adults\n\nPigs have been brought into literature for varying reasons, ranging from the\npleasures of eating, as in Charles Lamb's A Dissertation upon Roast Pig, to\nWilliam Golding's Lord of the Flies (with the fat character \"Piggy\"), where\nthe rotting boar's head on a stick represents Beelzebub, \"lord of the flies\"\nbeing the direct translation of the Hebrew \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d1\u05d5\u05d1, and George Orwell's\nallegorical novel Animal Farm, where the central characters, representing\nSoviet leaders, are all pigs. The pig is used to comic effect in P. G.\nWodehouse's stories set in Blandings Castle, where the eccentric Lord Emsworth\nkeeps an extremely fat prize pig called the Empress of Blandings which is\nfrequently stolen, kidnapped or otherwise threatened. Quite a different use is\nmade of the pig in Lloyd Alexander's fantasy books The Chronicles of Prydain,\nwhere Hen Wen is a pig with foresight, used to see the future and locate\nmystical items such as The Black Cauldron. One of the earliest literary\nreferences is Heraclitus, who speaks of the preference pigs have for mud over\nclean water in the Fragments. In Wu Cheng'en's 16th century Chinese novel\nJourney to the West, Zhu Bajie is part human, part pig. In books, poems and\ncartoons in 18th century England, The Learned Pig was a trained animal who\nappeared to be able to answer questions.\n\n### Children\n\nPigs have featured in children's books since at least 1840, when Three Little\nPigs appeared in print; the story has appeared in many different versions such\nas Disney's 1933 film and Roald Dahl's 1982 Revolting Rhymes. Even earlier is\nthe popular 18th century English nursery rhyme and fingerplay, \"This Little\nPiggy\", frequently in film and literature, such as the Warner Brothers\ncartoons A Tale of Two Kitties (1942) and A Hare Grows In Manhattan (1947)\nwhich use the rhyme to comic effect. Two of Beatrix Potter's \"little books\",\nThe Tale of Pigling Bland and The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, feature the\nadventures of pigs dressed as people. Several animated cartoon series have\nincluded pigs as prominent characters. One of the earliest pigs in cartoon was\nthe gluttonous \"Piggy\", who appeared in four Warner Brothers' Merrie Melodies\nshorts between 1931 and 1937, most notably Pigs Is Pigs, and was followed by\nPorky Pig, with similar habits. Piglet is Pooh's constant companion in A. A.\nMilne's Winnie the Pooh stories and the Disney films based on them, while in\nCharlotte's Web, the central character Wilbur is a pig who formed a\nrelationship with a spider named Charlotte. The 1995 film Babe humorously\nportrayed a pig who wanted to be a Herding dog, based on the character in Dick\nKing-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep Pig.\n\n## Art\n\nPigs have appeared in art in media including pottery, sculpture, metalwork,\nengravings, oil paintings, watercolour, and stained glass, from neolithic\ntimes onwards. Some have functioned as amulets.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe pig has come to be seen as unacceptable to several world religions. In\nIslam and Judaism the consumption of pork is forbidden. Many Hindus are lacto-\nvegetarian, avoiding all kinds of meat. The boar Varaha is however venerated\nas an avatar of the god Vishnu. In Buddhism, the pig symbolises delusion\n(Sanskrit: moha), one of the three poisons (Sanskrit: trivi\u1e63a). As with\nHindus, many Buddhists are vegetarian, and some sutras of the Buddha state\nthat meat should not be eaten; monks in the Mahayana traditions are forbidden\nto eat meat of any kind. Pigs have in contrast been sacred in several\nreligions, including the Druids of Ireland, whose priests were called \"swine\".\nOne of the animals sacred to the Roman goddess Diana was the boar; she sent\nthe Calydonian boar to destroy the land. Varaha as already mentioned was the\nboar-headed avatar of Vishnu. The sow was sacred to the Egyptian goddess Isis\nand used in sacrifice to Osiris.\n\n## Places\n\nThere are several places in England named for pigs, such as Grizedale (\"Pig\nvalley\", from Old Scandinavian griss, young pig, and dalr, valley), Swilland\n(\"Pig land\", from Old English swin and land), Swindon (\"Pig hill\"), and\nSwineford (\"Pig ford\"). Similar names are found in other countries; for\nexample, in Scandinavia hundreds of places have names such as Svinbergen (\"Pig\nhill\"), Svindal (\"Pig valley\"), Svingrund (\"Pig ground\"), Svinhagen (\"Pig\nhedge\"), Svink\u00e4rr (\"Pig marsh\"), Svinvik (\"Pig bay\"), Svinholm (\"Pig islet\"),\nSvinsk\u00e4r (\"Pig skerry\"), Svintorget (\"Pig market\"), and Svin\u00f6 (\"Pig island\").\n\n## Idiom\n\nSeveral idioms related to pigs have entered the English language, often with\nnegative connotations of dirt, greed, or the monopolisation of resources, as\nin \"road hog\" or \"server hog\". As the scholar Richard Horwitz puts it, people\nall over the world have made pigs stand for \"extremes of human joy or fear,\ncelebration, ridicule, and repulsion\". Pig names are used as epithets for\nnegative human attributes, especially greed, gluttony, and uncleanliness, and\nthese ascribed attributes have often led to critical comparisons between pigs\nand humans. \"Pig\" is used as a slang term for either a police officer or a\nmale chauvinist, the latter term adopted originally by the women's liberation\nmovement in the 1960s.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of fictional pigs\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n## External links\n\n"

The procedure is for the sample to be suspended in ethanol,\nallowing lipids present to dissolve (lipids are soluble in alcohols). The\nliquid (alcohol with dissolved fat) is then decanted into water. Since lipids\ndo not dissolve in water, when the ethanol is diluted, it falls out of the\nsolution to give a cloudy white emulsion.\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Lipid profile\n\nLipid profile or lipid panel is a panel of blood tests that serves as an\ninitial screening tool for abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and\ntriglycerides. The results of this test can identify certain genetic diseases\nand can determine approximate risks for cardiovascular disease, certain forms\nof pancreatitis, and other diseases. Lipid panels are ordered as part of a\nphysical exam, along with other panels such as the complete blood count (CBC)\nand basic metabolic panel (BMP)\n\n## Components\n\nThe lipid profile typically includes:\n\n  * Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\n  * High-density lipoprotein (HDL)\n  * Triglycerides\n  * Total cholesterol\n\nUsing these values, a laboratory may also calculate:\n\n  * Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)\n  * Cholesterol:HDL ratio\n\nThe lipid profile tests are of 7 types:\n\n  * Total lipids\n  * Serum total cholesterol\n  * serum HDL cholesterol\n  * Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio\n  * Serum triglycerides\n  * Serum Phospholipids\n  * Electrophoretic fractionation to determination percentage of\n    * (a) Chylomicrons\n    * (b) LDL\n    * (c) VLDL\n    * (d) HDL\n\n## Procedure and indication\n\nCurrent recommendations for cholesterol testing come from the Adult Treatment\nPanel (ATP) III guidelines, and are based on many large clinical studies, such\nas the Framingham Heart Study. For healthy adults with no cardiovascular risk\nfactors, the ATP III guidelines recommend screening once every five years. A\nlipid profile may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success\nof lipid-lowering drugs such as statins. In the pediatric and adolescent\npopulation, lipid testing is not routinely performed. However, the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics and NHLBI now recommend that children aged 9\u201311 be\nscreened once for severe cholesterol abnormalities. This screening can be\nvaluable to detect genetic diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia that\ncan be lethal if not treated early. Traditionally, most laboratories have\nrequired patients to fast for 9\u201312 hours before screening. However, recent\nstudies have questioned the utility of fasting before lipid panels, and some\ndiagnostic labs now routinely accept non-fasting samples. Typically the\nlaboratory measures only three quantities: total cholesterol; HDL;\nTriglycerides. From these three data LDL may be calculated. According to\nFriedewald's equation:\n\n  * LDL = Total cholesterol - HDL - Triglycerides/5\n\nOther calculations of LDL from those same three data have been proposed which\nyield some significantly different results. VLDL may be defined as the total\ncholesterol that is neither HDL nor LDL. Then Friedewald's equation mentioned\nabove yields:\n\n  * VLDL = Triglycerides/5\n\nThe alternative calculations mentioned above may yield significantly different\nvalues for VLDL.\n\n## Implications\n\nThis test is used to identify dyslipidemia (various disturbances of\ncholesterol and triglyceride levels), many forms of which are recognized risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease and rarely pancreatitis. A total\ncholesterol reading can be used to assess an individual's risk for heart\ndisease, however, it should not be relied upon as the only indicator. The\nindividual components that make up total cholesterol reading\u2014LDL, HDL, and\nVLDL\u2014are also important in measuring risk. For instance, someone's total\ncholesterol may be high, but this may be due to very high HDL (\"good\ncholesterol\") cholesterol levels,\u2014which can actually help prevent heart\ndisease (the test is mainly concerned with high LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\"\nlevels). So, while a high total cholesterol level may help give an indication\nthat there is a problem with cholesterol levels, the components that make up\ntotal cholesterol should also be measured.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Vertical auto profile\n\nThe vertical auto profile (VAP) test is a cholesterol, lipid and lipoprotein\ntest.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe name \"VAP test\" uses a technology, the vertical auto profile, to measure\nand report risk factors for patients who are at increased risk for\ncardiovascular disease that are not captured by routine cholesterol testing.\nIts accuracy is unaffected by triglycerides and can be performed in a non-\nfasting state. The VAP test has a unique ability to identify far more areas of\nrisk to patients than the standard lipid panel, specifically because it\nreports 15 separate components versus four in the standard cholesterol test.\nStudies report that this comprehensive test is able to identify more than\ntwice the number of patients with lipid abnormalities than the standard lipid\npanel (cholesterol and triglyceride test). The VAP test directly measures and\nroutinely reports all five lipoprotein classes and sub-classes, including LDL,\nHDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), very low density lipoprotein\n(VLDL), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. The VAP technology also measures and\nreports LDL particle concentration (LDL-P). The test meets the American\nDiabetes Association and American College of Cardiology (ADA-ACC) cholesterol\nguidelines for people at high risk of heart attack and stroke (including\npeople with Type 2 diabetes mellitus). The ADA-ACC consensus statement\nestablishes measurement and treatment guidelines for Apolipoprotein B|apoB in\naddition to LDL and non-HDL in high-risk patients. The VAP test was the first\ncholesterol profile to comply with updated National Cholesterol Education\nProgram ATP III recommendations for LDL measurement. The VAP technology is\ncurrently owned and operated by VAP Diagnostics Lab, an international company.\nSummary of Studies: \u2022 In a Johns Hopkins study of 1.34 million patients, up to\n60% of patients assessed were misclassified using the Friedewald estimated\nbasic lipid panel, potentially leading to undertreatment of those patients\nmost at risk.1 \u2022 Fasting remnant lipoprotein cholesterol is independently\nassociated with sublicinical atherosclerosis: The ELSA-BRASIL Study.2 \u2022\nSmaller, denser HDL3-C levels are primarily responsible for the inverse\nassociation between HDL-C and incident CHD in this diverse group of primary\nprevention subjects: Jackson Heart Study & Framingham Offspring Cohort Study.3\n\u2022 Remnant Lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C) levels are an independent predictor\nof the incidents of CHD in two primary prevention cohorts: Jackson Heart Study\n& Framingham Offspring Cohort Study.4 \u2022 Low HDL3-C, but not HDL2-C or HDL-C,\nindependently increased the risk for long-term hard clinical events in\nsecondary prevention patients: TRIUMPH.5 \u2022 The apo A1 remnant ratio was a\nsignificant predictor of short and intermediate-term death/myocardial\ninfarction risk among women over 50.6\n\n## References\n\n1\\.

      "# Beauty and the Beast (1987 film)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (alternatively: Cannon Movie Tales: Beauty and the Beast\nin United States, Die Sch\u00f6ne und das Biest in West Germany, La Bella e la\nBestia in Italy, La Belle et la B\u00eate in France) is a 1987 American/Israeli\nmusical film, part of the 1980 film series Cannon Movie Tales. It is a\ncontemporary version of the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. The movie\nwas filmed entirely in Israel, and the taglines were: \"The monster they feared\nwas the prince she loved\" and \"The classic fairy tale about seeing with your\nheart\".\n\n## Plot\n\nA wealthy merchant lives an affluent life with his two sons, Oliver and\nFrederick, and three daughters, Bettina, Isabella and Beauty. Beauty, the\nyoungest daughter, is the caretaker of her family; without her, none of the\nfamily can look after themselves, and she is constantly taking care of her\nsiblings. Despite this, Beauty is not frustrated, but she wonders what she\nwould do with her life if she did not devote it to her family. After the\nmerchant loses his wealth in a storm at sea, the family must renounce their\nluxurious life and move to the countryside, with Beauty once again taking\ncharge. After a time, the family hear that their wealth may be returned, for a\nship has made it to port. To celebrate, the father promises his children gifts\nof luxury, but Beauty merely wants a rose. The merchant realises it was a lost\ncause, for he is still as poor as he was when he left, and returns. He stops\noff at a beautiful castle where an unseen host treats him to good food and a\nwarm bed. However, the old man plucks a rose from the garden, and the host\ndemands that as punishment, Beauty must come to live with him. Beauty moves to\nthe castle, and is alone for the first time in her life. Therefore, she\nrealises what she wants to do with her life, and realises that the Beast (the\nformerly unseen host) is not a complete monster. When Beauty's father takes\nher to the castle, the Beast gives him two chests of gold and horses to carry\nit, as compensation for giving up his daughter. It seems that while in the\ncastle anything she wants magically appears. The Beast has magical powers and\ngrants all her wishes. The only time they see each other is at diner. He holds\na rose and each night asks, \"Do you love me? Will you marry me?\". She always\nreplies \"No.\" Every night she dreams of a prince whom she loves (despite it\nbeing only a dream). She is shocked when she finds paintings of this dream\nprince in Beast's castle. Over time she is happy at the castle, but asks the\nBeast if she can visit her family, for she misses them. He allows her and says\n\"Be back in one month, or I will die.\" Also time flows differently. In the\ncastle it has been about a week, but to the outside world it has been a year.\nWhile with her family they learn how to care for themselves instead of Beauty\nhaving to take care of them. She thinks about Beast and has to return, against\nher family's urging her to stay. Upon returning to the castle she finds Beast\ndying for her lateness. She cries and mourns, begging Beast not to die. That's\nwhen she realizes how much she cares for him.

      "# Black Eyed, Please\n\n\"Black Eyed, Please\" is the fifteenth episode of the 24th season of The\nSimpsons, and the 523rd episode overall. It first aired on the Fox network in\nthe United States on March 10, 2013. The name is a pun on black-eyed peas and\nthe band, The Black Eyed Peas. The couch segment of this episode's intro was\nanimated by Bill Plympton in a film noir style. He also animated one for 2012\nand one for 2014.\n\n## Plot\n\nHomer invites himself to Ned Flanders's house for breakfast and finds Ned's\nbeatnik parents there. Ned begins to feel uneasy when his parents begin to\ntake a liking to Homer rather than him. After a morning jog, Ned comes home to\nfind Homer and his parents smoking \"medicinal\" marijuana and watching TV. Ned\nbecomes so enraged he punches Homer in the face, giving him a black eye. Homer\nis furious at Ned, who does not know what he has to do in order to be excused.\nNed eventually finds a solution in the Bible (\"an eye for an eye\"), and\nencourages Homer to punch him in order to make them even. However, Homer\nrefuses to punch him, citing that he is the bigger man by not punching Ned and\nbrags about it, causing Ned to punch Homer's other uninjured eye. Meanwhile,\nLisa learns that Ms. Hoover has taken leave due to a bout of severe\ndepression, and the class gets another teacher, Mrs. Cantwell. Cantwell takes\na liking to everyone in the class except for Lisa, whom she bullies by giving\nher lower grades and taking the paper cutout joeys off the kangaroo-themed\n\"good behavior\" board. Homer and Marge try to get Principal Skinner to do\nsomething, but the bullying worsens and Lisa is sent to detention, where the\nbullies are shocked to learn that Cantwell as a teacher is such a bully to a\nstudent like Lisa. Homer eventually finds a solution to Lisa's dilemma and\nNed's own: he will accept Ned's apology if his wife Edna Krabappel gives\nadvice on how to get rid of the bullying teacher. Edna says the only way is\nthe \"nuclear option\" - which means putting Bart in Cantwell's class. When\nCantwell leaves to go to the bathroom, Bart brings chaos to the classroom and\nthen shows Cantwell a compromising video of herself in the bathroom cursing\nLisa and tells her he posted it online. The plan works in getting Cantwell to\nleave, but it does not get Cantwell to be nice to Lisa. When Lisa tries to\ncatch up to Cantwell before she drives off, Cantwell admits that she was only\njealous because Lisa is pretty, and that pretty girls like Lisa have it easier\nthan girls like Cantwell, who have to use their brains to get by in life. This\nis an idea that Lisa happily accepts \u2014 even after Cantwell splatters mud on\nher as she drives off. The story ends with Homer having a barbecue with Ned\nand his parents, and Ned's father revealing to Marge that he got Homer and Ned\nto be nice to each other by slipping marijuana in their food.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nRobert David Sullivan of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying that\nalthough the stories were \"not bad\", the script was filled out with \"an\nunforgivable number of hacky jokes.\" Rob H. Dawson of TV Equals praised the\n\"long, absurd riff on sports announcers\" and wished that its silly tone could\nhave been present throughout the episode.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe episode received a 2.2 in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total\nof 4.85 million viewers. This made it the second most-watched show on Fox's\nAnimation Domination line up that night, beating American Dad!, The Cleveland\nShow and Bob's Burgers but losing out to Family Guy with 5.27 million.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Black Eyed, Please\" at theSimpsons.com\n\n"

      "# Love, Me\n\n\"Love, Me\" is a song written by Skip Ewing and Max T. Barnes, and recorded by\nAmerican country music artist Collin Raye.

It tells of a couple who\npromise to love each other. The song's narrator tells of being with his\ngrandfather, and reading a note that was written by his late grandmother back\nwhen both grandparents were younger. The grandfather explains that he had\nintended to meet her at a certain tree: \"If you get there before I do, don't\ngive up on me / I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how\nlong I'll be / But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see / And\nbetween now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you / Love, me.\" In\nthe second verse, the narrator and his grandfather are at a church where they\nstopped to pray just before the late grandmother died, and the grandfather\nreads the note and begins to cry, that is the first time that he ever saw his\ngrandfather crying.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video was directed by Peter Lippman and premiered in late 1991.\n\n## Chart positions\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",

    "question": "Who is the mayor of Warner Robins, GA in 2014?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Warner Robins, Georgia\n\nWarner Robins (typically ) is a city in the U.S. state of Georgia, located in\nHouston and Peach counties in the central part of the state. It is currently\nGeorgia's tenth-largest incorporated city, with an estimated population of\n75,797 in 2018. The city is the main component of the Warner Robins\nMetropolitan Statistical Area, including the entirety of Houston, Peach, and\nPulaski counties, which had an estimated population of 193,835 in 2018; it, in\nturn, is a component of a larger trade area, the Macon-Warner Robins-Fort\nValley Combined Statistical Area, with an estimated 2018 population of\n423,572. Robins Air Force Base, a major U.S. Air Force maintenance and\nlogistics complex founded as Warner Robins Air Depot in 1942, is located just\neast of the city limits; the base's expansion and the suburbanization of\nnearby Macon have led to the city's rapid growth in the post-World War II era.\n\n## History\n\nWarner Robins was founded in 1942 when the small farming community of Wellston\nwas renamed for General Augustine Warner Robins (1882-1940) of the United\nStates Army Air Corps, which later became the United States Air Force. It was\nincorporated as a town in 1943 and as a city in 1956. The 1940 census shows\nthat the community of Wellston was sparsely populated and inhabited primarily\nby farmers and their families. Its most notable landmark was a stop on the\nrailroad line. Wellston also had a small sawmill and a grocery store. Peach\norchards covered parts of the surrounding land. World War II soon changed\nthis. The War Department made plans to build an air depot in the Southeast.\nWith the assistance of influential U.S. Representative Carl Vinson, Wellston\ncommunity leader Charles Bostic \"Boss\" Watson worked with officials in Macon\nto make a bid to locate this air depot in Houston County. In June 1941, the\nU.S. government accepted this offer, which included of land. This air force\nbase was initially called Wellston Army Air Depot when it opened in 1942. The\nfirst commander was Colonel Charles E. Thomas. He wanted to name this depot in\nhonor of his mentor Augustine Warner Robins, who was called by his middle\nname, Warner. Regulations prevented him from doing this, which required the\nbase to be named after the nearest town. Not deterred by this, Colonel Thomas\npersuaded Boss Watson and the other community leaders to rename the town of\nWellston. So on September 1, 1942, the town was given the new name of Warner\nRobins. Soon thereafter, on October 14, 1942, the base was renamed to become\nWarner Robins Army Air Depot.

No candidate won a majority of the vote,\nso the top two finishers, incumbent Mayor Bill Foster and former State\nRepresentative Rick Kriseman, advanced to a runoff. After a campaign described\nas \"nasty\", \"partisan\", \"contentious\" and \"the costliest in [St. Petersburg]\nhistory\", Foster lost to Kriseman by 56% to 44%, becoming the first incumbent\nmayor of St. Petersburg to lose a race for re-election in more than 26 years.\nAdam C. Smith of the Tampa Bay Times wrote that although 70% of voters\napproved of where the city was heading and Foster was \"a good man who presided\nover no corruption scandal, no violent racial unrest\", he only proved to be\n\"adequate\" at the job.

In June 2017, activist Theresa Lassiter announced her bid for\nmayoral office.\n\n#### Polling\n\n## Primary campaigns\n\nSeven candidates ended up filing for the mayoral office before the cut-off\ndate on June 23. The front-runners include the incumbent mayor Kriseman and\nformer mayor Baker, with minor candidates including Nevel, Lassiter, Cates,\nCongemi, and Barnwell. At the start of each campaign, Kriseman focused on the\ncontinuation of progress which included financing and construction of a new\npolice headquarters and St. Petersburg Pier, poverty, and keeping the Tampa\nBay Rays in the city. Baker aimed to win voters with his past management\nreputation, rebuilding the Sundial, and the Major League Soccer bid for the\nTampa Bay Rowdies. Minor candidates such as Nevel and Lassiter vowed to focus\non poverty and on St. Petersburg's southern historical black community. Upon\nannouncement of his re-election bid, Kriseman received endorsements from\ncongressman Charlie Crist, U.S. senator Bill Nelson, the Sun Coast Police\nBenevolent Association, and four city council members in March. On June 27,\nKriseman and Baker participated in a debate which centered on local issues and\nquestions as well as past campaigns.

Baker, a former two-\nterm mayor, won 27,253 or 48.23 percent. Kriseman's win in the actual primary\nvote was unexpected, since opinions polls conducted before the election showed\nBaker with not only a wide lead, but enough potential to win over enough\nvoters needed to cross the more than 50 percent majority threshold; at his\npost-election party, Baker had also given a speech claiming prematurely that\nhe had won the primary as well.\n\n## General election\n\nAt the beginning of the general election on September 6, both Kriseman and\nBaker temporarily suspended their campaigns to prepare for Hurricane Irma.\n\n## References\n\n",

Phil (Ty Burrell) closes the last room of a nearby hotel with only\none single full-sized bed. Claire (Julie Bowen) figures that they can survive\none night, but five nights later things does not seem really good.

Haley\nand Alex (Ariel Winter) find out that the hotel was half-full the whole week\nand they realize that Phil lied to them so they could all spend time together.\nThe family relents and heads down to the pool to play Marco Polo with him in\nthe middle of the night, which makes Phil very happy, but Claire dislikes how\nPhil unintentionally invited the Nigerian family to sleep at their house.\nCameron's (Eric Stonestreet) football team is up to 5-0. It is unprecedented\nat the school, so Cameron picks up several superstitions before every game.\nMitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) gets a bit tired of it and tries to stop\nCameron of following those superstitions but with no luck. When Cameron\nleaves, Mitchell realizes that it does not matter if he does not like football\nand he has to be supportive to Cameron, so he leaves to go to the game. At the\nfootball game, the team plays well and is winning, but the moment Mitchell\narrives, the luck of the team suddenly changes, something that makes Cameron\nthink that Mitchell is a jinx. He tells Mitchell causing him to leave. When\nthe team wins, Cameron is upset with himself when he realizes that Mitchell\nhas gone and he calls to apologize for what he said.

Club gave the episode a grade of\nB- saying: \"\"Marco Polo\" features a few light twists, making it one of the\nseason's fleeter installments, and yet somehow there's still a pervasive\nfeeling of been-here-done-that weighing it down despite its charms.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Marco Polo\" at ABC.com\n\n",
      "# Middle income trap\n\nThe middle income trap is a theoretical economic development situation in\nwhich a country that attains a certain income (due to given advantages) gets\nstuck at that level. The World Bank defines as the 'middle-income range'\ncountries with gross national product per capita that has remained between\n$1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nAccording to the idea, a country in the middle income trap has lost its\ncompetitive edge in the export of manufactured goods because of rising wages.\nHowever, it is unable to keep up with more developed economies in the high-\nvalue-added market. As a result, newly industrialised economies such as South\nAfrica and Brazil have not, for decades, left what the World Bank defines as\nthe 'middle-income range' since their per capita gross national product has\nremained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices. They suffer from\nlow investment, slow growth in the secondary industry, limited industrial\ndiversification and poor labor market conditions.\n\n## Avoidance\n\nAvoiding the middle income trap entails identifying strategies to introduce\nnew processes and find new markets to maintain export growth. Ramping up\ndomestic demand is also important\u2014an expanding middle class can use its\nincreasing purchasing power to buy high-quality, innovative products and help\ndrive growth. The biggest challenge is moving from resource-driven growth that\nis dependent on cheap labor and capital to growth based on high productivity\nand innovation. This requires investments in infrastructure and\neducation\u2014building a high-quality education system that encourages creativity\nand supports breakthroughs in science and technology that can be applied back\ninto the economy.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Dual-sector model\n  * Human capital\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n  * Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century\n  * Indonesia Risks Falling into the Middle Income Trap\n  * Philippines Faces Middle Income Trap\n  * Russians are stuck in 'Middle Income Trap'\n  * Latin America's Middle Income Trap\n  * How China can avoid the middle income trap\n  * \"The Middle-Income Trap.

      "# Foyle's War (series 8)\n\nSeries 8 of the ITV programme Foyle's War, comprising three episodes, aired in\nJanuary 2015 on ITV.\n\n## Episodes\n\n### \"High Castle\"\n\n#### Cast and characters\n\n#### Background and production\n\nThe story takes place shortly after the Nuremberg trials, which ended on 1\nOctober 1946. Foyle tours Monowitz concentration camp as part of his\ninvestigation of the murders of Professor Knowles and Hermann Linz. Linz was\non trial because his firm, IG Farben, had during WWII hired Monowitz\nconcentration camp inmates from the SS. Clayton Del Mar who with his father\nowns Global American Oil, portrays a war profiteer who, like Linz, should have\nbeen tried during the Nuremberg trials. However, MI5 had a history of looking\nthe other way and of protecting Del Mar because the government desired his\ninfluence to help the UK build a presence with the Shah of Iran and\nultimately, a countervailing presence to Soviet Union in the Middle East. Adam\nis forced, on two fronts, to address the issue of women who went to work\nduring wartime and do not want to give up their jobs postwar. One of his\nconstituents does not want to be demoted to accommodate a returning soldier\nwhose job she had filled, competently, in the soldiers' absence. Meanwhile, at\nhome, Sam and Adam struggle over his desire for her to quit her job to become\na stay-at-home mother.\n\n### \"Trespass\"\n\n#### Cast and characters\n\n#### Background and production\n\nIt is said in the episode to be four months since the King David Hotel bombing\nin Jerusalem, which took place on 22 July 1946. The episode opens with\nnewsreel coverage of the bombing as a prelude to violent actions by both\nJewish terrorists and anti-Semitic agitators in London. References are made\nand graffiti depicted symbolizing Perish Judah (\"PJ\"), and a \"Right Club\" type\nof organization which rallies Londoners to riot in Adam Wainwright's district.\n\n### \"Elise\"\n\n#### Cast and characters\n\n#### Background and production\n\nAccording to letters found in Hilda's apartment, the story takes place a few\ndays after 3 January 1947. An example of actual events which influenced this\nepisode is Operation NordPol, a successful German intelligence operation in\nHolland in 1942 and 1943. Its success was largely due to mistakes by the SOE\nDutch Section in London. For 20 months, the London Secret Service radio links\nwith their agents and the resistance movement in Holland were under German\ncontrol, with a loss of Allied Secret Service and Air Force men. At least 50\nagents were parachuted into the Netherlands to be met by a friendly 'welcoming\ncommittee' arranged by the German military counter-espionage chief H. J.\nGiskes. Following a debriefing, they were executed. At least 50 agents were\nsent to their death in this way. In order to maximize London's confidence and\ntrust, the Germans under Giskes managed escape passages to England for many\nunwitting captured air crew. Though previous episodes were broadcast at 8:00\npm on ITV, this final one was transmitted at 9pm.\n\n## International broadcast\n\nIt will broadcast in the United States as Foyle's War VIII, on PBS'\nMasterpiece and on Acorn TV.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Series 8 on IMDb\n\n"

      "# Shot heard round the world\n\n\"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase that refers to the opening shot\nof the Battle of Concord in 1775, which began the American Revolutionary War\nand led to the creation of the United States of America. The phrase has\nsubsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.\n\n## Skirmish at the North Bridge\n\nThe phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord\nHymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the\nOld North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers\nfell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically,\nno single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots\nwere fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans\nwere killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that\nevent are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the\nfirst shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by\nAmericans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat. The\ntowns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the\nRevolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns.\nHe was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \"birthplace of\nAmerican liberty\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \"first\nforcible resistance\" was made there. President Ulysses S. Grant considered not\nattending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In\n1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as\n\"Lexington Day\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday\nis Patriots' Day. Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time\nwhen he was composing the \"Concord Hymn\", from which his grandfather and\nfather (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located\napproximately from the North Bridge.\n\n## Assassination of Franz Ferdinand\n\nThe phrase \"shot heard round the world\" (alternatively \"shots heard round the\nworld\" or \"shot heard around the world\") has also become associated with the\nassassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June\n1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I.\nSerbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's\nwife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke\nhimself. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,\npropelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.\n\n## Widespread idiomatic use\n\nThe phrase \"Shot heard round the world\" continues to be a stock phrase in the\n21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general. The\nphrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history. In\nbaseball, the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" refers to the game-winning walk-\noff home run by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers\npitcher Ralph Branca to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951.\nThe Giants won the game 5\u20134 as a result of the home run, defeating their\ntraditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually\nlost the World Series to the Yankees. In association football, the shot heard\nround the world refers to Paul Caligiuri's winning goal for the United States\nmen's national soccer team in the final qualifying round for the 1990 FIFA\nWorld Cup on 19 November 1989. The US had not qualified for the World Cup\nsince 1950. The team was in third position of the CONCACAF playoffs before\ntheir final game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The US had to\nwin to go to the finals, their opponents only needed a draw. Defensive\nmidfielder Caliguri, the only full-professional player in the team, received\nthe ball 40 yards out from goal, and instead of passing it to a striker, beat\none defender and launched a 30-yard shot that looped into goal.\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Shot heard round the world (soccer)\n\nThe \"Shot heard round the world\" is a term used in reference to one of the\nmost historic goals in U.S. soccer history, which allowed the U.S. national\nteam to make it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup after 36 years of failed attempts\nto qualify. This goal was scored in the qualification game between United\nStates and Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989 in Port of Spain. The U.S.\nteam had not qualified for a FIFA World Cup since 1950, and the U.S. (having\nbeing selected by FIFA in 1988 to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup) wanted to give\na good impression to the world of soccer by qualifying to the 1990 World Cup.\n\n## Background\n\nThe United States was one of the five nations competing in the final round of\nCONCACAF's qualifiers for two spots at the upcoming World Cup in Italy, the\nother involved nations being Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Trinidad &\nTobago. Mexico was disqualified due to a scandal related with the age\nadulteration for a youth tournament, known as los cachirules. In that time,\nthe U.S. team was formed mainly by college and semi-professional players. They\nstarted by losing 1\u20130 to Costa Rica, then they got revenge by beating Costa\nRica 1\u20130, tied 1\u20131 against Trinidad and Tobago, won 2\u20131 against Guatemala and\nwon 1\u20130 against El Salvador. After scoreless draws against both Guatemala and\nEl Salvador, the situation of the group was as follows: The United States\nneeded a win in order to qualify for the World Cup because a loss or a draw\nwould allow Trinidad and Tobago to qualify. Costa Rica had already\nmathematically qualified for the tournament in Italy.\n\n## Match\n\nThe game was played on November 19, 1989 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium in\nPort of Spain. The stadium was painted red, as an homage to the Strike Squad\nas the Trinidad and Tobago team was then known as. In the first minutes, John\nHarkes tried unsuccessfully to score. Trinidad and Tobago's Elliot Allen had\ntwo attempts on goal. At the 30th minute, Bruce Murray passed the ball to Paul\nCaligiuri, who dodged a rival defender and with a left-footed shot scored 1\u20130\nfor the United States. Trinidadian goalkeeper Michael Maurice waited for the\nball practically standing on the goal-line, but he couldn't see it, arguing\nthat the sun had blinded him. In the second half, the Trinidadian team went\ninto attack in order to get a draw, but their efforts were in vain, as\nAmerican goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to stop Trinidad and Tobago's\nattempts. After the final whistle, the U.S. celebrated the victory while\nTrinidad and Tobago was left in consternation.\n\n### Details\n\n## Post-match\n\nAfter game, the group results were as follows: Due to the political situation\nin El Salvador and the fact that El Salvador and Guatemala had no chances to\nqualify for the World Cup, the matches still to be played between El Salvador\nand Guatemala were cancelled. The U.S. press, considering the significance of\nthe result, described Caligiuri's goal as \"the shot heard 'round the world\".\nAfter 36 years of absences from the World Cup, the U.S. team qualified for the\n1990 World Cup but its participation in the tournament was brief. They lost\n1\u20135 to Czechoslovakia, 0\u20131 against hosts Italy, and 1\u20132 against Austria. The\nU.S. would consecutively qualify for the next six subsequent World Cups, and\ncouldn't keep the streak going until 2018, because they lost 2\u20131 to Trinidad\nand Tobago during their final qualification game. Trinidad and Tobago suffered\na protracted crisis of confidence until their own World Cup dream finally came\ntrue in 2005, after beating Bahrain 2\u20131 on aggregate in an intercontinental\nplay-off, which allowed the Soca Warriors to qualify to the 2006 FIFA World\nCup in Germany. Yorke and Latapy (survivors of the qualifying campaign of\n1989) were part of that Trinidadian team, which in that World Cup drew against\nSweden 0\u20130 and lost against England 2\u20130 and Paraguay 2\u20130, being eliminated in\nthe first round.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20131 United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Concord Hymn\n\n\"Concord Hymn\" (original title was \"Hymn: Sung at the Completion of the\nConcord Monument, April 19, 1836\") is a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson written\nfor the 1837 dedication of the Obelisk, a monument in Concord, Massachusetts,\ncommemorating the Battle of Concord, the second in a series of battles and\nskirmishes on April 19, 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution.\n\n## History\n\nIn October 1834, Emerson went to live with his step-grandfather Ezra Ripley in\nConcord, at what was later named The Old Manse-- less than a hundred paces\nfrom the spot where the battle took place. In 1835, he purchased a home on the\nCambridge and Concord Turnpike and quickly became one of Concord's leading\ncitizens. That same year he was asked to give a public lecture commemorating\nthe town's 200th anniversary. The \"Concord Hymn\" was written at the request of\nthe Battle Monument Committee. At Concord's Independence Day celebration on\nJuly 4, 1837, it was first read, then sung as a hymn by a local choir using\nthe then-familiar tune \"Old Hundredth\". The poem elevates the battle above a\nsimple event, setting Concord as the spiritual center of the American nation,\nremoves specific details about the battle itself, and exalts a general spirit\nof revolution and freedom-- a spirit Emerson hoped would outlive those who\nfought in the battle. One source of the hymn's power may be Emerson's personal\nties to the subject: his grandfather William Emerson, Sr., witnessed the\nbattle at the North Bridge while living at the Old Manse. Emerson's poem was\nwidely published in newspaper accounts of the dedication; in contrast there is\nno record of Congressman Samuel Hoar's speech that day. The poem, originally\nprinted as a broadside for distribution at the monument's dedication, was\nrepublished as the last poem in Emerson's first edition of Poems in December\n1848 (the book, however, was dated 1847). In that edition the poem appeared\nwith the three line title \"HYMN: / SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD\nMONUMENT, / April 19, 1836.\" Emerson apparently confused the date of the 1837\ndedication a decade earlier, July 4, Independence Day with the anniversary of\nthe battle, April 19, Patriots' Day and the inscription on the obelisk\nmentions that it was erected in 1836. Emerson's line \"the shot heard round the\nworld\" is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution, and the opening\nstanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French The Minute Man statue\ndedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875\ncommemoration of the original battle. \"Concord Hymn\" established Emerson as a\npoet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist. Emerson biographer\nRobert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he\never wrote.

      "# Chess World Cup 2019\n\nThe Chess World Cup 2019 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament\nthat took place in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, from 9 September to 4 October\n2019. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. Radjabov and the\nrunner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the\nWorld Chess Championship 2020. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nLevon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the\nquarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave on tiebreaks.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Teimour Radjabov in the semi-finals.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Yu Yangyi, to claim 3rd place. This tournament\nalso saw Jeffery Xiong (31st seed) progress far, being knocked out in the\nquarter finals to the ultimate champion/winner Teimour Radjabov.\n\n## Bidding process\n\nThere was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad\nevents, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation.\n\n## Format\n\nThe tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round\n6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40\nmoves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30\nseconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of\nfour classical games. If the score is tied after the classical games, rapid\nand, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are\nplayed with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment.\nIn the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10\nminutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two\nblitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied\n4\u20134 after all these games, a single \"Armageddon\" game is played: the player\nwho wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per\ngame and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting\nfrom move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black\nadvances if they win or the game is drawn. The two top finishers qualified for\nthe 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be\nthe top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because\nCarlsen as World Champion does not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had\nalready qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the\nWorld Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the\nprevious edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana\nboth declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply\nthe two finalists.\n\n## Schedule\n\nEach of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular\ntime limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final\nround has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for\ntiebreaks, if required.\n\n  * Round 1: 10 September \u2013 12 September\n  * Round 2: 13 September \u2013 15 September\n  * Round 3: 16 September \u2013 18 September\n  * Rest day: 19 September\n  * Round 4: 20 September \u2013 22 September\n  * Round 5: 23 September \u2013 25 September\n  * Round 6: 26 September \u2013 28 September\n  * Rest day: 29 September\n  * Final and play-off for third place: 30 September \u2013 4 October\n\n## Prize money\n\nThe total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000.\n\n## Participants\n\nThe participants were seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2019.

      "# Shot heard round the world\n\n\"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase that refers to the opening shot\nof the Battle of Concord in 1775, which began the American Revolutionary War\nand led to the creation of the United States of America. The phrase has\nsubsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.\n\n## Skirmish at the North Bridge\n\nThe phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord\nHymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the\nOld North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers\nfell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically,\nno single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots\nwere fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans\nwere killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that\nevent are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the\nfirst shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by\nAmericans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat. The\ntowns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the\nRevolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns.\nHe was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \"birthplace of\nAmerican liberty\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \"first\nforcible resistance\" was made there. President Ulysses S. Grant considered not\nattending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In\n1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as\n\"Lexington Day\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday\nis Patriots' Day. Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time\nwhen he was composing the \"Concord Hymn\", from which his grandfather and\nfather (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located\napproximately from the North Bridge.\n\n## Assassination of Franz Ferdinand\n\nThe phrase \"shot heard round the world\" (alternatively \"shots heard round the\nworld\" or \"shot heard around the world\") has also become associated with the\nassassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June\n1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I.\nSerbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's\nwife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke\nhimself. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,\npropelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.\n\n## Widespread idiomatic use\n\nThe phrase \"Shot heard round the world\" continues to be a stock phrase in the\n21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general. The\nphrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history. In\nbaseball, the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" refers to the game-winning walk-\noff home run by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers\npitcher Ralph Branca to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951.\nThe Giants won the game 5\u20134 as a result of the home run, defeating their\ntraditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually\nlost the World Series to the Yankees. In association football, the shot heard\nround the world refers to Paul Caligiuri's winning goal for the United States\nmen's national soccer team in the final qualifying round for the 1990 FIFA\nWorld Cup on 19 November 1989. The US had not qualified for the World Cup\nsince 1950. The team was in third position of the CONCACAF playoffs before\ntheir final game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The US had to\nwin to go to the finals, their opponents only needed a draw. Defensive\nmidfielder Caliguri, the only full-professional player in the team, received\nthe ball 40 yards out from goal, and instead of passing it to a striker, beat\none defender and launched a 30-yard shot that looped into goal.\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# List of Premier League managers\n\nThe Premier League is a professional football league in England which is the\ntop tier of the English football league system. The league was formed in 1992\nas a replacement for the original First Division. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger holds the\nrecord for most games managed in the Premier League with 828 games, all with\nArsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 games\nwith Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement\nat the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Ferguson, however, remains the most\nsuccessful manager in the Premier League, having won thirteen titles, more\nthan four times as many as any other manager. Sam Allardyce has managed the\nmost teams in the Premier League, having taken charge of seven different\nclubs: Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United,\nSunderland, Crystal Palace and Everton. Many of the managers listed below\nserved as caretaker (temporary) managers in the period between a managerial\ndeparture and appointment. Several of these, however, went on to secure a\npermanent managerial post.\n\n## Managers\n\nThe list of managers includes everyone who has managed clubs while they were\nin the Premier League, whether in a permanent or temporary role. Caretaker\nmanagers are listed only when they managed the team for at least one match in\nthat period. The dates of appointment and departure may fall outside the\nclub's period in the Premier League, for example, Ron Atkinson was appointed\nas Aston Villa manager in 1991 (before the Premier League was formed in 1992)\nand remained in his position through the Premier League's establishment.\nSimilarly, Wolverhampton Wanderers' first spell in the Premier League lasted\nfor only one season (2003\u201304) but manager Dave Jones remained in his position\nuntil November 2004.\n\n### By club\n\n### By nationality\n\n## Most games managed in the Premier League\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of current Premier League and English Football League managers\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n## External links\n\n  * Managers at the official Premier League website\n\n",
      "# List of presidents of the United States\n\nThe president of the United States is the head of state and head of government\nof the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term by the people\nthrough the Electoral College. The officeholder leads the executive branch of\nthe federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States\nArmed Forces. Since the office was established in 1789, 44 men have served as\npresident. The first, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral\nCollege. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office (the only\npresident to have done so) and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th\npresident of the United States; the 45th and current president is Donald Trump\n(since January 20, 2017). There are currently four living former presidents.\nThe most recent former president to die was George H. W. Bush, on November 30,\n2018. The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking\noffice in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt\nserved the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term\nin 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.\nSince the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States\nConstitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice and\nno one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was\nelected may be elected more than once. Of those who have served as the\nnation's president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry\nHarrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four\nwere assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and\nJohn F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment). John\nTyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a\npresidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so\nbecomes the fully functioning president with his own presidency, as opposed to\na caretaker president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution put\nTyler's precedent into law in 1967. It also established a mechanism by which\nan intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon\nwas the first president to fill a vacancy under this provision when he\nselected Gerald Ford for the office following Spiro Agnew's resignation in\n1973. The following year, Ford became the second to do so when he chose Nelson\nRockefeller to succeed him after he acceded to the presidency. As no mechanism\nexisted for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency prior to\n1967, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing\npresidential election and subsequent inauguration. Throughout most of its\nhistory, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The\nConstitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it\ncame into force in 1789, there were no parties. Soon after the 1st Congress\nconvened, factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration\nofficials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Greatly concerned\nabout the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding\nthe nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political\nfaction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains,\nthe only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.\n\n## Presidents\n\n## Subsequent public office\n\nThree presidents held another U.S. federal office after serving as president.\nTwo presidents campaigned unsuccessfully for other U.S. state or federal\nelective offices after serving as president. Many presidents have campaigned\nunsuccessfully for another term as president. Five did so after a gap of at\nleast one term since they served:\n\n## See also\n\n  * Acting president of the United States\n  * Founding Fathers of the United States\n  * List of presidents of the Continental Congress\n  * List of vice presidents of the United States\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Whitehouse.gov: The Presidents\n  * [http://hauensteincenter.org/ Hauenstein Center | Presidential Leadership Studies] at Grand Valley State University\n\n",

He is currently valued at \u00a350 million.\nAside from a brief loan spell at Bristol City in 2013, Dunk has spent the\nentirety of his career at Brighton & Hove Albion. He achieved promotion to the\nPremier League with the club in the 2016\u201317 season, and became the club's\ncaptain from the 2019\u201320 season. Despite failing to be capped at youth level,\nDunk made his senior England debut on 15 November 2018 against the United\nStates.\n\n## Early life\n\nDunk was born in Brighton, East Sussex.

      "# Social distance\n\nSocial distance describes the distance between different groups in society,\nsuch as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality. Different groups\nmix less than members of the same group. It is the measure of nearness or\nintimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group\nin a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the\nextent of perceived likeness of beliefs.\n\n## Definitions\n\nRobert E. Park defined social distance as \"an attempt to reduce to something\nlike measurable terms the grade and degrees of understanding and intimacy\nwhich characterizes personal and social relations generally\". TIn the\nsociology, social distance includes:\n\n  1. Affective social distance: One widespread view of social distance is affectivity. Social distance is associated with affective distance, i.e. how much sympathy the members of a group feel for another group. Emory Bogardus, the creator of \"Bogardus social distance scale\" was typically basing his scale on this subjective-affective conception of social distance: \"[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people.\"\n  2. Normative social distance: A second approach views social distance as a normative category. Normative social distance refers to the widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who should be considered as an \"insider\" and who an \"outsider/foreigner\". Such norms, in other words, specify the distinctions between \"us\" and \"them\". Therefore, normative social distance differs from affective social distance, because it conceives social distance is conceived as a non-subjective, structural aspect of social relations. Examples of this conception can be found in some of the works of sociologists such as Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim and to some extent Robert Park.\n  3. Interactive social distance: Focuses on the frequency and intensity of interactions between two groups, claiming that the more the members of two groups interact, the closer they are socially. This conception is similar to the approaches in sociological network theory, where the frequency of interaction between two parties is used as a measure of the \"strength\" of the social ties between them.\n  4. Cultural and Habitual Distance: Focuses cultural and habitual which is proposed by Bourdieu (1990). This type of distance is influenced by the \"capital\" people possess. \nIt is possible to view these different conceptions as \"dimensions\" of social\ndistance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might\ninteract with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that\nthey will feel \"close\" to each other or that normatively they will consider\neach other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive,\nnormative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly\nassociated. Anthropologist Edward T. Hall explained that social distance has\nbeen extended by technological advances such as the telephone, walkie talkie,\nand television, among others. Hall\u2019s analysis of social distance came before\nthe development of the internet, which has expanded social distance\nexponentially.\n\nInterpersonal distance\n\nHall describes social distance differently, describing the psychological\ndistance which an animal can stand to be away from its group before beginning\nto feel anxious. This phenomenon can be seen in human babies and toddlers who\ncan only walk or crawl so far from their parents or guardians before becoming\nanxious and quickly returning to the safe space. The babies' social distance\nis quite small.\n\n## Prejudice\n\nIt is said that every individual regards his or her own culture as being\nsuperior to all other cultures, and other cultures as being inferior due to\ntheir differences from his or her own culture. The social distance between two\ncultures may ultimately manifest in the form of hatred. A consequence of this\ndistance and hatred is prejudices, that different cultural groups assume to be\ntrue for differing social groups. For example, the Brahmins are believed to\npossess the highest, and the shudras the lowest status in Hindu society. If a\nBrahmin child ever touches the child of some shudra, the former is given a\nbath to rid him of his supposed defilement caused by his touch. As a result of\nthis strict formulation of his activities, the Brahmin child forms a prejudice\nin his mind that shudras are untouchable and impure.\n\n## Ways to study social distance\n\nSome ways social distance can be measured include: direct observation of\npeople interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route\nplanning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see sociogram). In\nquestionnaires, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they\nwould accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not\nthey would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as\na marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately\nmeasure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to\nbecome a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to\nmeasure one's feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What\na person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances\nof the situation. In speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a\nsystematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When\nasked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a\nword\u2019s presence, people respond more quickly when \"we\" was displayed in a\nspatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when \"others\" was\ndisplayed in a spatially distant versus a spatially proximate location. This\nsuggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.\nRoute planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social\ndistance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people\ntend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away\nfrom strangers. This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it\nis for the people passing one another to communicate. There is some evidence\nthat reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared\nprocessing resources in the human parietal cortex. Social periphery is a term\noften used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being\n'distant' with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is\nmeasured from the dominant city \u00e9lite. The social periphery of a city is often\nlocated in the centre. Locational periphery in contrast is used to describe\nplaces physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often\ninclude suburbs which are socially close to the core of the city. In some\ncases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in\nParis' banlieues. In 1991, Mulgan stated that \"The centres of two cities are\noften for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own\nperipheries.\" This reference to social distance is especially true for global\ncities.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Bogardus Social Distance Scale\n  * Social Distance Corollary\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# ICC Champions Trophy\n\nThe ICC Champions Trophy was a One-Day International (ODI) cricket tournament\norganised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), second in importance\nonly to the Cricket World Cup. It was inaugurated as the ICC KnockOut\nTournament in 1998 and has been played approximately every four years since.\nIts name was changed to the Champions Trophy in 2002. The ICC conceived the\nidea of the Champions Trophy \u2013 a short cricket tournament to raise funds for\nthe development of the game in non-test playing countries, with the first\ntournaments being held in Bangladesh and Kenya. Due to its massive commercial\nsuccess, the tournament has been held in nations like India and England as a\nrevenue generator for the ICC, and the number of teams has been reduced to\neight. The tournament, later dubbed as the mini-World Cup as it involved all\nof the full members of the ICC, was planned as a knock-out tournament so that\nit was short and did not reduce the value and importance of the World Cup.\nHowever, from 2002, the tournament has had a round-robin format, followed by a\nfew knockout games but the tournament still takes places over a short period\nof time \u2013 about two weeks. The number of teams competing has varied over the\nyears; originally all the ICC's full members took part, and from 2000 to 2004\nassociate members were also involved. Since 2009, the tournament has only\ninvolved the eight highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Rankings as of six\nmonths prior to the beginning of the tournament. The tournament has been held\nin 7 different countries since its inception, with England hosting it thrice.\nA total of thirteen teams competed in the eight editions of the tournament,\nwith eight competing in the last edition in 2017. ICC Champions Trophy was\nscrapped keeping in line with ICC's goal of having only one pinnacle\ntournament for each of the three formats of international cricket. Australia\nand India have won the tournament twice each (India's 2002 win was shared with\nSri Lanka due to the final being washed out twice), while South Africa, New\nZealand, Sri Lanka (shared with India), West Indies and Pakistan have won it\nonce each. No non-full member team has ever crossed the first round of the\nChampions Trophy.\n\n## Format\n\nUp to 2006 the Champions Trophy was held every two years. The tournament had\nbeen scheduled to be held in Pakistan in 2008 but was moved to South Africa in\n2009 due to security reasons. From then on it has been held every four years\nlike the World Cup. The Champions Trophy differs from the World Cup in a\nnumber of ways. The matches in the Champions Trophy are held over a period of\naround two and a half weeks, while the World Cup can last for over a month.\nThe number of teams in the Champions Trophy are less than the World Cup, with\nthe latest edition of the World Cup having 10 teams whereas the 2017 ICC\nChampions Trophy had 8 teams. For 2002 and 2004, twelve teams played a round-\nrobin tournament in four pools of three, with the top team in each pool moving\nforward to the semi-final. A team would play only four games (two in the pool,\nsemi-final and final) to win the tournament. The format used in the Knock Out\ntournaments differed from the formats used in the Champions Trophy. The\ncompetition was a straight knock out, with no pools and the loser in each game\nbeing eliminated. Only eight games were played in 1998, and 10 games in 2000.\nSince 2006, eight teams have played in two pools of four in a round-robin\nformat, with the top two teams in each pool playing in the semi-finals. Losing\na single match potentially means elimination from the tournament. A total of\n15 matches are played in the present format of the tournament, with the\ntournament lasting about two and a half weeks.\n\n## Results\n\n## Tournament summary\n\nThirteen nations have qualified for the Champions Trophy at least once. Seven\nteams have competed in every finals tournament. Seven different nations have\nwon the title. South Africa won the inaugural tournament, India and Australia\nhave each won twice, while New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Pakistan\nhave each won once. Australia (2006, 2009) is the only nation to have won\nconsecutive titles. Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and England are the only Test playing\nnations not to win the Champions Trophy. England has reached the final twice\nbut lost both times (2004, 2013), Bangladesh reached the semi-finals in 2017\nwhile Zimbabwe has never got past the first round. The highest rank secured by\na non-Test playing nation is the 9th rank achieved by Kenya in 2000. Sri Lanka\nwas the first and only host to win the tournament, in 2002, but they were\ndeclared co-champions with India as the final was twice washed out. England is\nthe only other host to have made the final. It has achieved this twice \u2013 in\n2004 and 2013. Bangladesh is the only host who did not take part in the\ntournament while hosting it, in 1998. Kenya in 2000, India in 2006, and South\nAfrica in 2009 have been the only host teams that were eliminated in the first\nround.\n\n### Teams' performances\n\nComprehensive results for all teams participating in all tournaments for the\nICC Champions Trophy: Legend\n\n  * 1st \u2013 Champions\n  * 2nd \u2013 Runners-up\n  * 3rd and 4th \u2013 Semi-finalists\n  * 5th-8th \u2013 Quarter-finalists (ICC KnockOut Trophy 1998-2000)\n  * 5th-12th \u2013 Group Stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2002-2004)\n  * 5th-8th \u2013 Group Stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2006-2017)\n  * 9th \u2013 Pre Quarter-finalist (ICC KnockOut Trophy 1998)\n  * 9th-11th \u2013 Pre Quarter-finalists (ICC KnockOut Trophy 2000)\n  * 9th and 10th \u2013 Preliminary qualification stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2006)\n  * Q \u2013 Qualified\n  * Apps \u2013 Appearances\n\nNotes\n\n  * The first two tournaments, in 1998 and 2000, were intended to raise the profile of the game in the host nations, Bangladesh and Kenya.\n  * India and Sri Lanka were declared co-champions in 2002.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past\nICC Champions Trophy.

However, due to the crowded\ninternational schedule around that date, and concerns about whether the\nsecurity situation would have changed by that time, there was widespread\nscepticism whether it would actually take place in 2009. On 16 March 2009, an\nannouncement was made that the ICC has recommended that the 2009 ICC Champions\nTrophy be moved from Pakistan to South Africa. On 2 April 2009, Cricket South\nAfrica confirmed that it would host the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy from 24\nSeptember to 5 October.

      "# ICC Champions Trophy\n\nThe ICC Champions Trophy was a One-Day International (ODI) cricket tournament\norganised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), second in importance\nonly to the Cricket World Cup. It was inaugurated as the ICC KnockOut\nTournament in 1998 and has been played approximately every four years since.\nIts name was changed to the Champions Trophy in 2002. The ICC conceived the\nidea of the Champions Trophy \u2013 a short cricket tournament to raise funds for\nthe development of the game in non-test playing countries, with the first\ntournaments being held in Bangladesh and Kenya. Due to its massive commercial\nsuccess, the tournament has been held in nations like India and England as a\nrevenue generator for the ICC, and the number of teams has been reduced to\neight. The tournament, later dubbed as the mini-World Cup as it involved all\nof the full members of the ICC, was planned as a knock-out tournament so that\nit was short and did not reduce the value and importance of the World Cup.\nHowever, from 2002, the tournament has had a round-robin format, followed by a\nfew knockout games but the tournament still takes places over a short period\nof time \u2013 about two weeks. The number of teams competing has varied over the\nyears; originally all the ICC's full members took part, and from 2000 to 2004\nassociate members were also involved. Since 2009, the tournament has only\ninvolved the eight highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Rankings as of six\nmonths prior to the beginning of the tournament. The tournament has been held\nin 7 different countries since its inception, with England hosting it thrice.\nA total of thirteen teams competed in the eight editions of the tournament,\nwith eight competing in the last edition in 2017. ICC Champions Trophy was\nscrapped keeping in line with ICC's goal of having only one pinnacle\ntournament for each of the three formats of international cricket. Australia\nand India have won the tournament twice each (India's 2002 win was shared with\nSri Lanka due to the final being washed out twice), while South Africa, New\nZealand, Sri Lanka (shared with India), West Indies and Pakistan have won it\nonce each. No non-full member team has ever crossed the first round of the\nChampions Trophy.\n\n## Format\n\nUp to 2006 the Champions Trophy was held every two years. The tournament had\nbeen scheduled to be held in Pakistan in 2008 but was moved to South Africa in\n2009 due to security reasons. From then on it has been held every four years\nlike the World Cup. The Champions Trophy differs from the World Cup in a\nnumber of ways. The matches in the Champions Trophy are held over a period of\naround two and a half weeks, while the World Cup can last for over a month.\nThe number of teams in the Champions Trophy are less than the World Cup, with\nthe latest edition of the World Cup having 10 teams whereas the 2017 ICC\nChampions Trophy had 8 teams. For 2002 and 2004, twelve teams played a round-\nrobin tournament in four pools of three, with the top team in each pool moving\nforward to the semi-final. A team would play only four games (two in the pool,\nsemi-final and final) to win the tournament. The format used in the Knock Out\ntournaments differed from the formats used in the Champions Trophy. The\ncompetition was a straight knock out, with no pools and the loser in each game\nbeing eliminated. Only eight games were played in 1998, and 10 games in 2000.\nSince 2006, eight teams have played in two pools of four in a round-robin\nformat, with the top two teams in each pool playing in the semi-finals. Losing\na single match potentially means elimination from the tournament. A total of\n15 matches are played in the present format of the tournament, with the\ntournament lasting about two and a half weeks.\n\n## Results\n\n## Tournament summary\n\nThirteen nations have qualified for the Champions Trophy at least once. Seven\nteams have competed in every finals tournament. Seven different nations have\nwon the title. South Africa won the inaugural tournament, India and Australia\nhave each won twice, while New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Pakistan\nhave each won once. Australia (2006, 2009) is the only nation to have won\nconsecutive titles. Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and England are the only Test playing\nnations not to win the Champions Trophy. England has reached the final twice\nbut lost both times (2004, 2013), Bangladesh reached the semi-finals in 2017\nwhile Zimbabwe has never got past the first round. The highest rank secured by\na non-Test playing nation is the 9th rank achieved by Kenya in 2000. Sri Lanka\nwas the first and only host to win the tournament, in 2002, but they were\ndeclared co-champions with India as the final was twice washed out. England is\nthe only other host to have made the final. It has achieved this twice \u2013 in\n2004 and 2013. Bangladesh is the only host who did not take part in the\ntournament while hosting it, in 1998. Kenya in 2000, India in 2006, and South\nAfrica in 2009 have been the only host teams that were eliminated in the first\nround.\n\n### Teams' performances\n\nComprehensive results for all teams participating in all tournaments for the\nICC Champions Trophy: Legend\n\n  * 1st \u2013 Champions\n  * 2nd \u2013 Runners-up\n  * 3rd and 4th \u2013 Semi-finalists\n  * 5th-8th \u2013 Quarter-finalists (ICC KnockOut Trophy 1998-2000)\n  * 5th-12th \u2013 Group Stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2002-2004)\n  * 5th-8th \u2013 Group Stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2006-2017)\n  * 9th \u2013 Pre Quarter-finalist (ICC KnockOut Trophy 1998)\n  * 9th-11th \u2013 Pre Quarter-finalists (ICC KnockOut Trophy 2000)\n  * 9th and 10th \u2013 Preliminary qualification stage (ICC Champions Trophy 2006)\n  * Q \u2013 Qualified\n  * Apps \u2013 Appearances\n\nNotes\n\n  * The first two tournaments, in 1998 and 2000, were intended to raise the profile of the game in the host nations, Bangladesh and Kenya.\n  * India and Sri Lanka were declared co-champions in 2002.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past\nICC Champions Trophy.

Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed\nonly Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later\npressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit.\n\n## Bing Crosby recording\n\nOn October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for\nChristmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for\nDecca Records; it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix\n#L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the\nsong charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the\nsong reached number 16 on the charts. The U.S. War Department also released\nBing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7,\n1944, Kraft Music Hall broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc,\nas U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix\n#VP1253-D5TC206. The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby\ncompilations. The song touched the hearts of Americans, soldiers and civilians\nalike, in the midst of World War II, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold\nrecord. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at\nChristmas U.S.O. shows. The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more\nfor military morale than anyone else of that era\". Despite the song's\npopularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned\nthe song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might\nlower morale among British troops.\n\n### Charts\n\n## Notable history and cover versions\n\nIn December 1965, astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, while on Gemini 7,\nrequested \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" be played for them by the NASA ground\ncrew. Since the incarnation of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958, cover\nversions by American singers Kelly Clarkson and Josh Groban are the only\nversions of the song to enter the chart.\n\nKelly Clarkson version\n\nMichael Bubl\u00e9 version\n\nBrian McKnight version\n\nPentatonix version\n\nSeth MacFarlane version\n\nJosh Groban version\n\nReba McEntire version\n\nRascal Flatts version\n\nElvis Presley and Carrie Underwood version\n\n## References\n\n## Sources\n\n  * Call number: ML128 .N3 E9.\n  * Call number: ML156.4 .P6 W495 1994.\n\n## External links\n\n",

The song's narrator tells of being with his\ngrandfather, and reading a note that was written by his late grandmother back\nwhen both grandparents were younger. The grandfather explains that he had\nintended to meet her at a certain tree: \"If you get there before I do, don't\ngive up on me / I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how\nlong I'll be / But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see / And\nbetween now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you / Love, me.\" In\nthe second verse, the narrator and his grandfather are at a church where they\nstopped to pray just before the late grandmother died, and the grandfather\nreads the note and begins to cry, that is the first time that he ever saw his\ngrandfather crying.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video was directed by Peter Lippman and premiered in late 1991.\n\n## Chart positions\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Remember Me (T.I. song)\n\n\"Remember Me\" was the planned first single from the re-release of T.I.'s sixth\nalbum, Paper Trail; however, the re-release was eventually shelved, although\nthe song would still be released digitally.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the UK, the song was released as a single and was taken from an EP,\nentitled Paper Trail: Case Closed. It features Mary J. Blige. The song was\nofficially released to urban radio the week of July 7, 2009. The main message\nof the song is remembrance. Its original title was \"Don't Forget.\" The song is\nabout T.I.'s jail sentence and how he wants people to remember him as he is\nnot going to be gone forever, including the verse \"By the time you hear this,\nI'd be half way home.\" It also talks about the hard times in his life and how\nhe does not give up. In the song T.I. mentions Martin Luther King and Malcolm\nX and how he is the modern day version of them. With no promotion the single\nsold over 80,000 downloads in its first week, and it debuted at No. 29 on the\nBillboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video was directed by Jessy Terrero, and follows on from the themes of the\nsong, showing prisoners being forgotten by their significant others while\nincarcerated. A trailer was posted on June 15, 2009, and the full video was\nreleased on July 13, 2009, and it was later released on iTunes on July 28.

Two other prisoners\nare featured in similar scenarios, where they appear outside of their homes\nbut cannot be seen. One inmate sees his girlfriend cheating on him in front of\nhis daughter, and another sees his girlfriend throw a letter he wrote to her\nin a trash can. The video ends with T.I. being released from prison.\n\n## Track listing\n\nDigital single\n\n## Chart Positions\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# I'll Be on My Way\n\n\"I'll Be on My Way\" is a song attributed to John Lennon and Paul McCartney,\nwhich was first released on 26 April 1963 by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas\nas the b-side of their single \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", a song also\nattributed to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The single reached number two in the UK charts\nwhile \"From Me to You\" by the Beatles was occupying the number 1 position.\nAccording to Lennon, the song was written by McCartney: \"This was early Paul.\"\nHowever, there is good evidence that Lennon also contributed to the song.\nAuthor Todd Compton attributes it to \"McCartney\u2013Lennon.\" The Beatles recorded\na version of the song, first released in 1994 on the Live at the BBC\ncompilation.\n\n## Background\n\nIn 1980 Lennon said \"that's Paul on the voids [joys] of driving through the\ncountry.\" \"I'll Be on My Way\" is considered to be the first song that Lennon\nand McCartney \"gave away,\" and the Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas' version\nof the song is included on the EMI album The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave\nAway. In 1963, the Beatles and Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas were both acts\nmanaged by Brian Epstein, with George Martin as their producer. The song may\nhave been influenced by the musical and lyrical style of Buddy Holly. The\npersona forces a happy-go-lucky view on his break-up to make himself feel\nbetter, similar in character to Holly's 1959 song \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore.\"\nAs of July 2019, Paul McCartney's MPL Music and John Lennon's Lenono Music\nowns the copyright on that song along with \"Please Please Me,\" \"Ask Me Why,\"\n\"Love Me Do,\" \"P.S.

      "# As Time Goes By (song)\n\n\"As Time Goes By\" is a song written by Herman Hupfeld in 1931. It became\nfamous when it was featured in the 1942 Warner Bros. film Casablanca performed\nby Dooley Wilson as Sam. The song was voted No. 2 on the AFI's 100 Years...100\nSongs special, commemorating the best songs in film (only surpassed by \"Over\nthe Rainbow\" by Judy Garland). The song has since become the signature tune of\nWarner Bros. and used as such in the production logos at the beginning of many\nWarner Bros. films since 1999, as well as the closing logos to most Warner\nBros. Television shows since 2003. It was also the title and theme song of the\n1990s British romantic comedy series As Time Goes By. The AFI listed it among\nits \"top 100\" movie songs. National Public Radio included it in its \"NPR 100\",\na 1999 list of the most important American musical works of the 20th century\nas compiled by NPR's music editors. The song is a popular reflection of\nnostalgia and often used in films and series reflecting this feeling. This\nsong also re-arranged by Minami Takayama in Love Live! The School Idol Movie\nwhen Honoka Kousaka lost in New York City until she saw her singing.\n\n## Background\n\nHerman Hupfeld wrote \"As Time Goes By\" for the 1931 Broadway musical\nEverybody's Welcome. In the original show, it was sung by Frances Williams. It\nwas recorded that year by several artists, including Rudy Vall\u00e9e and Binnie\nHale, and orchestral recordings were made by Jacques Renard and Fred Rich. In\nterms of popularity at the time, it was a modest hit. Elisabeth Welch included\nthe song in her cabaret act soon after it was released. The song was re-\nintroduced in the 1942 film Casablanca where it was sung by Sam, portrayed by\nDooley Wilson; Sam's piano accompaniment was played by pianist Elliot\nCarpenter. The melody is heard throughout the film as a leitmotif. Wilson was\nunable to make a commercial recording of the song at the time due to the\n1942\u201344 musicians' strike. Unable to record new versions of the song, RCA\nVictor reissued the 1931 recording by Rudy Vall\u00e9e which became a number one\nhit, eleven years after it was originally released. Brunswick also reissued\nthe 1931 Jacques Renard recording. Hupfeld lived his whole life in Montclair,\nNew Jersey, and was a regular customer at the Robin Hood Inn, a tavern built\nin 1922 on Valley Road, then part of Upper Montclair. He spent many hours at\nthe piano and wrote several of his songs in this tavern, now the Valley\nRegency. A plaque on the second floor of the Valley Regency Catering Facility\nin Clifton, New Jersey, commemorates the song. He wrote over one hundred\nsongs, including \"Let's Put Out the Lights and Go to Sleep,\" and the popular\nGreat Depression song \"Are You Making Any Money?\"\n\n## Composition and lyrics\n\nThe original song in the film as sung and played by \"Sam\" was recorded in\nD-flat major, but it has since been played in several keys, commonly C major,\nbut also B-flat major, as in Frank Sinatra's recording, and other keys\nincluding A major and E-flat major, the key in which the song was originally\npublished.

      "# One of These Nights (song)\n\n\"One of These Nights\" is a song written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey and\nrecorded by the American rock band Eagles. The title track from their One of\nThese Nights album, the song became their second single to top the Billboard\nHot 100 chart after \"Best of My Love\" and also helped propel the album to\nnumber one. The single version was shortened from the album version of the\nsong, removing most of the song's intro and most of its fade-out, as well.\nHenley is lead vocalist on the verses, while Randy Meisner sings high harmony\n(not lead) on the refrain. The song features a guitar solo by Don Felder that\nis \"composed of blues-based licks and sustained string bends using an\nunusually meaty distortion tone.\"\n\n## Background\n\nThe song was a conscious attempt by the band to write something different from\na country-rock and ballad-type song. Don Henley said: \"We like to be a nice\nlittle country-rock band from Los Angeles ... about half the time.\" He added:\n\"We wanted to get away from the ballad syndrome with \"One of These Nights.\"\nWith Don Felder in the band now, we can really rock.\" Frey said that they\n\"wanted 'One of These Nights' to have a lot of teeth, a lot of bite\u2014a nasty\ntrack with pretty vocals.\" The writing was influenced by R&B; music and disco;\naccording to Frey, he was listening to Spinners and Al Green records when he\nstarted writing the song. Frey started the writing process by composing the\nmusic, and Henley then started with the lyrics. Frey said: \"I just went over\nto the piano and I started playing this little minor descending progression,\nand he comes over and goes, 'One of these nights'.\" After that, Frey said:\n\"What usually happens is when we get the thing fused together, he gets\ninvolved in the music and I get involved in the lyrics.\" While they were\nrecording the album in Miami, the band also shared a studio with the Bee Gees,\nand according to Henley, the \"four-on-the-floor\" bass-drum pattern is a nod to\ndisco. In the liner notes of The Very Best Of, Frey had this to say about the\nsong: Frey also said that the song is about putting things off. \"We've all\nsaid, 'One of these nights I'm gonna do something -- get that girl, make that\nmoney, find that house.' We all have our dreams \u2013 a vision we hope will come\ntrue someday. When that 'someday' will come is up to each of us.\" On the\nrecording, Frey said: \"We cut the basic track in Miami in December at Criteria\nStudios. We took it to L.A., put all the drone guitars and Felder's solo on in\nL.A., and went back to Miami to put the vocals on in March.\" The B-side,\n\"Visions\", features lead vocals by guitarist Don Felder, the only Eagles song\nto do so.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Don Henley \u2013 lead vocals, drums\n  * Glenn Frey \u2013 piano, backing vocals\n  * Don Felder \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar\n  * Randy Meisner \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\n  * Bernie Leadon \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Get Up Offa That Thing\n\n\"Get Up Offa That Thing\" is a song written and performed by James Brown. It\nwas released in 1976 as a two-part single (the B-side, titled \"Release the\nPressure\", is a continuation of the same song). It reached #4 on the R&B;\nchart, briefly returning Brown to the Top Ten after a year's absence, and #45\non the Billboard Hot 100. Thanks to its chart success, the song became Brown's\nbiggest hit of the late 1970s. The song's lyrics urge listeners to \"Get up\noffa that thing / and dance 'til you feel better.\" Due to his troubles with\nthe IRS for failure to pay back taxes, Brown credited authorship of the song\nto his wife Diedre and their daughters, Deanna and Yamma Brown.\n\n## Background\n\nAccording to Brown, the inspiration for \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" came to him\nduring a club performance in Fort Lauderdale:The audience was sitting down,\ntrying to do a sophisticated thing, listening to funk. One of the tightest\nbands they'd ever heard in their lives, and they were sitting. I had worked\nhard and dehydrated myself and was feeling depressed. I looked out at all\nthose people sitting there, and because I was depressed they looked depressed.\nI yelled, \"Get up offa that thing and dance til you feel better!\" I probably\nmeant until I felt better. Unlike most popular music of the time, which made\nsophisticated use of multitrack recording and other techniques, \"Get Up Offa\nThat Thing\" was recorded live in the studio in only two takes. Brown re-\nrecorded \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" for the Doctor Detroit soundtrack album. He\nalso performs the song during his guest appearance in the film.

      "# Ventura Highway\n\n\"Ventura Highway\" is a 1972 song by the band America from their album\nHomecoming.\n\n## Background\n\nDewey Bunnell, the song's vocalist and writer, has said that the lyric\n\"alligator lizards in the air\" in the song is a reference to the shapes of\nclouds in the sky he saw in 1963 while his family was driving down the coast\nfrom Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California, where they had a flat\ntire. While his father changed the tire, his brother and he stood by the side\nof the road and watched the clouds and saw a road sign for \"Ventura\". In the\nbooklet for the boxed set, Highway, he states that the song \"reminds me of the\ntime I lived in Omaha as a kid and how we'd walk through cornfields and chew\non pieces of grass. There were cold winters, and I had images of going to\nCalifornia. So I think in the song I'm talking to myself, frankly: 'How long\nyou gonna stay here, Joe?' I really believe that 'Ventura Highway' has the\nmost lasting power of all my songs. It's not just the words \u2014 the song and the\ntrack have a certain fresh, vibrant, optimistic quality that I can still\nrespond to\". The song has a \"Go West, young man\" motif in the structure of a\nconversation between an old man named Joe and a young and hopeful kid. Joe was\nmodeled after a \"grumpy\" old man he had met while his dad was stationed in\nBiloxi, Mississippi at Keesler Air Force Base. He also stated \"I remember\nvividly having this mental picture of the stretch of the coastline traveling\nwith my family when I was younger. Ventura Highway itself, there is no such\nbeast, what I was really trying to depict was the Pacific Coast Highway,\nHighway 1, which goes up to the town of Ventura.\" \"That's Gerry and Dan doing\na harmony on two guitars on the intro. I remember us sitting in a hotel room,\nand I was playing the chords, and Gerry got that guitar line, and he and Dan\nworked out that harmony part. That's really the hook of the song\".\n\n## Reception\n\nThe song went to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 for America, spending 12\nweeks on the charts after debuting on October 21, 1972. It also reached number\n43 in the UK Singles Chart, staying in that chart for 4 weeks.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe song contains the phrase \"purple rain\", later the title of a 1984 song,\nalbum, and film (and the tour that supported both the album and film), from\nthe artist Prince. Although whether actually any connection exists, both Mikel\nToombs of The San Diego Union and Bob Kostanczuk of the Post-Tribune have\nwritten that Prince got the title directly from \"Ventura Highway\". Asked to\nexplain the phrase \"purple rain\" in \"Ventura Highway,\" Gerry Beckley\nresponded: \"You got me.\" The song won many fans, including the pro wrestler-\nturned-politician, Jesse Ventura. Bunnell recalled, \"We went and played at\nGovernor Jesse Ventura's inaugural out in Minneapolis. He asked us to \u2014 his\nwife is a horse lady, and she'd always loved 'A Horse with No Name', and he\nhad adopted this name Ventura. So when he put together his cast of characters\nfor his big inaugural celebration, he wanted us to come and play two songs,\nwhich we did\".\n\n## Chart performance\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## Sampling and cover versions\n\n  * The song's opening guitar riff and musical hook is sampled throughout Janet Jackson's 2001 song \"Someone to Call My Lover\" by the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis who were influenced by America and \"Ventura Highway\" listening to KDWB 63 AM (Top 40) growing up in Minneapolis, Minnesota (along with their close friend, musician Prince). Bunnell said the use of the sample from \"Ventura Highway\" and the production by Jam, Lewis and Jackson boosted sales for America.\n\n  * In 2004, the song was recorded by Paul Hardcastle for the compilation album Jazzmasters (The Smooth Cuts) featuring Helen Rogers on vocals.\n\n  * In 2012, the song was recorded by the private party band The Gypsy Queens for their album The Gypsy Queens, featuring Booker T. Jones, as well as Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (author of the song) of the original America line-up. The album was produced by multiple Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. It was recorded at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles (Jim Henson Company). The album reached number 46 in the UK charts.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Love, Me\n\n\"Love, Me\" is a song written by Skip Ewing and Max T. Barnes, and recorded by\nAmerican country music artist Collin Raye. It was released in October 1991 as\nthe second single from the album All I Can Be. In January 1992, the single\nbecame Raye's first Number One single on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country\nSingles & Tracks charts; the same year, the song received a Song of the Year\nnomination from the Country Music Association. The single has been cited as a\npopular choice for funerals.\n\n## Content\n\n\"Love, Me\" is a ballad in the key of C major, accompanied by Fender Rhodes\nelectric piano and steel-string acoustic guitar. It tells of a couple who\npromise to love each other. The song's narrator tells of being with his\ngrandfather, and reading a note that was written by his late grandmother back\nwhen both grandparents were younger. The grandfather explains that he had\nintended to meet her at a certain tree: \"If you get there before I do, don't\ngive up on me / I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how\nlong I'll be / But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see / And\nbetween now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you / Love, me.\" In\nthe second verse, the narrator and his grandfather are at a church where they\nstopped to pray just before the late grandmother died, and the grandfather\nreads the note and begins to cry, that is the first time that he ever saw his\ngrandfather crying.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video was directed by Peter Lippman and premiered in late 1991.\n\n## Chart positions\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# As Time Goes By (song)\n\n\"As Time Goes By\" is a song written by Herman Hupfeld in 1931. It became\nfamous when it was featured in the 1942 Warner Bros. film Casablanca performed\nby Dooley Wilson as Sam. The song was voted No. 2 on the AFI's 100 Years...100\nSongs special, commemorating the best songs in film (only surpassed by \"Over\nthe Rainbow\" by Judy Garland). The song has since become the signature tune of\nWarner Bros. and used as such in the production logos at the beginning of many\nWarner Bros. films since 1999, as well as the closing logos to most Warner\nBros. Television shows since 2003. It was also the title and theme song of the\n1990s British romantic comedy series As Time Goes By. The AFI listed it among\nits \"top 100\" movie songs. National Public Radio included it in its \"NPR 100\",\na 1999 list of the most important American musical works of the 20th century\nas compiled by NPR's music editors. The song is a popular reflection of\nnostalgia and often used in films and series reflecting this feeling. This\nsong also re-arranged by Minami Takayama in Love Live! The School Idol Movie\nwhen Honoka Kousaka lost in New York City until she saw her singing.\n\n## Background\n\nHerman Hupfeld wrote \"As Time Goes By\" for the 1931 Broadway musical\nEverybody's Welcome. In the original show, it was sung by Frances Williams. It\nwas recorded that year by several artists, including Rudy Vall\u00e9e and Binnie\nHale, and orchestral recordings were made by Jacques Renard and Fred Rich. In\nterms of popularity at the time, it was a modest hit. Elisabeth Welch included\nthe song in her cabaret act soon after it was released. The song was re-\nintroduced in the 1942 film Casablanca where it was sung by Sam, portrayed by\nDooley Wilson; Sam's piano accompaniment was played by pianist Elliot\nCarpenter. The melody is heard throughout the film as a leitmotif. Wilson was\nunable to make a commercial recording of the song at the time due to the\n1942\u201344 musicians' strike. Unable to record new versions of the song, RCA\nVictor reissued the 1931 recording by Rudy Vall\u00e9e which became a number one\nhit, eleven years after it was originally released. Brunswick also reissued\nthe 1931 Jacques Renard recording. Hupfeld lived his whole life in Montclair,\nNew Jersey, and was a regular customer at the Robin Hood Inn, a tavern built\nin 1922 on Valley Road, then part of Upper Montclair. He spent many hours at\nthe piano and wrote several of his songs in this tavern, now the Valley\nRegency. A plaque on the second floor of the Valley Regency Catering Facility\nin Clifton, New Jersey, commemorates the song. He wrote over one hundred\nsongs, including \"Let's Put Out the Lights and Go to Sleep,\" and the popular\nGreat Depression song \"Are You Making Any Money?\"\n\n## Composition and lyrics\n\nThe original song in the film as sung and played by \"Sam\" was recorded in\nD-flat major, but it has since been played in several keys, commonly C major,\nbut also B-flat major, as in Frank Sinatra's recording, and other keys\nincluding A major and E-flat major, the key in which the song was originally\npublished. In Casablanca, Wilson sings the chorus (\"You must remember\nthis...\"), but does not sing the verse (\"This day and age we're living\nin...\"). The omitted lines refer to Albert Einstein.\n\n## References\n\n"

    "question": "Who sings with Meatloaf when promoting \"I'd Do Anything for Love\"?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\n\n\"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\" is a song written by Jim\nSteinman, and recorded by Meat Loaf with Lorraine Crosby. The song was\nreleased in 1993 as the first single from the album . The last six verses\nfeature a female singer who was credited only as \"Mrs. Loud\" in the album\nnotes. She was later identified as Lorraine Crosby. However, she does not\nappear in the video, in which her vocals are lip-synched by Dana Patrick. Meat\nLoaf promoted the single with US vocalist Patti Russo. The power ballad was a\ncommercial success, reaching number one in 28 countries. The single was\ncertified platinum in the United States and became Meat Loaf's first and only\nnumber-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, and\nwas the best-selling single of 1993 in the United Kingdom. The song earned\nMeat Loaf a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo.\n\n## Music and lyrics\n\nThe timings in this article refer to the original album version. There are\nmany shorter single and radio edits. The song opens with a guitar played to\nsound like a revving motorcycle. Roy Bittan's piano begins to play along with\nthe guitars and drums. The vocals begin at the 1:50 point. The opening vocals\nare accompanied by piano and backing vocals. The song then becomes much louder\nas the band, predominantly piano, plays the main melody for twenty seconds. An\ninstrumental section follows the first verse and chorus, lasting over 45\nseconds, with piano playing the title melody, accompanied by guitar and\nwordless background vocals by Todd Rundgren, Rory Dodd and Kasim Sulton. The\nlead vocals recommence with another verse. The phrase \"sex, drugs and rock 'n'\nroll\" was changed to \"Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and\nrock and roll\" on the recording, although Meat Loaf occasionally sings the\nmore familiar phrase in concert.\n\n### Duet coda\n\nAt the 9:28 point, the song transforms into a duet coda. The structure of the\nverses remains, but the woman now asks what the man would do. He answers in\nthe affirmative for the first four sections. The song's tone changes for the\nfinal two sections, in which the woman, Lorraine Crosby on the original\nrecorded version, predicts that the man would eventually do things to upset\nher and their relationship. Both times, he denies it. The duet part was and\nstill is performed regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured\nfemale vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years their interplay\nduring the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly\ncomedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For\nexample, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings \"After a while you'll\nforget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling\",\nMeat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): \"Why do you\nsay this to me? Why do you keep saying these things to me every single\nnight?\", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): \"It's in the lyrics\".\nMore funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets,\nsuch as the famous Bat Out of Hell track \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\".\n\n### Perceived ambiguity of \"that\"\n\nMeat Loaf says that the question, \"What is 'that'?\" is one of the most popular\nquestions he is asked. Each verse mentions two things that the man would do\nfor love, followed by one thing that he will not do. The title phrase\nrepetition reasserts that he \"won't do that.\" Each mention of \"that\" is a\nreference to the particular promise that he made earlier in the same verse.\nThe four things he says he will never do are:\n\n  * \"forget the way you feel right now\"\n  * \"forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight\"\n  * \"do it better than I do it with you\"\n  * \"stop dreaming of you every night of my life\"\n\nAt the song's conclusion, the woman predicts two things that he will do:\n\"You'll see that it's time to move on\", and \"You'll be screwing around.\" To\nboth of these, the male emphatically responds, \"I won't do that!\" In his 1998\nVH1 Storytellers special, Meat Loaf even explained it on stage using a\nblackboard and a pointing stick. In a 1993 promotional interview, Steinman\nstates that the definition of \"that\" is fully revealed in the song in each of\nthe several verses in which it is mentioned. This sense would have been more\nclear if the lyric had been \"and I won't do that\" instead of \"but I won't do\nthat.\" It is the use of \"but\" instead of \"and\" that leads to the ambiguity. It\nsort of is a little puzzle and I guess it goes by - but they're all great\nthings. 'I won't stop doing beautiful things and I won't do bad things.' It's\nvery noble. I'm very proud of that song because it's very much like out of the\nworld of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble\nand chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.\nMeat Loaf believed that the lyrics were unambiguous, but Steinman predicted\nthat they would cause confusion. An early episode of the VH1 program Pop-up\nVideo made this claim at the end of the song's video: \"Exactly what Meat Loaf\nwon't do for love remains a mystery to this day.\" A reviewer writing for\nAllMusic commented that \"The lyrics build suspense by portraying a romance-\nconsumed lover who pledges to do anything in the name of love except 'that,' a\nmysterious thing that he will not specify.\" Frank O'day says the lyrics\nprovide \"an enlightening example of how listeners project their own thoughts,\nvalues, and concerns onto the meaning of the song with misconstrued lyrics.\"\nThe phrase \"I would do anything for love but I won't do that\" had previously\nappeared as a spoken interlude in the song \"Getting So Excited,\" released in\n1983 by Bonnie Tyler in her album Faster Than the Speed of Night. In this\nsong, the phrase's meaning is more clear: a woman is refusing an offensive\nproposal. Steinman produced this record and wrote many of the songs but this\nsong is credited to Alan Gruner.\n\n### Length\n\nSteinman's songs are usually long, and \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't\nDo That)\" is no exception. The song is a full 12 minutes, and Steinman was\ndeeply upset when executives advised him that he had to cut it down to get\nradio play. Manager Allen Kovac warned that any song over five minutes would\nnot be played on radio, saying that if Steinman and the group did not make the\ncuts then the stations would. Even after they made the cuts, Steinman sent his\nown version to the stations. The single version was edited down to five\nminutes and 13 seconds, with the motorcycle introduction omitted. The video\nversion (which also appears on many international releases of the single) was\nwhittled down to seven minutes and 38 seconds, with part of the motorcycle\nintro remaining. In the video version and single version, the lengthy\ninstrumental break is completely omitted. In the video and single versions,\nthe refrain is abridged as well; Lorraine Crosby sings six verses in the\ncomplete song. In the video version, the second and third verses are omitted.\nIn the single version, the second, third, and fifth verses are omitted.\n\n## Recording\n\nLorraine Crosby, a singer from England, was the guest singer, though AllMusic\nincorrectly attributes the female vocals to Ellen Foley. Crosby and her\npartner Stuart Emerson had moved to Los Angeles to work with Steinman, who\nbecame their manager. He secured them a contract with Meat Loaf's label MCA.\nWhile visiting the company's studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to\nprovide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording \"I'd Do Anything for\nLove\". Crosby recalls, \"In I went and sang it twice and I never thought\nanything more of it until six months later when I got a phone call saying,\n'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'\" As Crosby had recorded her part as\nguide vocals, she received no royalties from the song. Cher, Melissa Etheridge\nand Bonnie Tyler had been considered for the role. Tyler, who described Crosby\nas \"a great friend of mine from Newcastle\", said: \"Meat Loaf was naughty,\nreally: he gave her no acknowledgement on the album but I think her part\nreally made that song.\"\n\n## Music video\n\nMichael Bay directed the music video. He also directed the videos for \"Objects\nin the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are\" and \"Rock and Roll\nDreams Come Through\", also from Bat Out of Hell II. Filming took place in Los\nAngeles County, California in July 1993; the opening chase was filmed at\nCh\u00e1vez Ravine, with the interior mansion scenes filmed at Greystone Mansion in\nBeverly Hills. The cinematographer was Daniel Pearl, particularly known for\nfilming The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in 1973. Pearl says that this video \"is\none of my personal all-time favorite projects... I think the cinematography is\npure, and it tells a story about the song.\" The video is based on Beauty and\nthe Beast and The Phantom of the Opera. Bob Keane did Meat Loaf's make-up,\nwhich took up to two hours to apply. The make-up was designed to be simple and\nscary, yet \"with the ability to make him sympathetic.\" It went over budget,\nand was filmed in heat, across four days. According to one executive, it\n\"probably had the budget of Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" It is the abridged\nseven-minute version, rather than the twelve-minute (11:58) album version. The\nactress in the video, Dana Patrick, is miming to Crosby's vocals; she did the\nsame for Patti Russo's vocals in the 1995 song \"I'd Lie for You (And That's\nthe Truth)\". According to the captions aired on Pop-Up Video, Patrick received\nseveral offers for record deals after the video aired, from executives who\nassumed she was actually singing in the video.\n\n### Synopsis\n\nThe story begins with the opening credits saying: \"I have travelled across the\nuniverse through the years to find her. Sometimes going all the way is just a\nstart.\" We then see \"The Beast\" character - a deformed man portrayed by Meat\nLoaf, on a motorbike being chased by police officers and a helicopter. As the\nchase continues into night, the Beast passes through into a graveyard and into\nwhat appears to be a very ornate mausoleum hiding from his pursuers. He\nmournfully examines his deformed hands and features; as the officers enter and\nexamine the mausoleum he crashes through the wall with his motorbike and he\naccidentally knocks down a police officer (whose shotgun goes off) and causes\none of the chandeliers on the ceiling to fall and kill the officer. In\ndesperation the Beast flees into the nearby woods where he comes across a\nbeautiful woman bathing/cooling herself by a fountain. The woman appears to be\nin sunny daylight, while the rest of the woods and castle clearly show that it\nis night-time. The woman looks into a mirror and glimpses the Beast watching\nher. She turns and he flees leaving only an amulet hanging on a branch. The\nwoman picks it up and pursues him. As she approaches the castle, the Beast is\nwatching her movements through the reflection of his drink. As she comes into\nthe castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits in his chair\nand rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and\ncontemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is\nseen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead\nofficer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to\nsleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast sits in a chair (a\nreference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing\nhis reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise,\ncomes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes\nher from above and levitates the chair she is sitting on. The Beast, then\nhearing the officers are near moves away, pulls the chair back down breaking a\nlamp. The two run away and the woman removes the Beast's hood so she can look\nat him clearly. She accepts him and caresses his face while they embrace. As\nthey pull away, the Beast is returned to his human form, and the two disappear\njust before the police catch them. The woman and the transformed Beast finally\nride off into the sunrise on his motorbike.\n\n## Use in media\n\nIn 2013, the song was covered in an M&M;'s commercial which aired during Super\nBowl XLVII. The song is featured in the animated comedy Sausage Party and on\nits soundtrack. In the film the song is performed by an anthropomorphic\nmeatloaf caricature of the singer. It was used in a 2017 commercial for\nCarvana and in the trailer for the 2018 comedy Blockers. The song also\nappeared on the EP Fire & Ashes by German symphonic metal band Xandria. On\nthis version, Meat Loaf's vocal parts are done by Dianne van Giersbergen,\nwhile Lorraine Crosby's vocal parts are done by Valerio Recenti, singer of the\nDutch rock band My Propane.\n\n## Track listing\n\nThe single cover is a cropped version of the painting Leavetaking by fantasy\nillustrator Michael Whelan, who also painted the Bat Out of Hell II cover.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe song reached number one in the charts in 28 countries. In most countries,\nit was Meat Loaf's first and only number one solo single. It was number one in\nthe US for five weeks and sold over 1.4 million copies there. In the UK, it\ntopped the singles chart, and at seven minutes and 52 seconds, \"I'd Do\nAnything for Love\" becoming the longest song on top there since The Beatles'\nhit \"Hey Jude\". This was then broken when Oasis released their 1997 single\n\"All Around the World\", clocking in at 9 minutes and 20 seconds. In the UK,\nthis was the biggest hit of 1993, selling 761,200 copies and staying at number\none for seven weeks. As a result of its success, \"Bat Out of Hell\" was\nreissued in the UK, this time reaching the top ten (which it did not achieve\non its first release in 1979), meaning Meat Loaf achieved the rare feat of\nhaving two singles in the UK top ten at the same time. In Germany, the song is\nthe 7th best-selling pop hymn ever. Critical reaction was mixed. AllMusic said\nthat \"Meat Loaf sells the borderline-campy lyrics with a full-throated vocal\nwhose stirring sense of conviction brings out the heart hidden behind the\nclever phrases.\" Meat Loaf won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance,\nSolo for the song. British adventurer Bear Grylls cites this song as his\ninspiration to apply for selection into the SAS: \"Enthusiasm and determination\ncount for so much more than skills, brains or qualifications... and all this\nexpressed itself to me through Meatloaf's song!\".\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n### Decade-end charts\n\n## Certifications\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\n\n\"Anything You Can Do\" is a song composed by Irving Berlin for the 1946\nBroadway musical Annie Get Your Gun. The song is a duet, with one male singer\nand one female singer attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex\ntasks. In the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting\ncontest between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler.

      "# Solomon Skuza\n\nSolomon Skuza (1954\u20131995), also known as Jah Solo was a Zimbabwean musician,\none of the most popular to come out of Plumtree. In addition to his native\nKalanga, he wrote lyrics in Ndebele, Shona and English as well. Other popular\nKalanga musicians include Nduna Malaba (Ndux Malax), Ndolwane Super Sounds,\nMokis Connection and Solomon's brother Chase Skuza.\n\n## Biography\n\nBorn in 1954 in Plumtree, Solomon Skuza went into exile in Zambia during the\nRhodesian Bush War to join the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).\nSkuza played in the ZIPRA band and entertained guerrillas at ZIPRA camps. He\nlater became the band leader and an official composer for the ZIPRA\nEntertainment Corps. In 1980, Skuza returned to Zimbabwe and produced a hit\nsingle, Banolila, which sold over 75,000 copies. His 1990 album, Love and\nScandals, was a commercial and critical success, due to its political content\nregarding the Willowgate Scandal of the time. In one song, he asks, \"how can\nsomeone buy a car and sell it again?\" In another, he sings of his love leaving\nhim for \"a guy who owns a Cressida\", referring to the Toyota Cressidas\nassembled at Willowvale. It was this album that earned him the nickname \"Jah\nSolo.\" Solomon Skuza was backed by bands such as Fallen Heroes. He named the\nband \"Fallen Heroes\" to honor those who had died during the Liberation\nStruggle.He released Zihlangene Vol. 1 and Zihlangene Vol. 2 compilation\nalbums which cover his earlier and later hits, respectively. Solomon sang in\nhis native Kalanga and both Ndebele, English and Shona. In 1990 he did a\nsoundtrack, Patimile, for the Zimbabwean film Jit.\n\n## Sickness and Death\n\nSolomon was shot during the war that is why he could not dance during his\nperformances. The actual cause of Solomon Skuza's death remains unknown.\nDuring his sickness period, Solomon was taken to some traditional healers\n(known as 'inyanga') but, they could not ascertain his cause of sickness. He\nalso went to doctors who, like the nyangas, could not see anything.\nConsequently, Solomon died in 1995.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Albums\n\n  * Kudzanayi\n  * Love and Scandals\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 1\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 2\n  * Zlhlangene Vol. 3\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Solomon Skuza\", Music of Zimbabwe\n\n",

It was released in October 1991 as\nthe second single from the album All I Can Be. In January 1992, the single\nbecame Raye's first Number One single on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country\nSingles & Tracks charts; the same year, the song received a Song of the Year\nnomination from the Country Music Association. The single has been cited as a\npopular choice for funerals.\n\n## Content\n\n\"Love, Me\" is a ballad in the key of C major, accompanied by Fender Rhodes\nelectric piano and steel-string acoustic guitar. It tells of a couple who\npromise to love each other. The song's narrator tells of being with his\ngrandfather, and reading a note that was written by his late grandmother back\nwhen both grandparents were younger. The grandfather explains that he had\nintended to meet her at a certain tree: \"If you get there before I do, don't\ngive up on me / I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how\nlong I'll be / But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see / And\nbetween now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you / Love, me.\" In\nthe second verse, the narrator and his grandfather are at a church where they\nstopped to pray just before the late grandmother died, and the grandfather\nreads the note and begins to cry, that is the first time that he ever saw his\ngrandfather crying.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video was directed by Peter Lippman and premiered in late 1991.\n\n## Chart positions\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# One of These Nights (song)\n\n\"One of These Nights\" is a song written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey and\nrecorded by the American rock band Eagles. The title track from their One of\nThese Nights album, the song became their second single to top the Billboard\nHot 100 chart after \"Best of My Love\" and also helped propel the album to\nnumber one. The single version was shortened from the album version of the\nsong, removing most of the song's intro and most of its fade-out, as well.\nHenley is lead vocalist on the verses, while Randy Meisner sings high harmony\n(not lead) on the refrain. The song features a guitar solo by Don Felder that\nis \"composed of blues-based licks and sustained string bends using an\nunusually meaty distortion tone.\"\n\n## Background\n\nThe song was a conscious attempt by the band to write something different from\na country-rock and ballad-type song. Don Henley said: \"We like to be a nice\nlittle country-rock band from Los Angeles ... about half the time.\" He added:\n\"We wanted to get away from the ballad syndrome with \"One of These Nights.\"\nWith Don Felder in the band now, we can really rock.\" Frey said that they\n\"wanted 'One of These Nights' to have a lot of teeth, a lot of bite\u2014a nasty\ntrack with pretty vocals.\" The writing was influenced by R&B; music and disco;\naccording to Frey, he was listening to Spinners and Al Green records when he\nstarted writing the song. Frey started the writing process by composing the\nmusic, and Henley then started with the lyrics. Frey said: \"I just went over\nto the piano and I started playing this little minor descending progression,\nand he comes over and goes, 'One of these nights'.\" After that, Frey said:\n\"What usually happens is when we get the thing fused together, he gets\ninvolved in the music and I get involved in the lyrics.\" While they were\nrecording the album in Miami, the band also shared a studio with the Bee Gees,\nand according to Henley, the \"four-on-the-floor\" bass-drum pattern is a nod to\ndisco. In the liner notes of The Very Best Of, Frey had this to say about the\nsong: Frey also said that the song is about putting things off. \"We've all\nsaid, 'One of these nights I'm gonna do something -- get that girl, make that\nmoney, find that house.' We all have our dreams \u2013 a vision we hope will come\ntrue someday. When that 'someday' will come is up to each of us.\" On the\nrecording, Frey said: \"We cut the basic track in Miami in December at Criteria\nStudios. We took it to L.A., put all the drone guitars and Felder's solo on in\nL.A., and went back to Miami to put the vocals on in March.\" The B-side,\n\"Visions\", features lead vocals by guitarist Don Felder, the only Eagles song\nto do so.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Don Henley \u2013 lead vocals, drums\n  * Glenn Frey \u2013 piano, backing vocals\n  * Don Felder \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar\n  * Randy Meisner \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\n  * Bernie Leadon \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain\n\nZiehl-Neelsen staining is a type of Acid-fast stain, first introduced by Paul\nEhrlich. Ziehl\u2013Neelsen staining is a bacteriological stain used to identify\nacid-fast organisms, mainly Mycobacteria. It is named for two German doctors\nwho modified the stain: the bacteriologist Franz Ziehl (1859\u20131926) and the\npathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854\u20131898).\n\n## Mycobacteria\n\nThe genus Mycobacterium is a slow growing bacteria, made up of small rods that\nare slightly curved or straight, and are considered to be gram positive. Some\ntypes of Mycobacteria form branches or filaments. Some mycobacteria are free-\nliving saprophytes, but many are pathogens that cause disease in animals and\nhumans. Mycobacterium bovis causes tuberculosis in cattle. Since tuberculosis\ncan be spread to humans, milk is pasteurized to kill any of the bacteria.Some\nMycobacteria species that cause disease in humans include Mycobacterium\nleprae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium bovis,\nMycobacterium africanum and members of the Mycobacterium avium complex.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is a species of Mycobacterium that causes\ntuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that\ntypically infects the human lungs. Symptoms of TB include a bad cough, chest\npain, fatigue, weight loss, no appetite, chills, fever and night sweats. The\ntypical regimen for treating a Latent TB infection includes the use of\nisoniazid, rifapentine, and rifampin. The regimen is changed for those who\nhave developed a drug resistant strain of TB. Testing for TB includes blood\ntesting, skin tests, and chest x-rays. When looking at the smears for TB, it\nis stained using and acid-fast stain. These Acid-fast organisms like\nMycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell\nwalls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods\nsuch as a Gram stain. It can also be used to stain a few other bacteria, such\nas Nocardia. The reagents used for Ziehl\u2013Neelsen staining are \u2013 carbol\nfuchsin, acid alcohol, and methylene blue. Acid-fast bacilli are bright red\nafter staining.\n\n## Fungi\n\nZiehl-Neelsen staining is a type of narrow spectrum fungal stain. Narrow\nspectrum fungal stains are selective, and they can help differentiate and\nidentify fungi. The results of ZIehl- Neelsen staining is variable because\nmany fungal cell walls are not acid fast. An example of a common type of acid-\nfast fungus that is usually stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining is called\nHistoplasma (HP). Histoplasma is found in soil and the feces of birds and\nbats. Humans can contract histoplasmosis by inhalation of the fungal spores.\nHistoplasma enters the body and goes to the lungs where the spores turn into\nyeast. The yeast gets into the blood stream and affects lymph nodes and other\nparts of the body. Usually people do not get sick from inhaling the spores,\nbut if they do they usually have flu like symptoms. Another variation on this\nstaining method is used in mycology to differentially stain acid-fast\nincrustations in the cuticular hyphae of certain species of fungi in the genus\nRussula. Some free endospores can be confused with small yeasts, so staining\nis used to identify the unknown fungi. It is also useful in the identification\nof some protozoa, namely Cryptosporidium and Isospora. The Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain\ncan also hinder diagnosis in the case of paragonimiasis because the eggs in\nsputum sample for ovum and parasite (O&P;) can be dissolved by the stain, and\nis often used in this clinical setting because signs and symptoms of\nparagonimiasis closely resemble those of TB.\n\n## History\n\nIn 1882 Robert Koch discovered the etiology of tuberculosis. Soon after Koch\u2019s\ndiscovery, Paul Ehrlich developed a stain for mycobacterium tuberculosis,\ncalled the alum hematoxylin stain. Franz Ziehl then altered Ehrlich\u2019s staining\ntechnique by using carbolic acid as the mordant. Friedrich Neelsen kept\nZiehl\u2019s choice of mordant but changed the primary stain to carbol fuchsin.\nZiehl and Neelsen\u2019s modifications together have developed the Ziehl-Neelsen\nstain. Another acid-fast satin was developed by Joseph Kinyoun by using the\nZiehl-Neelsen staining technique but removing the heating step from the\nprocedure. This new stain from Kinyoun was named the Kinyoun stain.\n\n## Procedure\n\nA typical AFB stain procedure involves dropping the cells in suspension onto a\nslide, then air drying the liquid and heat fixing the cells. The Ziehl-Neelsen\nmethod of staining for TB is known as the \u201chot plate\u201d method which means the\nZiehl-Neelsen method uses bright field microscopy. To begin the staining\nprocess, a bacterial smear must be done. The smear should be evenly spread\nacross the center of the slide. The smear is covered in a piece of bibulous\npaper and the smear is stained with carbol fuchsin. The slide is heated for\nfive minutes while keeping the bibulous paper moist with the carbol fuchsin.\nThe bibulous paper is removed and the slide is rinsed with distilled water.\nAcid-alcohol is used to decolorize the slide until the runoff is clear. The\ndecolorizer removes the stain from non-acid-fast cells. The slide is rinsed\nwith distilled water to insure all of the decolorizer is off of the slide. The\nslide is stained with the counter stain of methylene blue for one minute.\nRinse the slide with distilled water. Blot, do not rub, the slide dry in a\ntablet of bibulous paper. When the slide is dry observe the bacteria under a\nmicroscope with oil immersion. Studies have shown that an AFB stain without a\nculture has a poor negative predictive value. An AFB culture should be\nperformed along with an AFB stain; this has a much higher negative predictive\nvalue.\n\n## Mechanism explanation\n\nInitially, carbol fuchsin stains every cell. When they are de-stained with\nacid-alcohol, only non-acid-fast bacteria get de-stained since they do not\nhave a thick, waxy lipid layer like acid-fast bacteria. When counter stain is\napplied, non-acid-fast bacteria pick it up and become blue (methylene blue) or\ngreen (malachite green) when viewed under the microscope. Acid-fast bacteria\nretain carbol fuchsin so they appear red.\n\n## Modifications\n\n  * 1% sulfuric acid alcohol for actinomycetes, nocardia.\n  * 0.5\u20131% sulfuric acid alcohol for oocysts of isospora, cyclospora.\n  * 0.25\u20130.5% sulfuric acid alcohol for bacterial endospores.\n  * Differential staining \u2013 glacial acetic acid used, no heat applied, secondary stain is Loeffler's methylene blue.\n  * Kinyoun modification (or cold Ziehl\u2013Neelsen technique) is also available.\n  * A protocol in which a detergent is substituted for the highly toxic phenol in the fuchsin staining solution.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Lowenstein\u2013Jensen medium\n  * Gram stain\n  * Kinyoun stain\n  * Acid-fastness\n  * Franz Ziehl\n  * Friedrich Neelsen\n\n### Online protocol examples\n\n  * Ziehl\u2013Neelsen protocol (PDF format).\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * \"Microbiology with Diseases by Body System\", Robert W.

    "gold_doc": [
      "# Public Accounts Committee (India)\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a committee of selected members of\nparliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the purpose of\nauditing the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The check\nthat parliament exercises over the executive stems from the basic principle\nthat parliament embodies the will of the people. This committee along with the\nEstimates committee (EC) and Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) are the\nthree financial standing committees of the Parliament of India. It serves as a\ncheck on the government especially with respect to its expenditure bill and\nits primary function is to examine the audit report of Comptroller and Auditor\nGeneral (C&AG;) after it is laid in the Parliament. C&AG; assists the\ncommittee during the course of investigation. None of its members are allowed\nto be ministers in the government. The main function of the committee is to\nascertain whether the money granted by parliament has been spent by government\nwithin the scope of the demand. The Public Accounts Committee consists of not\nmore than twenty-two members, fifteen elected by Lok Sabha, the lower house of\nthe Parliament, and not more than seven members of Rajya Sabha, the upper\nhouse of the Parliament. The members are elected every year from amongst its\nmembers of respective houses according to the principle of proportional\nrepresentation by means of single transferable vote. The chairperson is\nappointed by the Lok Sabha speaker. The term of office of the members is one\nyear. At present, the 16th Lok Sabha has no designated leader of opposition,\nhowever the Indian National Congress (INC) being largest opposition party has\ngotten the responsibility of heading the PAC. The current PAC is headed by\nAdhir Ranjan Chowdhury since July, 2019 after Mallikarjun Kharge, who was\nleader of INC in the Lok Sabha. He was re-appointed to a second term in May\n2018.\n\n## History\n\nThe committee was first conceived in the year 1921 in the wake of Montagu-\nChelmsford Reforms. During the initial days of British colonial government in\nIndia, the finance member of the executive council was the chairperson of the\ncommittee. Post independence, till 1950 the chairperson of the committee was\nthe finance minister. However, in 1950, the country became republic and the\ncommittee became a parliamentary committee functioning under the control of\nthe Speaker of Lok Sabha with a non-official chairperson. From 1950 to 1967,\nthe chairperson was selected from the ruling party. Since 1967, the\nchairperson of the committee is selected from the opposition, usually the\nleader of opposition. Prior to the year 1954\u201355, the committee consisted of 15\nmembers who were elected by Lok Sabha from amongst its members. But with\neffect from the year 1954\u201355, 7 members from the Rajya Sabha have also been\nelected to the committee.\n\n## Scope and working\n\nAs stated earlier, the primary function of the PAC is to examine the audit\nreport of Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG;) after it is laid in the\nParliament. The audit by the C&AG; is comprehensive and manifold. It involves\namong others, (a) accountancy audit, (b) regularity audit, (c) appropriation\naudit, (d) discretionary audit and (e) efficiency-cum-performance audit. At\nthe beginning of its term every year, the committee makes a selection of audit\nparagraphs included in the various reports of C&AG; for in-depth examination.\nAfter holding deliberations and taking note of the time available at its\ndisposal, the committee selects the most important paragraphs from the audit\nreports for detailed examination and submits its reports to the House on them.\n\n## Current composition\n\nKeys: = 22 members\n\n### Sub-committees\n\nCurrently there are 4 sub-committees within the PAC. They are as follows.\n\n## Probes in recent years\n\nThe C&AG; report on the 2G spectrum case stated a loss of \u20b91.76 trillion\n(US$25 billion), based on 2010 3G and BWA spectrum-auction prices. The ensuing\ndifferences resulting from the then opposition party BJP's demand to set up a\njoint parliamentary committee in addition to the PAC's inquiry into the 2G\nspectrum allocation case led to a complete freeze between the government and\nopposition in the winter session of parliament of 2010. The then PM Manmohan\nSingh stated that he was willing to appear before the committee. This brought\nthe committee to the forefront of the public's attention. Some of the probes\nsince then are listed below :\n\n### 2G spectrum case (2008)\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG;) laid out in its report a seething\ninquest of the case, showing how then telecom minister A Raja and bureaucrats\nallegedly colluded to show undue favour to companies that lied or\nmisrepresented basic information in their applications for 2G licenses. The\nC&AG; report on the 2G spectrum case stated a loss of \u20b91.76 trillion (US$25\nbillion). The initial estimate of loss was 57,000 crores but was revised\nupward of 1.76 lakh crores. The committee, on 4 April 2011, summoned Ratan\nTata, chairman of the Tata group; and Niira Radia, a corporate lobbyist,\nregarding the case. The then PAC chairperson Murli Manohar Joshi asked\nCongress members to apologise to Comptroller and Auditor General of India for\nmaking allegations against it.\n\n### Commonwealth Games case (2010)\n\nThe 2010 Commonwealth Games hosted by India was subject of multiple\nallegations of corruption. The Public Accounts Committee has faulted the then\nCongress-led UPA government for taking the games management out of the\ngovernment machinery leading to a \"number of errors\" that almost resulted in\nthe \"biggest management failure\". The report was tabled in Parliament in April\n2017.\n\n### Adarsh housing case (2011)\n\nIn 2011, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG;)\nsaid, \"The episode of Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society reveals how a group\nof select officials, placed in key posts, could subvert rules and regulations\nin order to grab prime government land \u2013 a public property \u2013 for personal\nbenefit.\"\n\n### Coal block allocation case (2012)\n\nThe C&AG; in its report estimated undue benefits to the tune \u20b91.86 trillion\n(US$26 billion) to private players on account of coal blocks allocation to\nthem without resorting to auction. The essence of the C&AG;'s argument is that\nthe Government had the authority to allocate coal blocks by a process of\ncompetitive bidding, but chose not to. As a result, both public sector\nenterprises (PSEs) and private firms paid less than they might have otherwise.\n\n### VVIP Helicopter acquisition case (2013)\n\nChairperson K V Thomas said in 2016 that the PAC was willing to take up the\nVVIP case again, although PAC, when it was headed by his predecessor and\nsenior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, had examined the report of the\nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in 2013.\n\n### Demonetisation of November 8, 2016\n\nOn the eve of November 8, 2016, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi\nannounced \"Notes of and will not remain a legal tender by midnight\". Being an\nunprecedented step it was much highlighted in the national and international\nnews with a number of people criticizing the move and government acclaiming it\nas a surgical strike against black money. But then PAC head K. V. Thomas,\nmember of INC, took a serious note of the move and started probing the move\nwherein it decided to call RBI governor Urjit Patel, Finance Secretary Ashok\nLavasa and Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das. The decision was taken\nunanimously by all the members of the committee to call the bureaucratic\nofficers.\n\n## Chairpersons\n\n### Pre-independence\n\n### After independence\n\nDenotes the year 1967\u201368 from when the chairman of the PAC was member of the\nmain opposition party, usually the leader of opposition.\n\n### Longest serving chairpersons of PAC\n\n## Reports Published\n\nAs part of its oversight process the committee has published quite a number of\nreports over the course of its existence post declaration of republic in 1950.\nThe committee has published a total of 1596 reports from 1950 to April 2018.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Parliamentary Committees of India\n  * 16th Lok Sabha\n  * Lok Sabha\n\n## External links\n\n  * Lok Sabha - Public Accounts Committee Homepage\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# What Is Love\n\n\"What Is Love\" is a song recorded by Trinidadian-German Eurodance artist\nHaddaway for his debut album, The Album. The song was released on 8 May 1993\nas the album's lead single. It was a massive hit in Europe, becoming a number-\none hit in at least 13 countries and reaching number two in Germany, Sweden,\nand the United Kingdom. Outside Europe, the song was moderately successful,\nreaching number 11 in the United States, number 12 in Australia, number 17 in\nCanada, and number 48 in New Zealand.\n\n## Background\n\n\"What Is Love\" was written and produced by German music producer and composer\nDee Dee Halligan (Dieter L\u00fcnstedt a.k.a. Tony Hendrik) and Junior Torello\n(Karin Hartmann-Eisenbl\u00e4tter a.k.a. Karin van Haaren) of Coconut Records in\nCologne. They were waiting for the right singer for the song. Trinidadian-born\nsinger Nestor Alexander Haddaway was then chosen to sing it. He used to work\nas a producer, dancer and choreographer before he was signed to Coconut\nRecords. In a 2012 interview Haddaway said about the making of \"What Is Love\":\n\n## Release and legacy\n\n\"What Is Love\" was released in Europe in May 1993 and in the US in August\n1993. It peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and Germany and hit number\none in 13 other countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,\nIreland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and\nZimbabwe.

By March 1994, worldwide sales of \"What Is Love\" had already\nreached 2.6 million. When asked about the meaning of \"What Is Love\" in a 2015\ninterview, Haddaway said:\n\n## Critical reception\n\nBillboard wrote about the song: \"Glorious pop/house ditty recently topped\nEnglish pop charts, and was an international club hit almost a year ago.\nWildly catchy chorus is complemented by a slick, synth-happy arrangement.\nHaddaway will conjure up images of Seal and Sydney Youngblood with his worldly\nbaritone delivery. A sure-fire dance hit that has the muscle to push its way\nonto pop formats with ease.\" Music & Media noted that the song has \"a fast\nhouse beat augmented by Nestor Haddaway's deeply soulful vocals. This is\ndefinitely on par with anything that has come out of Chicago's deep house\nscene for quite some time.\" The Gavin Report wrote: \"Try sitting still seconds\nafter this upbeat entry kicks in. Still hot in the U.K. where it had a Top 10\nrun, Haddaway's style is reminscent of the Fine Young Cannibals and just as\nexciting.\"\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video of \"What Is Love\" was directed by German music video director\nVolker Hannwacker. It features Haddaway performing in an old castle,\nsurrounded by vampire-like dominatrices.\n\n## Accolades\n\n## In popular culture\n\n\"What is Love\" experienced a revival as the song from the Saturday Night Live\n\"Roxbury Guys\" sketches later expanded into the 1998 feature film A Night at\nthe Roxbury, where two brothers (played by Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell)\nfrequently went to dance clubs with a third person (including actors such as\nSylvester Stallone and Jim Carrey), credited as \"Barhop\".

      "# Solomon Skuza\n\nSolomon Skuza (1954\u20131995), also known as Jah Solo was a Zimbabwean musician,\none of the most popular to come out of Plumtree. In addition to his native\nKalanga, he wrote lyrics in Ndebele, Shona and English as well. Other popular\nKalanga musicians include Nduna Malaba (Ndux Malax), Ndolwane Super Sounds,\nMokis Connection and Solomon's brother Chase Skuza.\n\n## Biography\n\nBorn in 1954 in Plumtree, Solomon Skuza went into exile in Zambia during the\nRhodesian Bush War to join the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).\nSkuza played in the ZIPRA band and entertained guerrillas at ZIPRA camps. He\nlater became the band leader and an official composer for the ZIPRA\nEntertainment Corps. In 1980, Skuza returned to Zimbabwe and produced a hit\nsingle, Banolila, which sold over 75,000 copies. His 1990 album, Love and\nScandals, was a commercial and critical success, due to its political content\nregarding the Willowgate Scandal of the time. In one song, he asks, \"how can\nsomeone buy a car and sell it again?\" In another, he sings of his love leaving\nhim for \"a guy who owns a Cressida\", referring to the Toyota Cressidas\nassembled at Willowvale. It was this album that earned him the nickname \"Jah\nSolo.\" Solomon Skuza was backed by bands such as Fallen Heroes. He named the\nband \"Fallen Heroes\" to honor those who had died during the Liberation\nStruggle.He released Zihlangene Vol. 1 and Zihlangene Vol. 2 compilation\nalbums which cover his earlier and later hits, respectively. Solomon sang in\nhis native Kalanga and both Ndebele, English and Shona. In 1990 he did a\nsoundtrack, Patimile, for the Zimbabwean film Jit.\n\n## Sickness and Death\n\nSolomon was shot during the war that is why he could not dance during his\nperformances. The actual cause of Solomon Skuza's death remains unknown.\nDuring his sickness period, Solomon was taken to some traditional healers\n(known as 'inyanga') but, they could not ascertain his cause of sickness. He\nalso went to doctors who, like the nyangas, could not see anything.\nConsequently, Solomon died in 1995.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Albums\n\n  * Kudzanayi\n  * Love and Scandals\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 1\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 2\n  * Zlhlangene Vol. 3\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Solomon Skuza\", Music of Zimbabwe\n\n",
      "# Love Machine (The Miracles song)\n\n\"Love Machine\" is a 1975 single recorded by Motown group The Miracles, taken\nfrom their album City of Angels. The song was a #1 Pop smash on the Billboard\nHot 100, and the biggest-selling hit single of The Miracles' career. This\nsingle was one of two Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 hits recorded by The Miracles\nwith Billy Griffin as lead vocalist; the other is 1973's \"Do It Baby\". Griffin\nhad replaced Miracles founder Smokey Robinson as lead singer in 1972. The song\nfeatures a growling vocal by Miracle Bobby Rogers, with group baritone Ronnie\nWhite repeating \"yeah baby\" throughout the song.\n\n## Background\n\nEngineered and mixed by Kevin Beamish, \"Love Machine\" was produced by Freddie\nPerren, a former member of The Corporation brain trust in charge of the early\nJackson 5 hits. It was written by Billy Griffin and his Miracles group-mate,\noriginal Miracle Pete Moore, with whom he wrote the rest of the City of Angels\ntracks as well. The song's lyrics, delivered over a disco beat, compare a\nlover to an electronic device such as a computer or a robot. The seven-minute\nsong was split into two parts for its release as a single, with \"Part 1\"\nreceiving most notoriety. \"Love Machine\" was the only two-part single of the\nMiracles' career. \"Love Machine\" was a multi-million selling Platinum single,\nand a number-one smash hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the best-selling\nsingle of the Miracles' career, having sold over 4.5 million copies.

The success prompted her album Ride to the Rainbow to be reissued as\nLove Machine for the Japanese release. Wham! performed a cover version of\n\"Love Machine\" on their 1983 album, Fantastic. The track was recorded as a\nlast minute replacement for \"Careless Whisper\", which Wham! decided to save\nfor their second album. \"Love Machine\", to which Griffin and co-writer Miracle\nPete Moore retained publishing rights through their publishing company Grimora\nMusic (instead of Motown's music publishing company, Jobete), is the most-used\nsong in Motown history and has generated more than $15 million in revenues.\n\n## Use in media\n\n  * Pedro De Pacas sang the song in the 1978 film starring Cheech & Chong, Up in Smoke\n  * Jesse Cochran and friends sang the song in the 1988 episode of Full House, \"The Seven-Month Itch\" (Part 2)\n  * The first 30 seconds of the song was featured in a couple of Denny's restaurant television commercials in the 1980s, depicting a mother hen and her chicks dancing to this tune for their Grand Slam Breakfasts.\n  * The 1995 Disney film Heavyweights\n  * The 1997 crime film Donnie Brasco\n  * The 1998 disco film 54\n  * The 2000 film \"Coyote Ugly\", the scene of the wedding of Violet's friend (played by Melanie Lynskey).\n  * The 2002 film The New Guy.\n  * Around 2004, The Hotel Chain Travelodge started to use the song with the brand's mascot bear dancing.\n  * The movie trailer for the 2000 animated film Chicken Run\n  * The TV spot for the 2001 Pixar film Monsters, Inc.\n  * A new version of the song also appears in the 2013 Disney film, Planes.\n  * The 1999 episode of Ally McBeal, Love's Illusions.\n  * The 2001 episode of Futurama, \"I Dated a Robot\".\n  * The 2002 episode of My Wife and Kids, Jr.'s Dating Dilemma.\n  * \"Love Machine\" was the name of a sentient computer virus in the 2009 film Summer Wars\n  * In the Disney film Planes, a Mexican airplane called El Chupacabra gets attention by singing his cover of this song as a serenade to the Canadian Rochelle in the Chinese apartment.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1976\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * See The MIRACLES perform \"Love Machine\" LIVE on YouTube\n\n",
      "# I'm in Love with My Car\n\n\"I'm in Love with My Car\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released\non their fourth album A Night at the Opera in 1975. It is the album's only\nsong written entirely by drummer Roger Taylor.\n\n## History\n\nTaylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later rerecorded\nby May on his Red Special and Taylor also doubled on electric guitar in\naddition to drums. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio\nversion and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion\nof the song were a recording of Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The\nlyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose\nTriumph TR4 was evidently the \"love of his life\". The song is dedicated to\nhim, with the liner notes mentioning, \"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy\nracer to the end\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single,\nTaylor was so fond of his song that he urged Freddie Mercury (author of the\nfirst single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") to allow it to be the B-side and locked\nhimself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become\nthe cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the\nB-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the\nmain single did for Mercury simply because it was the B-side to \"Bohemian\nRhapsody\". The song was often played live during the 1977\u201381 period. Taylor\nsang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals.\nDuring the News of the World Tour, Mercury would often sing the chorus lines\nwith Taylor. The song was used in a 2004 advertisement for Jaguar. The song's\ntitle is used as a running joke in the 2018 Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody,\nstarting with an argument between Taylor (Ben Hardy) and May (Gwilym Lee) over\nthe song's lyrical content. Later in the film, EMI executive Ray Foster (Mike\nMyers) suggests to have it or \"You're My Best Friend\" released as the first\nsingle to A Night at the Opera instead of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Shortly\nafterwards, on Kenny Everett's radio show, Freddie Mercury hands the single to\nthe eponymous host, who then reads out \"I'm In Love With My Car\" rather than\nBohemian Rhapsody, which is then correctly played on air. The song was also\nfeatured in Amazon Prime's 2019 series, Good Omens.\n\n## Reception\n\nMusic writer Tom Reynolds described the song as \"seriously, one of the\ngreatest and most passionate love songs I've heard during the last thirty-plus\nyears\". AllMusic appreciated it as a \"solid, hard hitting rocker\" from Taylor.\nThey observed, \"The music lives up to the macho tone of the lyrics by matching\nup verses that swagger in a midtempo hard rock style\", regarding it as an\n\"album highlight\".\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Roger Taylor \u2013 lead and backing vocals, drums, rhythm guitar\n  * Freddie Mercury \u2013 piano, backing vocals\n  * Brian May \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\n  * John Deacon \u2013 bass guitar\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Lyrics at Queen official website\n\n",
      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet.

      "# Field goal range\n\nField goal range is the part of the field in American football where there is\na good chance that a field goal attempt will be successful. A field goal is\nnormally 17 yards (7 yards in Canadian football) longer than the distance of\nthe line of scrimmage to the goal line, as it includes the end zone (10 yards)\nand 7 yards to where the holder places the ball. In Canadian football, the\ngoal posts are on the goal lines, in front of the end zones. Therefore, if the\nline of scrimmage is at the 30, the field goal would be 47 yards (in American\nfootball) or 37 yards (in Canadian football).\n\n## Average field goal range\n\nThe exact field goal range varies for each team, depending on the ability of\nthe team's placekicker. While some weaker placekickers may have trouble\nkicking field goals longer than 30 yards (making field goals from beyond the\n13 difficult), others may consistently make 50-yarders, making it practical to\nkick from beyond the 33. For most NFL kickers, the 35-yard line is typically\nthe limit of their field goal range. Weather conditions, particularly wind,\nalso have a significant impact on field goal range; kicking with the wind at\nthe kicker's back significantly increases field goal range, while kicking\nagainst the wind or with a stiff crosswind will greatly reduce the kicker's\neffective range, while generally there is no advantage beyond assured\ntargeting of a kick if a game is being played indoors. Heavy snowfall can\ngreatly reduce field goal range, both by weighing the ball down and by making\nit more difficult to get a secure spotting of the ball or sufficient momentum\nin the run-up. Altitude also affects kicking range; both the longest punt in\nNFL history and three of the longest field goals in NFL history took place in\nDenver, Colorado, which is more than higher in elevation than the next-highest\nNFL city (the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona). From the 1970s through the\n1990s, artificial turf improved a kicker's field goal range by having less\nfriction during the kick; one of the reasons Scott Norwood missed the game-\nwinning kick in Super Bowl XXV was that he kicked on artificial turf in\nBuffalo and struggled with longer field goals on natural grass throughout his\ncareer, and Super Bowl XXV was played on a grass surface. (Modern artificial\nturf, which has similar depth and characteristics to natural grass, does not\nhave an appreciable effect on kicking range.) In high school football, players\nare permitted to kick off special flat kicking tees up to two inches high. The\nNCAA banned the use of kicking tees in 1989. Most of the longer-range field\ngoals in NCAA history were kicked prior to the elimination of tees; the use of\ntees allowed the ball to be elevated out of the field's grass or turf,\nreducing friction in the opening milliseconds of the kick and allowing for\nlonger kicks.\n\n## Kicking versus punting\n\nIf a kicker is outside of field goal range, teams will generally punt.\nHowever, punting too close to the end zone increases the risk of a touchback,\nwhich nullifies most of the effect of the punt. Thus, teams who face a fourth\ndown between the 35 and 40 yard lines (closer in a crosswind) often will go\nfor the more risky fourth down conversion rather than risk either the\ntouchback or the missed field goal.\n\n## Record holders\n\nThe longest field goal in recorded football history was 69 yards, set by\ncollegiate kicker Ove Johansson, who was born in Sweden, in a 1976 Abilene\nChristian University football game against East Texas State University (now\nTexas A&M; Commerce) at Shotwell Stadium in Abilene. The longest successful\nfield goal in the NFL was 64 yards and was completed by Matt Prater in 2013.\nThe NCAA record is 67 yards held by 3 kickers, Russell Erxleben of Texas,\nSteve Little of Arkansas and Joe Williams of Wichita State University. All\nthree of those kickers achieved that feat in the 1977-1978 college seasons.\nNotably, Johansson, Erxleben and Little all failed dramatically when they\nentered the NFL-- Johansson's failure was due to an injury, but the other two\nwere first-round draft busts. The CFL record is 62 yards held by Paul\nMcCallum, the NFL preseason record 65 yards held by Ola Kimrin, the\nindependent amateur record (as well as the record without the aid of a tee;\ntees are not allowed in the NFL and have been banned from NCAA since 1989) is\n68 yards held by Fabrizio Scaccia, and the high school record 68 yards held by\nDirk Borgognone; high school has wider goal posts and treats a field goal\nattempt that lands short in the field of play the same as a punt, making\nlonger attempts much less risky. The indoor football record, with narrower and\nhigher goal posts, is 63 yards (set by Aaron Mills), which is practically as\nlong of a field goal as is possible in that variant of the sport, since the\nfield in indoor football (including both end zones) is only 66 yards. Scaccia,\nwhile playing indoor football, attempted a 64-yard kick that was inches short\nof success, hitting the crossbar. Longer field goals have been attempted at\ntimes; the longest attempt in the NFL, which was well short and was kicked\ninto the wind, was 76 yards, attempted by Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland\nRaiders, in a September 28, 2008 game against the San Diego Chargers. NFL\nEurope rewarded kickers that successfully kicked a field goal of longer than\n50 yards with a bonus point, making such field goals worth 4 points instead of\n3; this rule has since been adopted by the Stars Football League. The shortest\npossible field goal under current strategies is slightly over 17 yards in\nAmerican football and 8 yards in Canadian football (Canadian football requires\nthe ball to be snapped at least one yard away from the end zone).\nTheoretically, a field goal could be attempted from a shorter distance as long\nas the holder stays behind the line of scrimmage (or via a drop kick at any\npoint on the field), but in practice this has never happened.\n\n## Drop kicks\n\nIt has been surmised that a drop kick has a slightly longer range than the\nstandard place kick, but since these kicks are so rare, that is not known for\nsure. During the early NFL era, this was generally true, and drop kicks were\nthe norm for longer field goals; in fact, the first unofficial NFL record kick\nof 55 yards, set by Paddy Driscoll in 1924, was indeed set by drop kick. The\nfootball was shaped differently in that era, being changed to its modern, more\nnarrow shape in 1935, so it is not reasonable to compare field goals from that\nera with the modern era, any more than it is reasonable to compare a kick with\na rugby ball with an American football today. The only successful drop kick in\nthe NFL since the 1941 NFL Championship Game was by Doug Flutie, the backup\nquarterback of the New England Patriots, against the Miami Dolphins on January\n1, 2006, for an extra point after a touchdown. Flutie had estimated \"an 80\npercent chance\" of making the drop kick, which was called to give Flutie, 43\nat the time, the opportunity to make a historic kick in his final NFL game,\nthe drop kick being his last play in the NFL. After the game, New England\ncoach Bill Belichick said, \"I think Doug deserves it,\" and Flutie said, \"I\njust thanked him for the opportunity.\" The kick was executed from 27 yards out\n(Flutie stood in a punter position, 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage).\nDrew Brees, a former teammate of Flutie's, attempted a drop-kicked extra point\nfrom the same position during the poorly received 2012 Pro Bowl; his kick,\nhowever, fell short.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Video of Johannson's 69 yard kick for Abilene Christian in 1976\n\n"

      "# List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career 3-point scoring leaders\n\nA three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a\nfield goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a\ndesignated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three\npoints, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-\npoint line. The members on this list are the top 25 in 3-point field goals\nmade in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I\ncompetition. The statistic was first recognized in the 1986\u201387 season when\n3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA. From the 1986\u201387\nseason through the 2007\u201308 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for\nboth men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's\nbasketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the\nmen's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original\ndistance until it was moved to match the then-current men's distance effective\nin 2011\u201312. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend\nthe men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019\u201320 in\nDivision I and 2020\u201321 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remains at 20\nft 9 in. The all-time leader in three-point field goals made is Fletcher Magee\nof Wofford. In his four-year career from 2015 to 2019, he made 509 threes in\n1,169 attempts (43.5%). The career record for three-point attempts is held by\nTravis Bader of Oakland, who had held the record for made threes before Magee\nbroke it in the first round of the 2019 NCAA tournament. Bader attempted 1,246\nthrees in his career, making 504. Only one player in the top 25 all-time\nearned his way onto this list in only three seasons: Stephen Curry of Davidson\nplayed from 2006\u201307 through 2008\u201309 but left for the National Basketball\nAssociation (NBA) after his junior season. Curry also played in the fewest\ngames (104) out of all of the other players in the top 25 and currently ranks\n12th all-time. Four players split their collegiate careers at two schools\napiece: Keith Veney, who made 409 threes, first played at Lamar before\ntransferring to Marshall; Akeem Richmond, who made 416, started at Rhode\nIsland before transferring to East Carolina; Rotnei Clarke, who made 389,\nplayed three seasons at Arkansas before transferring to Butler for his final\nseason; and Andrew Rowsey, who made 404 while playing two seasons apiece at\nUNC Asheville and Marquette. The player with the highest three-point\npercentage for his career on this list is Magee at 43.5%, while Joe Zeglinski\nof Hartford has the lowest (34.5%).\n\n## Key\n\n## Top 25 3-point field goal leaders\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# Hitting streak\n\nIn baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in\nwhich a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According to the\nOfficial Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarily ended when a player\nhas at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated\nif all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch,\ndefensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the\nplayer has a sacrifice fly and no hit. Joe DiMaggio holds the Major League\nBaseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on\nMay 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak (91-for-223),\nwith 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in.\n\n## Major League Baseball records\n\nThere have been 55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a\nhitting streak of at least 30 games. Multiple streaks in the same season have\noccurred in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and\nBenito Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar, Jr.), 1999\n(Vladimir Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras),\nand 2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole\nstreak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar\nevent occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the end\nof another (Jimmy Rollins). Keeler's streak started in his final game of the\n1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season.\nRollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through\nthe first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of\n1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball recognizes two\nhitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest\nhitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005\u20132006). Keeler's,\nSisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when\ndiscussing single-season streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing\nmultiple-season streaks. This list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American\nAssociation Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887,\nthe major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which\nwas dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season,\nbut his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only \"hits\" were\nwalks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so\nLyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists.\nIn 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the\nstatistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand,\neven in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the\nruling affects only hit totals for the year; the batting champion for the year\nis not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-\nseason average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.\nTy Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple\nstreaks of 30 games or longer. There have been 129 single-season streaks of 25\ngames or more. The lowest batting average ever recorded during a hitting\nstreak of 25 games or more was .304 by Bruce Campbell in 1938. The highest was\n.486 during Chuck Klein's streak in 1930. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his\nrecord-holding 56 game streak. In probability theory, every baseball game is a\nBernoulli trial in which a hitter either does or does not get a hit.\nDiMaggio's streak of 56 consecutive games with hits awaits an equal streak:\n\"The probability is .0003 that a .350 hitter will have a hitting streak of at\nleast 56 games in a season. If there are about 4 such seasons per year in the\nfuture, we would expect to see such a streak, assuming the Bernoulli trials\nmodel, every 1/(.0003 x 4) = 833 years.\"\n\n## Major League Baseball records by franchise\n\nOnly currently extant franchises are included on this list. Where a player had\na significant streak while the team was in other than its current city, the\nrecords in these other cities are displayed. As above, for a multi-year\nstreak, the single-season streak is shown in parentheses.\n\n## Minor League Baseball records\n\nThe longest streaks in the history of Minor League Baseball and other\nprofessional baseball leagues: DiMaggio set the Minor League record as a\nmember of the San Francisco Seals. Unrecognized by Minor League Baseball is\nthe 69 game hitting streak by Joe Wilhoit in 1919. Wilhoit was in the\nindependent Western League at the time and his record is considered the all-\ntime Professional Baseball record.\n\n## College Baseball records\n\n## College Softball records\n\n## See also\n\n  * Batting (baseball)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Major League Baseball hitting streaks at mlb.com\n\n",
      "# List of players with five or more goals in an NHL game\n\nThis is a list of players who have scored five or more goals in a National\nHockey League (NHL) game. Scoring five or more goals in a single game is\nconsidered a great feat, as it has only been accomplished 61 times, by 45\nplayers, in the history of the league. The first player to do so was Joe\nMalone, with the Montreal Canadiens, in the first ever NHL game, on December\n19, 1917. The most recent player to do so was Patrik Laine, with the Winnipeg\nJets, in the 101st NHL season of play, on November 24, 2018. In addition to\nbeing first, Joe Malone holds the overall record with five different five-or-\nmore goal games, including the NHL record seven goals in a game, as well as a\nsix-goal game and three five-goal games - all in the first three seasons of\nthe NHL\u2019s existence. He is also the only player to record a five-goal game\nwith more than one team, accomplishing his first three with the Montreal\nCanadiens and his last two with the Quebec Bulldogs. Overall, seven different\nplayers have scored six goals in a game--including brothers Corb and Cy\nDenneny, with different teams, within a few weeks of each other in 1921. A\ntotal of 40 individual players have scored exactly five goals in a game, on\none or more occasions. While five-goal games continue to occur from time to\ntime, no player has scored six or more goals since Darryl Sittler scored six\nin February 1976. Only eight players have multiple five-goal games. Next to\nMalone achieving the mark five different times, both Wayne Gretzky and Mario\nLemieux attained the feat four times, Newsy Lalonde did it three times, while\nfour other players have had two five-goal games. Of the eight players with\nmultiple five-goal games, only two have achieved the multiple in a single\nseason: Malone (3 times in 1917\u201318, twice in 1919\u201320) and Sittler (twice in\n1975\u201376). Gretzky (early and late 1981) and Maurice Richard (early and late\n1944) had two five-goal games in the same calendar year, across two NHL\nseasons. Ian Turnbull is the only defenseman who has scored five goals in a\ngame, doing so in February 1977. Mario Lemieux is the only player in history\nto achieve a five-goal game by scoring in five different ways - in December\n1988, he scored an even-strength goal, a power-play goal, a short-handed goal,\na penalty shot goal and an empty net goal. Wayne Gretzky\u2019s second five-goal\ngame, in December 1981, also marked his achievement of the NHL\u2019s fastest ever\n50 goals in 50 games, when he scored five goals in his 39th game of the\nseason. Of the 61 different five-goal games, five instances were achieved in a\nplayoff game. The Montreal Canadiens have had the highest number of players,\n9, and the highest number of occurrences, 14, of a five-goal game. The Toronto\nSt. Patricks/Toronto Maple Leafs are second in both categories, with 7\ndifferent players scoring a five-goal game, on 9 different occasions.\n\n## Scorers\n\nLegend\n\n## Players who scored five or more goals in multiple games\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# ISS year-long mission\n\nThe One-Year Mission was a scientific research project aboard the\nInternational Space Station, which studied the health effects of long-term\nspaceflight. Scott Kelly and Mikhail Korniyenko spent 342 days in space, with\nscientists performing medical experiments. Kelly and Kornienko launched on 27\nMarch 2015 on Soyuz TMA-16M along with Gennady Padalka. The mission\nencompassed Expeditions 43, 44, 45 and 46. The pair safely landed in\nKazakhstan on March 2, 2016, returning aboard Soyuz TMA-18M with Sergey\nVolkov. The mission supported the NASA Twins study, which helps shed light on\nthe health effects of long duration spaceflight, which is of interest for Mars\nmissions especially. On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results, from the\nNASA Twins study, which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including\nthose related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared\nwith the other.\n\n## History\n\nIn November 2012, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), and\ntheir international partners selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year\nmission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. The mission included\ncollecting scientific data important to future human exploration of the Solar\nSystem. Kelly and Korniyenko already had a connection; Kelly was a backup crew\nmember for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Korniyenko served as a\nflight engineer. The goal aboard the orbiting laboratory was to understand\nbetter how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space.\nData from the mission was intended to help inform current assessments of crew\nperformance and health and determine better and validate countermeasures to\nreduce the risks associated with future exploration as NASA plans for missions\naround the Moon, asteroids and ultimately Mars.\n\n## Health studies\n\nThe International Space Station developed exercise equipment, including\ntreadmills and resistance devices to limit muscle atrophy in a low gravity\nenvironment. Weightlessness causes body fluids in astronauts to accumulate in\nthe upper half of the body, leading to facial edema and unwelcome side\neffects. One problem may be the low gravity affecting the body in unforeseen\nways and it can be hard detect the cause and effect of gravity on the body.\nSpace seems to cause trouble for a number of body parts including bone,\nsometimes the eyes, and a classic problem is space sickness.\n\n### Psychological studies\n\nThe study also required the astronauts to keep a journal, and investigated the\npsychological effects of living in a confined space for an extended length of\ntime. Kornienko said of his experiences on Expedition 23/24: \"The thing you\nmiss there most of all is the Earth itself, I missed smells. I missed trees, I\neven dreamt of them. I even hallucinated. I thought I smelled a real fire and\nsomething being barbecued on it! I ended up putting pictures of trees on the\nwalls to cheer up. You do miss the Earth there.\" Scott stated that he missed\nfeeling changes in the weather while on the ISS.\n\n## History\n\nVladimir Titov and Musa Manarov spent 365 days in space on Mir from December\n1987 to December 1988. Sergei Avdeyev spent 379 days on Mir in 1999 and Valeri\nPolyakov spent 437 days on Mir in 1994-1995.

      "# Sign of the Times (Harry Styles song)\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" is the debut single by English singer-songwriter Harry\nStyles from his self-titled debut studio album. Released on 7 April 2017 by\nColumbia Records, it was written by Styles, Jeff Bhasker, Mitch Rowland, Ryan\nNasci, Alex Salibian, and Tyler Johnson, and produced by Bhasker, Salibian,\nand Johnson. Musically, it was described by critics as a pop rock and soft\nrock ballad. Its accompanying music video was released on 8 May.\n\n## Background and release\n\nRumours about Styles embarking on a solo career sparked in 2015, when it was\nreported that Sony Music wanted Styles to release a solo album during . By the\nend of 2015, four new songs written and performed by Styles were registered on\nthe ASCAP online database, which was believed to be for his potential debut\nsolo album at the time. Shortly after, Styles signed with American agent\nJeffrey Azoff and inked a record contract with Columbia Records. In September\n2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man, which led to media\nspeculation about a new album on the horizon. In February 2017, the CEO of\nColumbia Records, Rob Stringer, revealed that the album was close to being\nfinished and called it \"authentic\". A month later, it was reported that the\nalbum sounded like David Bowie and Queen, and was later revealed to have been\nexecutively produced by Grammy award-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye\nWest, Fun, Mark Ronson). The same report also hinted that the lead single\nwould be released in late April or early May and sounded \"like it would be a\nsmash in any decade\". The same month, US radio host Elvis Duran accidentally\nrevealed during his show that Styles' debut single would be released on 7\nApril 2017. On 25 March, Styles teased the new single with a television ad\nduring The Voice UK. On 31 March, the singer revealed through social media\nthat his single is titled \"Sign of the Times\". On 7 April, the song premiered\nduring Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show on BBC Radio 1.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe song is a pop rock, soft rock, piano ballad, with glam rock influences.\nAccording to Billboard, it \"folds in psychedelic soul, indie rock and spacey\npop\". The \"apocalyptic\" power ballad shows influences from 70s British rock.\nThe track was co-written by Jeff Bhasker, Alex Salibian and Tyler Johnson.\nAlso credited were Mitch Rowland, Ryan Nasci, and Styles (who received the top\ncredit). Rowland played guitar and drums, Nasci the bass, and Bhasker the\npiano, keyboard and lap steel parts. A 25 voice choir provided harmonies\nthroughout the song. The track was recorded at Village Studios in Los Angeles\nand Geejam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and was mixed by\nSpike Stent. \"Sign of the Times\" is composed in the key of F major and set in\na 4/4 time signature at a moderately slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. The\nidea of the song was conceived by Styles while playing chords on the piano in\nJamaica. Styles explained to Rolling Stone that \"The song is written from a\npoint of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there's a\ncomplication. The mother is told, 'The child is fine, but you're not going to\nmake it.' The mother has five minutes to tell the child, 'Go forth and\nconquer.'\" The entire song was cut in three hours according to Bhasker, who\ncalled it \"an instant classic-sounding record from conception to completion\".\n\n## Music video\n\nDirected by Yoann Lemoine, the song's music video was released on 8 May 2017.\nIt features Styles singing in a meadow, flying in the skies, and walking on\nwater. A writer from USA Today humorously described Styles as \"auditioning to\nbe Marvel Comics next superhero or in a new biblical epic\". It was filmed on\nthe Isle of Skye in Scotland. The video's stunt pilot, Will Banks, stated that\nStyles flew more than 1,550 feet high during the shoot. Banks also claimed\nthat no green screen or CGI effects were employed during filming. A stunt\ndouble was used for some scenes. The music video won British Artist Video of\nthe Year at the 2018 Brit Awards and Best Music Video at the 2018 iHeartRadio\nMusic Awards. It was nominated for two awards at the 2017 MTV Video Music\nAwards: Best Pop Video and Best Visual Effects. , it has received more than\n510 million views on YouTube.\n\n## Accolades\n\n## Critical reception\n\nBillboards Gil Kaufman wrote, \"Every artist is an accumulation of their\ninfluences, and in [this song] they come fast and furious, as Styles appears\nto be both showing his range and making a clear effort to step boldly away\nfrom the manufactured, plastic pop of his past\". Kaufman opined it \"rakes in\ninfluences from Pink Floyd and David Bowie to Queen, Spacehog, Suede,\nColdplay, The Beatles, Eric Carmen and Prince\". Also for Billboard, Jason\nLipshutz wrote it is \"resolute, determined, wholly committed to its messaging\nand sound, radio trends be damned. Although it wears its influences on its\nsleeve (Bowie) nothing about this single bends toward someone else's\nexpectations\". He concluded saying the song \"sounds effortless, but to arrive\nwithout any incomplete features is an accomplishment in a music industry where\npop artists are expected to produce new music at an unsustainable rate\". Tim\nJonze of The Guardian described it as \"a ballad, but not so much in the\nboyband style\" and compared the song to the music of American indie rock band\nThe Walkmen. Jonze also addressed early rumours that the song would be\ninfluenced by the music of David Bowie, noting, \"If it is indeed Bowie-esque,\nthen it's the Bowie of Hunky Dory\". Jamieson Cox writing for Pitchfork felt\nthe \"sky-scraping Bowie ballad\" manages to sound like both Fun's \"We Are\nYoung\" and Coldplay's \"The Scientist\". NPR's Ann Powers argued the song\nmirrors more closely \"Britpop anthems\" like Blur's \"Tender\" or The Verve's\n\"Bittersweet Symphony\" \"than anything Bowie released in his prime\". Brittany\nSpanos of Rolling Stone thought it \"aligns much more with the Seventies-\ninspired pop-rock of One Direction's more recent albums like Made in the\nA.M.\". Anjali Raguraman from The Straits Times considered it the \"strongest\"\ntrack on the album, saying \"the conviction of his delivery is beyond his\nyears\". In The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber opined that the song \"continues\nwith One Direction's po-mo project of recycling classic-rock sounds as\nbubblegum. But he's now embracing such sounds with more abandon, less\nchirpiness, some trend bucking, and the kind of uplifting lyrics that nod to\nplanetary anxiety\". Kornhaber described the song opens with ballad piano,\n\"encroaching\" violins, and Styles \"crooning in pain\", \"but then there's the\nbwang of a guitar and the song rockets into an arena-rock reverie that feels\nso, so familiar to anyone who remembers the '90s but also so, so foreign to\ntoday's landscape\". Since it was released on the 30th anniversary of Prince's\nSign o' the Times, Spins Andy Cush commented, \"it's clear that this is\nStyles's attempt to distinguish himself as an artist with real depth. But the\nmusic itself has almost nothing to do with Prince\u2013instead, think Oasis, Elton\nJohn at his most bombastic, '70s John Lennon\". Cush noted it \"has only those\nthree chords, and it goes straight for cruising altitude with an onslaught of\ncymbals and guitar on the first chorus, expecting you to be moved without\npausing to consider why\". Billboards critics' list placed it first on \"Every\nOne Direction Solo Single, Ranked\" in May 2017, stating that \"[the song]\nspends six minutes climbing its way skyward and just keeps going once it gets\nthere, not ostentatious so much as naturally weightless, the first One\nDirection solo single to truly achieve escape velocity from the group's\ngravitational pull.\" Rolling Stone ranked it as the best song released in\n2017. Billboard staff considered it the 8th best song of the year and best\nrock song of the year. Pitchfork ranked it as the 87th best song of 2017. Spin\nstaff ranked it as the 13th best boy-band solo debut single. In 2018, Rolling\nStone ranked it 49th among the 100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Far.\n\n## Commercial performance\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with a combined\nsales of 62,900 units. In its first week, it recorded 39,000 digital downloads\ncombined with 3.5 million streams that give 23,472 equivalent units, ending Ed\nSheeran's run of 13 consecutive weeks at the top of the chart with \"Shape of\nYou\". In the United States, the song debuted at number four on the Billboard\nHot 100. In its first week, it sold 142,000 copies (topping Digital Songs),\nearned 16.5 million streams and 23 million airplay impressions. It managed to\nhit the number one in record time on the US iTunes charts, reaching the top in\n19 minutes, beating Adele's previous record at 50 minutes. It was certified\nplatinum in the country, making it the top certified rock song of 2017,\naccording to RIAA. It ranked number nine on the Most Shazamed Songs of 2017.\n\"Sign of the Times\" managed to be on the Shazam's Hall of Fame, the most\nShazamed songs of all time at 100th.\n\n## Cover versions and usage in media\n\nKygo and Ellie Goulding performed a cover of the song on BBC Radio 1's Live\nLounge. Hanson performed a cover on KIIS 106.5. Paul Cardall made a classical\ncover of the song. Alex Boy\u00e9 released an 'Africanized' orchestral cover.\nSabrina Carpenter collaborated with YouTube star Jasmine Thompson on a cover.\nLANY released their recordings for Spotify's new Singles series which included\na cover of \"Sign of the Times\". \"Sign of the Times\" was used for a commercial\nad for Google released in December 2017 in the United States, under the title\nof Google: Year In Search 2017. It was also used as a soundtrack for an\nepisode in the second season of the popular CW drama Riverdale. It was one of\nthe early Olympics Brand Synchs for 2018, airing throughout Europe, Asia, the\nU.S, parts of Africa spanning the globe.\n\n## Live performances\n\nStyles performed the song for the first time on the 15 April 2017 episode of\nSaturday Night Lives 42nd season.

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz.

There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Afire Love\n\n\"Afire Love\" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran for\nhis second studio album, \u00d7 (2014). The song is about Sheeran's late\ngrandfather who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The record, which was\nproduced by Snow Patrol member Johnny McDaid, samples elements of \"Remembering\nJenny\" composed by Christophe Beck for the soundtrack to the American\ntelevision series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The song was released as an\n\"instant grat\" digital download to the iTunes Store on 16 June 2014, serving\nas the third of seven promotional singles from \u00d7. Due to high streaming rates,\nall of the album's 12 tracks including \"Afire Love\" charted in the United\nKingdom.\n\n## Background and composition\n\nThe song is about Sheeran's late grandfather who suffered from Alzheimer's\ndisease for 20 years. He died of the disease in December 2013, two weeks after\nSheeran began writing about it. Sheeran finished writing the song at his\ngrandfather's funeral. Prior to the release of the album, Sheeran had also\npaid tribute at the 2014 Grammy Awards, in which he wore a necktie belonging\nto his grandfather. The lyrics discusses Sheeran's reaction to the disease as\na child all the way up until his grandfather's funeral. In the verses prior to\nthe first chorus, Sheeran recounts the circumstances present upon his\ngrandfather's disease. For instance, he sings the moment when his grandfather\nlost his capability of recognizing the face of his grandson: \"My father told\nme, son/ It's not his fault he doesn't know your face/ And you're not the only\none.\" The chorus tells the \"powerful love between his grandparents\", in which\nhis grandfather said to his grandmother: \"Put your open lips on mine and\nslowly let them shut/ For they're designed to be together/ With your body next\nto mine, our hearts will beat as one/ And we're set alight, we're afire in\nlove.\" The song concludes with Sheeran and his family seemingly singing\n\"hallelujah\" at the funeral. Sheeran recorded \"Afire Love\" in Cocoloco studio\nin Los Angeles, and Sphere and Metropolis studios in London. It was produced\nby Snow Patrol member Johnny McDaid, and engineered by Mcdaid and Geoff Swan.\nThe track samples elements of \"Remembering Jenny\", which was composed by\nChristophe Beck for the soundtrack to the American television series Buffy the\nVampire Slayer. The ballad is piano-driven and has a \"grooving\" beat.\n\n## Release and reception\n\nThe song was released as an \"instant grat\" digital download to the iTunes\nStore on 16 June 2014, serving as the third of seven promotional singles from\nhis second studio album, \u00d7 (2014).

      "# Solomon Skuza\n\nSolomon Skuza (1954\u20131995), also known as Jah Solo was a Zimbabwean musician,\none of the most popular to come out of Plumtree. In addition to his native\nKalanga, he wrote lyrics in Ndebele, Shona and English as well. Other popular\nKalanga musicians include Nduna Malaba (Ndux Malax), Ndolwane Super Sounds,\nMokis Connection and Solomon's brother Chase Skuza.\n\n## Biography\n\nBorn in 1954 in Plumtree, Solomon Skuza went into exile in Zambia during the\nRhodesian Bush War to join the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).\nSkuza played in the ZIPRA band and entertained guerrillas at ZIPRA camps. He\nlater became the band leader and an official composer for the ZIPRA\nEntertainment Corps. In 1980, Skuza returned to Zimbabwe and produced a hit\nsingle, Banolila, which sold over 75,000 copies. His 1990 album, Love and\nScandals, was a commercial and critical success, due to its political content\nregarding the Willowgate Scandal of the time. In one song, he asks, \"how can\nsomeone buy a car and sell it again?\" In another, he sings of his love leaving\nhim for \"a guy who owns a Cressida\", referring to the Toyota Cressidas\nassembled at Willowvale. It was this album that earned him the nickname \"Jah\nSolo.\" Solomon Skuza was backed by bands such as Fallen Heroes. He named the\nband \"Fallen Heroes\" to honor those who had died during the Liberation\nStruggle.He released Zihlangene Vol. 1 and Zihlangene Vol. 2 compilation\nalbums which cover his earlier and later hits, respectively. Solomon sang in\nhis native Kalanga and both Ndebele, English and Shona. In 1990 he did a\nsoundtrack, Patimile, for the Zimbabwean film Jit.\n\n## Sickness and Death\n\nSolomon was shot during the war that is why he could not dance during his\nperformances. The actual cause of Solomon Skuza's death remains unknown.\nDuring his sickness period, Solomon was taken to some traditional healers\n(known as 'inyanga') but, they could not ascertain his cause of sickness. He\nalso went to doctors who, like the nyangas, could not see anything.\nConsequently, Solomon died in 1995.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Albums\n\n  * Kudzanayi\n  * Love and Scandals\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 1\n  * Zihlangene Vol. 2\n  * Zlhlangene Vol. 3\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Solomon Skuza\", Music of Zimbabwe\n\n"

      "# Ross Bagdasarian Jr.\n\nRoss Dickran Bagdasarian (born May 6, 1949) is an American actor, animator,\nvoice actor, singer, and record producer, best known for his work on the Alvin\nand the Chipmunks franchise. He is the son of the franchise's creator, Ross\nBagdasarian. He is often called Ross Bagdasarian Jr. to distinguish himself\nfrom his father, but he does not share his father's name; the elder\nBagdasarian's given name was Rostom.\n\n## Early life\n\nBagdasarian was born in Fresno, California, the son of Armenuhi (n\u00e9e\nKulhanjian) and Ross Bagdasarian Sr. He is of Armenian descent. As a child, he\nworked with his father on The Alvin Show by helping edit and coordinate the\nsoundtracks and falsetto voice-overs of The Chipmunks.\n\n## Career\n\nBagdasarian went to law school but after his father's death in 1972, succeeded\nhim as the President of Bagdasarian Productions, which had fallen into\nobscurity after significant success between 1958 and the late 1960s. His wife\nJanice Karman, whom he married in 1979, is co-president. Bagdasarian and\nKarman have two children and live in Montecito, California. Under\nBagdasarian's supervision, new Chipmunks records were created shortly after\nhis marriage to Karman, including Chipmunk Punk. In 1981, the Chipmunks\nreturned to television in the cartoon special A Chipmunk Christmas. Two years\nlater, Ruby-Spears Productions' Alvin and the Chipmunks Saturday morning\ncartoon series debuted on NBC. Based on that series, a feature film, The\nChipmunk Adventure was released in 1987. Bagdasarian voices Alvin, Simon, and\nDave Seville, and Karman voices Theodore and The Chipettes (Brittany,\nJeanette, and Eleanor). Bagdasarian and Karman hold tight creative and\nfinancial control over the Chipmunk franchise, reviewing each and every\nbusiness contract in great detail. In the mid-90s, Bagdasarian bought the\nChipmunk rights from brother Adam and sister Carol (a stay-at-home mother), to\ntake complete control.\n\n### Universal Pictures lawsuit\n\nBagdasarian licensed the rights to the Chipmunk characters to Universal\nPictures in 1996, resulting in a string of Universal-produced direct-to-video\nfilms. Four years later, he and Karman sued them for breach of contract,\nclaiming that Universal failed to properly utilize, market, and merchandise\nthe characters and hence resulting in a loss of royalties to Bagdasarian. The\ncase was decided in Bagdasarian's favor. \"For us, it was a custody battle\",\nKarman said. \"They finally realized 'OK, these two are really fighting for\ntheir kids'.\"\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n### Television\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * History at Chipmunks.com\n\n",

      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Sway (Rolling Stones song)\n\n\"Sway\" is a song by English rock band the Rolling Stones from their 1971 album\nSticky Fingers. It was also released as the b-side of the \"Wild Horses\" single\nin June 1971. This single was released in the US only. Initial pressings of\nthe single contain an alternate take; later pressings include the album\nversion instead.\n\n## Background\n\nCredited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \"Sway\" is a slower blues song and\nwas the first song recorded by the band at Stargroves. The song features a\nbottleneck slide guitar solo during the bridge and a dramatic, virtuoso outro\nsolo (both performed by Mick Taylor). Rhythm guitar performed by Jagger was\nhis first electric guitar performance on an album. The strings on the piece\nwere arranged by Paul Buckmaster, who also worked on \"Moonlight Mile\", another\nsong from Sticky Fingers. Richards added his backing vocals but provided no\nguitar to the track. Pete Townshend, Billy Nichols and Ronnie Lane are\nbelieved to contribute backing vocals as well. Taylor would later claim that\nhe felt he deserved writing credits on Sway and a few other songs, and the\nfact that he did not receive them was one of the causes of his departure from\nthe band.\n\n## Live\n\nIt was performed live for the first time in Columbus, Ohio, and then at many\nof the shows on the band's A Bigger Bang Tour in 2006. A seven-minute version\nof \"Sway\" appears on the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor Live at the Roxy album (also\nknown as Too Hot for Snakes). Taylor gets to stretch out and solo whereas the\nStones version faded at just under four minutes. Ian McLagan plays piano on\nthis version. During the Stones' \"50 & Counting\" concert tour in 2013, the\nband, accompanied by their guest Mick Taylor, played \"Sway\" during concerts at\nLos Angeles, Chicago and Boston. These concerts marked the first time that\nTaylor played on \"Sway\" at a Stones concert.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Mick Jaggerlead vocals, rhythm guitar\n  * Keith Richardsbacking vocals\n  * Mick Taylorlead guitar, slide guitar\n  * Bill Wymanbass guitar\n  * Charlie Wattsdrums\n  * Paul Buckmasterstring arrangement\n  * Nicky Hopkinspiano\n\n## Cover versions\n\nThe song was covered by the band Overwhelming Colorfast on the 1996\ncompilation album . It was also covered by Alvin Youngblood Hart on the\nOctober 1997 River North Records release, Paint It Blue: Songs Of The Rolling\nStones. Albert Castiglia covered the track on his 2014 album, Solid Ground.\nCarla Olson and Mick Taylor recorded a live version for their album Live: Too\nHot for Snakes.\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# List of Boston Red Sox no-hitters\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Boston,\nMassachusetts, also known in their early years as the \"Boston Americans\"\n(1901\u201307). They play in the American League East division. Pitchers for the\nRed Sox have thrown 18 no-hitters in franchise history. A no-hitter is\nofficially recognized by Major League Baseball \"when a pitcher (or pitchers)\nallows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least\nnine innings. In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, an error,\na hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher's\ninterference.\" (No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously\nrecognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in\n1991 changed the rule to its current form.) A no-hitter is rare enough that\none team in Major League Baseball, the San Diego Padres, has never had a\npitcher accomplish the feat. The New York Mets' first no-hitter (pitched by\nJohan Santana) came on June 1, 2012, in the team's 8,021st game and 51st\nseason. One perfect game, a special subcategory of no-hitter, has been pitched\nin Red Sox history. As defined by Major League Baseball, \"in a perfect game,\nno batter reaches any base during the course of the game.\" Every opposing\nbatter is retired. This feat was achieved by Cy Young in 1904. Young's perfect\ngame, pitched on May 5, 1904, also was the first no-hitter in Red Sox history;\nthe most recent Red Sox no-hitter was thrown by Jon Lester on May 19, 2008.\nTwo pitchers have thrown more than one no-hitter in a Red Sox uniform, Hall of\nFamer Cy Young and Dutch Leonard. Thirteen of the Red Sox no-hitters were\nthrown at home (the first four at the Huntington Avenue Grounds and the other\nnine at Fenway Park) and five on the road. Two were thrown in April, two in\nMay, five in June, two in July, three in August, and four in September. The\nlongest interval between Red Sox no-hitters was 35 years, 6 months, and 18\ndays, between the games pitched by Dave Morehead, on September 16, 1965 and\nHideo Nomo, on April 4, 2001. The shortest interval between Red Sox no-hitters\nwas merely 1 month and 6 days, between the games pitched by Earl Wilson on\nJune 26, 1962 and Bill Monbouquette on August 1, 1962. The Red Sox have no-hit\nthe Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles (formerly the \"St. Louis Browns\")\nthe most: four times each. The White Sox were no-hit by Jesse Tannehill in\n1904, Bill Dinneen in 1905, Parnell in 1956, and Monbouquette in 1962. The\nBrowns and Orioles were no-hit by Smokey Joe Wood in 1911, Leonard in 1916,\nHideo Nomo in 2001, and Clay Buchholz in 2007. The Red Sox have won all of\ntheir no-hitters (three times in major league history a team has thrown a\nnine-inning no-hitter and lost the game). The most baserunners allowed in a\nRed Sox no-hitter was five, by Dutch Leonard in 1918. Of the 18 Red Sox no-\nhitters, four have been won by a score of 4\u20130 and another four by a score of\n2\u20130, making those final scores more common than any other results. The largest\nmargin of victory in a Red Sox no-hitter was 10\u20130, in wins by Derek Lowe in\n2002 and Clay Buchholz in 2007. The smallest margin of victory was 1\u20130,\nMonbouquette's no-hitter in 1962. 12 different managers have led the team\nduring the franchise's 18 no-hitters. 15 different home plate umpires presided\nover the franchise's 18 no-hitters. Jason Varitek has caught the last 4 of the\nRed Sox's No-hitters, a Major League record for No-hitters caught by one\ncatcher.\n\n## List of no-hitters in Red Sox history\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * The only team without a no-hitter in franchise history is the San Diego Padres.\n\n## References\n\nGeneral reference\n\nInline citations\n\n",
      "# List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\n\nIn baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter\nis able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any\nrunners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An\nautomatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the\noutfield fence in fair territory. More rarely, an inside-the-park home run\noccurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play\non the field. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the\nhome run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year. Only home\nruns hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead.\nMark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other\nplayer that year. However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL)\nOakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway\nthrough the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24,\nrespectively) did not qualify to lead either league. The first home run\nchampion in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural\n1876 season, Hall hit five home runs for the short-lived National League\nPhiladelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall\nof Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 home runs for the American\nLeague Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 22-season career, Babe\nRuth led the American League in home runs 12 times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph\nKiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt\nwith eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven\nconsecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run\ntitles by any player. Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season home\nrun record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and\nfinally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are tied for the widest margin\nof victory for a home run champion as he topped the next highest total by 35\nhome runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years\nuntil Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years\nlater by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record\nchase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also\nhas the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in\n2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs \u2013\nGreg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez,\nLuis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs\n42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major\nleague was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in\n1878.\n\n## Key\n\n## American League\n\n## National League\n\n## Other major leagues\n\n## See also\n\n  * Babe Ruth Home Run Award (discontinued) \u2013 awarded to the MLB home-run leader\n  * Josh Gibson Legacy Award \u2013 awarded to the AL and NL home-run leaders\n  * Mel Ott Award \u2013 awarded to the NL home-run leader\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * Recognized \"major leagues\" include the current American and National Leagues and several defunct leagues \u2013 the American Association, the Federal League, the Players' League, and the Union Association.\n\n## References\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n",
      "# Hitting streak\n\nIn baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in\nwhich a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According to the\nOfficial Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarily ended when a player\nhas at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated\nif all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch,\ndefensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the\nplayer has a sacrifice fly and no hit. Joe DiMaggio holds the Major League\nBaseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on\nMay 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak (91-for-223),\nwith 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in.\n\n## Major League Baseball records\n\nThere have been 55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a\nhitting streak of at least 30 games. Multiple streaks in the same season have\noccurred in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and\nBenito Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar, Jr.), 1999\n(Vladimir Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras),\nand 2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole\nstreak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar\nevent occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the end\nof another (Jimmy Rollins). Keeler's streak started in his final game of the\n1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season.\nRollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through\nthe first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of\n1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball recognizes two\nhitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest\nhitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005\u20132006). Keeler's,\nSisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when\ndiscussing single-season streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing\nmultiple-season streaks. This list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American\nAssociation Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887,\nthe major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which\nwas dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season,\nbut his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only \"hits\" were\nwalks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so\nLyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists.\nIn 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the\nstatistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand,\neven in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the\nruling affects only hit totals for the year; the batting champion for the year\nis not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-\nseason average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.\nTy Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple\nstreaks of 30 games or longer. There have been 129 single-season streaks of 25\ngames or more. The lowest batting average ever recorded during a hitting\nstreak of 25 games or more was .304 by Bruce Campbell in 1938. The highest was\n.486 during Chuck Klein's streak in 1930. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his\nrecord-holding 56 game streak. In probability theory, every baseball game is a\nBernoulli trial in which a hitter either does or does not get a hit.\nDiMaggio's streak of 56 consecutive games with hits awaits an equal streak:\n\"The probability is .0003 that a .350 hitter will have a hitting streak of at\nleast 56 games in a season. If there are about 4 such seasons per year in the\nfuture, we would expect to see such a streak, assuming the Bernoulli trials\nmodel, every 1/(.0003 x 4) = 833 years.\"\n\n## Major League Baseball records by franchise\n\nOnly currently extant franchises are included on this list. Where a player had\na significant streak while the team was in other than its current city, the\nrecords in these other cities are displayed. As above, for a multi-year\nstreak, the single-season streak is shown in parentheses.\n\n## Minor League Baseball records\n\nThe longest streaks in the history of Minor League Baseball and other\nprofessional baseball leagues: DiMaggio set the Minor League record as a\nmember of the San Francisco Seals. Unrecognized by Minor League Baseball is\nthe 69 game hitting streak by Joe Wilhoit in 1919. Wilhoit was in the\nindependent Western League at the time and his record is considered the all-\ntime Professional Baseball record.\n\n## College Baseball records\n\n## College Softball records\n\n## See also\n\n  * Batting (baseball)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Major League Baseball hitting streaks at mlb.com\n\n",
      "# List of Baltimore Orioles no-hitters\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are a Major League Baseball franchise based in\nBaltimore, Maryland. They play in the American League East division, and were\npreviously known in earlier years as the \u201cMilwaukee Brewers\u201d (1901) and \u201cSt.\nLouis Browns\u201d (1902 to 1953) pitchers for the Orioles have thrown nine no-\nhitters in franchise history.

As\ndefined by Major League Baseball, \"in a perfect game, no batter reaches any\nbase during the course of the game.\" Earl Hamilton threw the first no-hitter\nin Orioles history on August 30, 1912; the most recent no-hitter was a\ncombined effort by Bob Milacki, Mike Flanagan, Mark Williamson and Gregg Olson\non July 13, 1991. No-hitters have been thrown by four left-handed starting\npitchers and five right-handers. Seven no-hitters were thrown at home and two\non the road. There have been two no-hitters in April, three in May, one in\nJuly, two in August, and one in September. The longest interval between no-\nhitters was 36 years from May 6, 1917 (Bob Groom) to May 6, 1953 (Bobo\nHolloman). The shortest interval was one day, May 5, 1917 (Ernie Koob) to May\n6, 1917 (Groom). The franchise no-hit the Oakland Athletics (formerly\n\u201cPhiladelphia Athletics\u201d) the most, three times, by Holloman in 1953, Jim\nPalmer in 1969, and a combined no-hitter by Milacki, Flanagan, Williamson, and\nOlson in 1991. In two no-hitters, the team allowed at least one run: by\nHamilton in 1912 (which was a loss) and a combined no-hitter by Steve Barber\nand Stu Miller in 1967. The most baserunners allowed in a no-hitter was a\ncombined no-no by Barber and Miller, who allowed 14 in a 2\u20131 loss to the\nDetroit Tigers in 1967. Of the nine no-hitters, two have been won by a score\nof 1\u20130 and two by a score of 6\u20130, more common than any other result. The\nlargest margin of victory was an 8\u20130 win by Palmer in 1969. The smallest\nmargin of victory was a 1\u20130 wins by Koob in 1917 and Hoyt Wilhelm in 1958. The\numpire is an integral part of any no-hitter. The umpire makes any decision\n\u201cwhich involves judgment, such as, but not limited to, whether a batted ball\nis fair or foul, whether a pitch is a strike or a ball, or whether a runner is\nsafe or out\u2026 [the umpire\u2019s judgment on such matters] is final.\" Part of the\nduties of the umpire making calls at home plate includes defining the strike\nzone, which \"is defined as that area over homeplate (sic) the upper limit of\nwhich is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders\nand the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow\nbeneath the kneecap.\u201d These calls define every baseball game and are therefore\nintegral to the completion of any no-hitter. Eight different umpires presided\nover each of the franchise\u2019s nine no-hitters. The manager is another integral\npart of a no-hitter. For every game, the manager determines the starting\nrotation (who pitches in each game) as well as the batting order and defensive\nlineup. A manager\u2019s decisions can contribute to a no-hitter. Seven different\nmanagers have overseen the franchise\u2019s nine no-hitters.\n\n## List of no-hitters in Browns/Orioles history\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * The only team without a no-hitter in franchise history is the San Diego Padres.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Alice Hohlmayer\n\nAlice Hohlmayer [Naughton] (January 19, 1925 \u2013 March 25, 2017) was an American\nfirst sacker and pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls\nProfessional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 6\" , 160 lb. , she batted and threw\nleft-handed. Born in Springfield, Ohio, Alice Hohlmayer was the daughter of\nCarl Hohlmayer, a milkman and laundromat owner, and Marguerite (n\u00e9e Waggaman)\nHohlmayer, a housewife. Alice played softball at age five with her brothers\nand later served as a batgirl and player for the Finke and Herne club, which\ntoured across Ohio, being selected at first base for the All-Star team in the\n1937 State's Tournament. Nicknamed \u05f4Lefty\u05f4 from school days, she also played\nbasketball, field hockey, tennis and volleyball. Hohlmayer graduated from\nSpringfield High School in 1942. The next year she entered Ohio State\nUniversity, where she had a chance to show her athletic talent. Then, she was\ndiscovered by an AAGPBL sport in 1945 while playing during a tournament in\nCleveland, and later was contacted by the league's president Max Carey.\nFollowing a tryout at Pascagoula, Mississippi, Hohlmayer entered the league in\n1946 with the Kenosha Comets, playing for them three years before joining the\nMuskegon Lassies (1949), Kalamazoo Lassies (1950) and Peoria Redwings\n(1950\u20131951). She opened at first base, then gradually started to pitch until\nbecoming a full-time pitcher, showing good batting skills and a hard throwing\narm. The versatile Hohlmayer hurled 42 consecutive scoreless innings in 1950,\nand also made 21 putouts at first base in a regular game. Her most productive\nseason came in 1951, when she posted a 15\u201311 record with a 2.02 earned run\naverage and 209 innings of work in 29 pitching appearances. Besides this, she\ngained notoriety for having a hit against legendary pitcher Satchel Paige\nduring an All-Star exhibition game. In a six-year career, Hohlmayer was a .203\nhitter and posted a pitching record of 33\u201332 with a 2.58 ERA. In seven\npostseason games, she hit .136 (3-for-22) and had a 1.29 ERA in seven innings\nwithout a decision. Hohlmayer continued studying while playing baseball,\ngraduating in 1949 from Ohio State with bachelor's degrees in physical\neducation and health. After the 1951 season she returned home to help save the\nfamily laundromat business. Later she married William McNaughton and moved to\nFairfield, California, where she taught at school and worked 17 years for the\nlocal finance department and recreation services, while coaching Little League\nBaseball in her spare time. When widowed in 1960, she brought her two\nchildren, Maichele and Sean. After retiring in 1979, she played on a men's\n55-plus softball team which advanced to the World Slow Pitch Tournament. She\nalso managed a softball team for five years before moving to San Diego,\nCalifornia. In 1988, Alice became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent\ndisplay based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New\nYork, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional\nBaseball League. Afterwards, she was nominated and inducted into the Women's\nHall of Fame in 2005 for the title of Spirit Of The Women's Hall Of Fame. The\nannual Women's Hall of Fame induction is co-hosted by Women's Museum of\nCalifornia (located in San Diego), Commission on the Status of Women, UC San\nDiego Women's Center, and San Diego State Women's Studies. Alice Hohlmayer\nMcNaughton was a longtime resident of Bonita, California, where she died in\n2017 at the age of 92.\n\n## Career statistics\n\nBatting Pitching Fielding\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# Ms. Pac-Man\n\nGeneral Computer originally made the game as a modification kit for the\noriginal Pac-Man, titled Crazy Otto. Following legal action with Atari, GCC\nwas forced to present the project to Midway Games, the North American\ndistributor of Pac-Man, before release, who purchased the project. Multiple\nnames were made for the game, including Super Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man and Mrs.\nPac-Man, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. Namco\npresident Masaya Nakamura helped design the character of Ms. Pac-Man, and\ncollected royalties for each arcade cabinet sold. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by\ncritics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist,\nsome labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest\nvideo games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games\never made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and\nhandheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms.\nPac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor\ncompany, Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by\neating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to\nlose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the monsters to\nturn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be\neaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase,\nthe speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the\nmonsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n### Differences from the original Pac-Man\n\n  * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.\n  * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.\n  * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.\n  * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.\n  * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.\n  * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.\n  * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \"she dramatically swoons and falls\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.\n  * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the attract opening sequence for Jr. Pac-Man.\n  * The sound effects and music are all new.\n\n### Fruit point values\n\nAfter level 7, any fruit will appear, although its point value will be the\nsame (unlike in Pac-Man, in which the Key will always be the fruit after level\n13).\n\n## History\n\nMs. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called\nCrazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer\nCorporation (GCC). While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a\nlawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile\nAttack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion\nkits without consent from the original game manufacturer. Rather than\nscrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed\ngame to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become\nimpatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would\nbe Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their\nattention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco\nto prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and\ncharacters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game\nelements were altered to better reflect the Pac-Man series. The game was\ninitially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character.\nInspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female\ncounterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-\nWoman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then\nrealized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby\nto Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their\nrelationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac-Man, and then\nfinally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve\nGolson said \"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super\nPac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all\noccurred within 72 hours of actual production. According to one 1982 estimate,\na majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki\nof Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original\nPac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of\nwomen as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders\nwho have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\" The game was later awarded the\nCertificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982\nArcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular,\nMidway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer\nList of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent,\ncausing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-\nMan was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that\neventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and\nMidway. GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was\nmanufactured without Namco's blessing. Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at\nthat time, helped design the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae\nsaid, \"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the\nPresident of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept,\nget rid of the hair.' Ms. Pac-Man lost her hair\u2013it was actually Pac-Woman at\nthe time, I believe. The beauty mark stayed, and the lips stayed. I think we\nadded a bow, and were quickly done with it, so Ms. Pac-Man had been created.\"\nHowever, Macrae also said, \"At the same time, there was a little bit of\nembarrassment, I believe, in-house in Japan, of the fact that the sequel was\nbeing done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement\nthat Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms.\nPac-Man, being the same as what they got on Pac-Man, and Midway could choose\nto do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\"\n\n## Ports\n\nAtari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and\nAtari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX\nSpectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the\nAtarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all\nfour intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A.

      "# Ms. Pac-Man\n\nGeneral Computer originally made the game as a modification kit for the\noriginal Pac-Man, titled Crazy Otto. Following legal action with Atari, GCC\nwas forced to present the project to Midway Games, the North American\ndistributor of Pac-Man, before release, who purchased the project. Multiple\nnames were made for the game, including Super Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man and Mrs.\nPac-Man, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. Namco\npresident Masaya Nakamura helped design the character of Ms. Pac-Man, and\ncollected royalties for each arcade cabinet sold. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by\ncritics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist,\nsome labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest\nvideo games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games\never made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and\nhandheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms.\nPac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor\ncompany, Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by\neating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to\nlose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the monsters to\nturn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be\neaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase,\nthe speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the\nmonsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n### Differences from the original Pac-Man\n\n  * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.\n  * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.\n  * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.\n  * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.\n  * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.\n  * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.\n  * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \"she dramatically swoons and falls\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.\n  * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the attract opening sequence for Jr. Pac-Man.\n  * The sound effects and music are all new.\n\n### Fruit point values\n\nAfter level 7, any fruit will appear, although its point value will be the\nsame (unlike in Pac-Man, in which the Key will always be the fruit after level\n13).\n\n## History\n\nMs. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called\nCrazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer\nCorporation (GCC). While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a\nlawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile\nAttack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion\nkits without consent from the original game manufacturer. Rather than\nscrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed\ngame to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become\nimpatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would\nbe Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their\nattention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco\nto prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and\ncharacters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game\nelements were altered to better reflect the Pac-Man series. The game was\ninitially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character.\nInspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female\ncounterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-\nWoman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then\nrealized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby\nto Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their\nrelationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac-Man, and then\nfinally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve\nGolson said \"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super\nPac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all\noccurred within 72 hours of actual production. According to one 1982 estimate,\na majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki\nof Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original\nPac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of\nwomen as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders\nwho have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\" The game was later awarded the\nCertificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982\nArcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular,\nMidway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer\nList of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent,\ncausing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-\nMan was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that\neventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and\nMidway. GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was\nmanufactured without Namco's blessing. Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at\nthat time, helped design the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae\nsaid, \"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the\nPresident of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept,\nget rid of the hair.' Ms. Pac-Man lost her hair\u2013it was actually Pac-Woman at\nthe time, I believe. The beauty mark stayed, and the lips stayed. I think we\nadded a bow, and were quickly done with it, so Ms. Pac-Man had been created.\"\nHowever, Macrae also said, \"At the same time, there was a little bit of\nembarrassment, I believe, in-house in Japan, of the fact that the sequel was\nbeing done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement\nthat Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms.\nPac-Man, being the same as what they got on Pac-Man, and Midway could choose\nto do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\"\n\n## Ports\n\nAtari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and\nAtari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX\nSpectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the\nAtarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all\nfour intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was\npublished to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \"A decent adaptation overall,\nand a good game in its own right.\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man\ngames, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the\narcades, you'll love her here, too.\"\n\n## Intellectual rights\n\nThe GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway Games in 1982, as\nat the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from\nNamco.

At the age of five, Mariyappan suffered permanent\ndisability in his right leg when he was run over by a drunk bus driver while\nwalking to school; the bus crushed his leg below the knee, causing it to\nbecome stunted. Despite this setback, he completed secondary schooling; he\nsays he \"didn't see myself as different from able-bodied kids.\"\n\n## Athletic career\n\nMariyappan enjoyed playing volleyball as a student; subsequently, his school\nphysical education instructor encouraged him to try high jumping. In his first\ncompetitive event, aged 14, he placed second among a field of able-bodied\ncompetitors, after which he received strong encouragement from his classmates\nand others in Salem district. In 2013, his current coach Mr.Satyanarayana,\nsupported by the Sports academy of India for differently-abled, first noticed\nhis performance at the Indian national para-athletics championships, and\nformally took him on as a student in 2015, bringing him to Bengaluru for\nfurther coaching. In March 2016, Mariyappan cleared a distance of in the men's\nhigh jump T\u201342 event at the IPC Grand Prix in Tunisia, qualifying him for the\nRio Paralympics.

      "# Triple jump at the Olympics\n\nThe triple jump at the Summer Olympics is grouped among the four track and\nfield jumping events held at the multi-sport event. The men's triple jump has\nbeen present on the Olympic athletics programme since the first Summer\nOlympics in 1896. The women's triple jump is one of the more recent additions\nto the programme, having been first contested in 1996. It became the third\nOlympic jumping event for women after the high jump and long jump. The Olympic\nrecords for the event are for men, set by Kenny Harrison in 1996, and for\nwomen, set by Fran\u00e7oise Mbango Etone in 2008. The men's triple jump world\nrecord was broken at the competition in 1924, 1932, 1936, 1956 and 1968. At\nthe 1968 Summer Olympics, three men improved the record a total of five times\nat the high altitude of Mexico City. The women's world record has never been\nbroken at the Olympics and the current mark of , set in 1995, pre-dates the\nfirst Olympic event. James Brendan Connolly was the first Olympic triple jump\nchampion and, as it was the first event to conclude in 1896, he was also the\nfirst Olympic champion of the modern era. Inessa Kravets, the world record\nholder, became the first women's champion 100 years later. American Christian\nTaylor and Colombian Caterine Ibarg\u00fcen are the reigning Olympic champions from\n2016. Viktor Saneyev is the event's most successful athlete as he was Olympic\nchampion three times consecutively from 1968 to 1976, as well as runner-up in\n1980. Fran\u00e7oise Mbango Etone is the only woman to win two Olympic triple jump\ntitles. Saneyev, Vilho Tuulos and Tatyana Lebedeva are the only three athletes\nto have won more than two Olympic medals in the event. The United States is\nthe most successful nation in the event, with eight gold medals to its name.\nThe Soviet Union is the next most successful, with four golds. A short-lived\nstanding triple jump variant of the event was contested in 1900 and 1904 and\nstanding jumps specialist Ray Ewry won both gold medals.\n\n## Medalists\n\n### Men\n\n#### Multiple medalists\n\n#### Medalists by country\n\n### Women\n\n#### Multiple medalists\n\n#### Medalists by country\n\n## Standing triple jump\n\nIn 1900 and 1904 a variation of the event was contested at the Olympics where\nathletes had to triple jump from a standing position. This was one of three\nstanding jumps to have featured on the Olympic programme, alongside the\nstanding high jump and the standing long jump (both running from 1900 to\n1912). The standing jump competitions were dominated by Ray Ewry, who won the\n1900 Olympic standing triple jump title and defended it four years later. His\nclearance of to win the inaugural competition went unbettered as the Olympic\nrecord for the event. Ewry took Olympic three gold medals in standing jumps in\nboth 1900 and 1904, then won the standing high and long jumps at the 1908\nOlympics, as well as the 1906 Intercalated Games. Standing jump events had\nbeen a relatively common type of athletics event at the end of the 19th\ncentury, but became increasingly rare at top level national and international\ncompetitions as the 20th century progressed. The standing triple jump was the\nleast common of the standing jumps and the Olympics remains the only major\ninternational competition to have featured the event.\n\n## References\n\nParticipation and athlete data\n\n* Athletics Men's Triple Jump Medalists.

The\nathletics programme was the largest element of the Games programme in terms of\nentrants and medals awarded.\n\n## Classification and events\n\nAthletes are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their\ndisability. The classification system allows athletes to compete against\nothers with a similar level of function. The athletics classifications are:\n\n  * 11\u201313: Blind (11) and visually impaired (12, 13) athletes\n  * 20: Athletes with an intellectual disability\n  * 31\u201338: Athletes with cerebral palsy; 31-34 for wheelchair events, 35-38 for ambulant (running) events\n  * 40-41: Les Autres (others) (including people with dwarfism)\n  * 42\u201347: Amputees\n  * 51\u201358: Athletes with a spinal cord disability\n\nThe class numbers were given prefixes of \"T\" and \"F\" for track and field\nevents, respectively. High jump and Long jump, while field events, usually\nattract a \"T\" classification Visually impaired athletes classified 11 run with\nfull eye shades and a guide runner; those classified 12 have the option of\nusing a guide; those classified 13 do not use a guide runner. Guide runners\nare awarded medals alongside their athletes. On 9 June 2015, the IPC announced\nthe final make up of the Rio 2016 athletics programme. There have been several\nchanges in the programme, including the elimination of triple jump events, and\nthe reduction of events requiring a factoring system, as this was seen to\nundermine the image of the event as sport.

      "# 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nThe following medal table is a list of National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and\none non-NOC team ranked by the number of gold medals won by their athletes\nduring the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, from 5 to 21 August 2016.\nVietnam, Kosovo, Fiji, Singapore, Puerto Rico, Bahrain, Jordan, Tajikistan and\nIvory Coast won their first Olympic gold medals (however, Bahrain\nretroactively won a gold medal for the 2012 Summer Olympics due to medals\nreallocation). They were also Kosovo's, Fiji's, and Jordan's first Olympic\nmedals of any kind. Kuwaiti shooter Fehaid Al-Deehani became the first\nindependent athlete to win a gold medal, though gold medals have been won\nunder the Olympic flag by other entities, such as countries that competed\nunder the flag at 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow or the Unified Team in 1992.\nThe United States of America led the medal table both in number of gold medals\nwon (as the medals are listed on the official website of the Games, and\ninternationally by tradition), and in overall medals (the traditional method\nby which the table is listed in the United States), winning 46 gold and 121\ntotal medals respectively. Behind the United States, Great Britain were second\non the medal table by golds (27), and third by overall medals (67) \u2013 their\nhighest finish in the former case since the home games of 1908 and in the\nlatter since 1920, while China were third by golds (26), but second by overall\nmedals (70). Both countries were well clear of a group of challengers for\nfourth in the table including Russia, Germany, France and 2020 hosts Japan.\nAthletes from 87 nations earned medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics, breaking\nthe record of most nations winning a medal at a single edition of the\nOlympics. However, following reallocation due to doping sanctions, an 87th\ncountry was later awarded a medal at the 2008 Olympics, tying the record.\nAthletes from 59 nations earned gold medals at these games, also breaking the\nrecord for the most number of nations winning gold at a single games. Host\ncountry Brazil won seven gold medals, their most at any single Summer\nOlympics.\n\n## Medals\n\nThe design for the Olympic medals for the 2016 Summer Olympics featured the\nlargest medals in terms of diameter of any medal presented at the Olympics.\nThe golds are purer than any presented at all preceding Olympics. The silvers\nwere made from recycling mirrors, solder, and X-ray plates. Much of the copper\nused in the bronzes came from recycling waste from the mint that minted the\nmedals. The obverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.\n\n## Medal table\n\nThis is the table of the medal count of the 2016 Summer Olympics, based on the\nmedal count of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). These rankings sort\nby the number of gold medals, earned by a National Olympic Committee (NOC).\nThe number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the\nnumber of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal\nranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC Country Code.\nAlthough this information is provided by the IOC, the IOC itself does not\nrecognize or endorse any ranking system. The 2016 Summer Olympic program\nfeatured 28 sports with 41 disciplines, and a total of 306 events, tentatively\nresulting in 306 medal sets to be distributed. Athletes from 87 countries won\nmedals, and 59 of them won at least one gold medal. Both of these categories\nset new records. Two gold medals were awarded for a first-place tie in the\nwomen's 100 metre freestyle swimming event. No silver medal was awarded as a\nconsequence. Three silver medals were awarded for a second-place tie in the\nmen's 100 metre butterfly swimming event. No bronze medal was awarded as a\nconsequence. In boxing (13 disciplines), judo (14), taekwondo (8), and\nwrestling (18), two bronze medals are awarded in each event (53 additional\nbronze medals total). Additionally, two bronze medals were awarded for a\nthird-place tie in the women's 100 metre backstroke swimming and in the men's\nK-1 200 metres canoeing events.\n\n## Changes in medal standings\n\n### List of official changes\n\n## See also\n\n  * 2016 Summer Paralympics medal table\n  * All-time Olympic Games medal table\n  * List of IOC country codes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Rio 2016 at International Olympic Committee\n\n",

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible.

T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans.

      "# Bette Davis Eyes\n\n\"Bette Davis Eyes\" is a song written and composed by Donna Weiss and Jackie\nDeShannon, and made popular by American singer Kim Carnes. DeShannon recorded\nit in 1974; Carnes's 1981 version spent nine non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on\nthe Billboard Hot 100 and was Billboard's biggest hit of 1981.\n\n## Background\n\nThe song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon. DeShannon\nrecorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement. In this\noriginal incarnation, the track is performed in an \"R&B; lite\" arrangement,\nfeaturing a prominent uptempo piano part, as well as flourishes of pedal steel\nguitar and horns. However, it was not until March 1981, when Kim Carnes\nrecorded her version of the song in a radically different synthesizer-based\narrangement, that \"Bette Davis Eyes\" became a commercial success. The Carnes\nversion spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot 100\n(originally on top for five weeks, then interrupted for one week by the \"Stars\non 45 Medley\", then returned to the top spot for another four weeks) and was\nBillboard's biggest hit of the year for 1981. The single also reached No. 5 on\nBillboards Top Tracks charts and No. 26 on the Dance charts. The song won the\nGrammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The song was also a\nnumber one hit in 21 countries and peaked at number 10 in the United Kingdom,\nher only Top 40 hit there to date. It also reached number two in Canada for\ntwelve consecutive weeks, and was the No. 2 hit of 1981 in the country.\nAccording to producer Val Garay, the original demo of the tune that was\nbrought to him sounded like \"a Leon Russell track, with this beer-barrel polka\npiano part.\" The demo can be heard in a Val Garay interview on TAXI TV at\n21:50. Keyboardist Bill Cuomo came up with the signature synth riff, using the\nSequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer, which now defines Carnes's version.\nThe song was recorded in the studio on the first take. Actress Bette Davis, at\nthe time 73 years old, wrote letters to Carnes, Weiss, and DeShannon to thank\nall three of them for making her \"a part of modern times,\" and said her\ngrandson now looked up to her. After their Grammy wins, Davis sent them roses\nas well. The song was ranked at number 12 on Billboard's list of the top 100\nsongs in the first 50 years of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Cleopatra Records\nreleased a re-recording of the song as a single in 2007.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video, directed by Australian film director Russell Mulcahy, received\nheavy airplay when it premiered. The video starts with a leaning figure draped\nin black at the center of a dance hall. The drape flies out to reveal Kim\nCarnes wearing sunglasses as she sings the first verse. In the first chorus,\nshe performs with a band; halfway, dancers enter the hall. In the second\nverse, the dancers make slapping and floor-pounding dance motions. They\ndisappear and reappear in the second chorus. The song finishes with the\ndancers making dance motions while approaching Carnes; the band is already\ngone when the video ends with the black-draped leaning figure. A shadowed\nsilhouette of Bette Davis smoking a cigarette appears throughout the video.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nJackie DeShannon sings \"she knows just what it takes to make a crow blush\",\nwhile Kim Carnes replaces \"crow\" with \"pro\".\n\n## Track listing and formats\n\n  * 7\" single\n\n  1. \"Bette Davis Eyes\" \u2013 3:45\n  2. \"Miss You Tonite\" \u2013 5:11 \n\n  * US 12\" maxi-single\n\n  1. \"Bette Davis Eyes\" \u2013 3:45\n  2. \"Miss You Tonite\" \u2013 5:11\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n### All-time charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## See also\n\n    * List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s\n    * List of Top 25 singles for 1981 in Australia\n    * List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1981\n    * Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1981\n    * List of Cash Box Top 100 number-one singles of 1981\n    * List of number-one singles of 1981 (France)\n    * List of number-one hits of 1981 (Germany)\n    * List of number-one hits (Italy)\n    * List of number-one songs in Norway\n    * List of number-one singles of 1981 (Spain)\n    * List of number-one singles of the 1980s (Switzerland)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\n\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the opening song from the musical Oklahoma!,\nwhich premiered on Broadway in 1943. It was written by composer Richard\nRodgers and lyricist/librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The leading male\ncharacter in Oklahoma!, Curly McLain, sings the song at the beginning of the\nfirst scene of the musical. The refrain runs: \"Oh, what a beautiful mornin'! /\nOh, what a beautiful day! / I've got a beautiful feelin' / Ev'rythin's goin'\nmy way.\" Curly's \"brimming optimism is perfectly captured by Rodgers'\nebullient music and Hammerstein's buoyant pastoral lyrics.\" This was the first\nsong of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical collaboration to be heard by theatre\naudiences. It has become one of their most famous numbers and \"quickly became\none of the most popular American songs to emerge from the wartime era, gaining\ncurrency away from Broadway first on the radio and recordings, and then later\non numerous television variety shows.\" Brooks Atkinson, reviewing the original\nproduction in The New York Times, wrote that the number changed the history of\nmusical theatre: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the\nbanalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\"\n\n## Noteworthy recordings\n\nNoteworthy recordings include the following:\n\n  * Bing Crosby and Trudy Erwin recorded the song in 1943 for Decca, as the B-side of a single covering \"People Will Say We're In Love\". The recording peaked at No. 4 on US charts.\n  * Frank Sinatra recorded the song as a single in 1943, released by Columbia Records as catalogue number 36682, it reached the No. 12 spot in the charts. The song appears on more than two dozen Frank Sinatra compilations. Sinatra first recorded the song a cappella: \"a musician's strike ... occurred just as Sinatra was set to enter the studio and lay down his first tracks under the Columbia banner, so ... Sinatra went into the studio with a group of vocalists and recorded several songs ... a cappella\".\n  * Ray Charles recorded the song several times, and one of his live recordings from the 1970s with the Count Basie Orchestra is included on his posthumous album Ray Sings, Basie Swings (2006)\n  * Eels included the song on their live album Oh What a Beautiful Morning (2000).\n  * James Taylor recorded the song in 2008 and released it as a bonus track on his album Covers (2008) and also on his album Other Covers (2009).\n  * Sharon, Lois & Bram recorded a version and performed it on their television program, Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show.\n\nOther artists who have recorded the song include Rosemary Clooney on several\nof her albums, Peggy Lee, Nelson Eddy, and Joanie Bartels. Classical singers\nwho have recorded it include Placido Domingo, Bryn Terfel, Marilyn Horne and\nSamuel Ramey, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir made a choral version.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nEthan Mordden titled his book about the dawn of the \"Golden Age\" of musicals\nBeautiful Mornin: The Broadway Musical in the 1940s (1999).\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\": Gordon MacRae sings the song in the original film version (1955)\n  * \"Great Performances\" version: Hugh Jackman sings the song in the PBS production of Oklahoma!

      "# One of These Nights (song)\n\n\"One of These Nights\" is a song written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey and\nrecorded by the American rock band Eagles. The title track from their One of\nThese Nights album, the song became their second single to top the Billboard\nHot 100 chart after \"Best of My Love\" and also helped propel the album to\nnumber one. The single version was shortened from the album version of the\nsong, removing most of the song's intro and most of its fade-out, as well.\nHenley is lead vocalist on the verses, while Randy Meisner sings high harmony\n(not lead) on the refrain. The song features a guitar solo by Don Felder that\nis \"composed of blues-based licks and sustained string bends using an\nunusually meaty distortion tone.\"\n\n## Background\n\nThe song was a conscious attempt by the band to write something different from\na country-rock and ballad-type song. Don Henley said: \"We like to be a nice\nlittle country-rock band from Los Angeles ... about half the time.\" He added:\n\"We wanted to get away from the ballad syndrome with \"One of These Nights.\"\nWith Don Felder in the band now, we can really rock.\" Frey said that they\n\"wanted 'One of These Nights' to have a lot of teeth, a lot of bite\u2014a nasty\ntrack with pretty vocals.\" The writing was influenced by R&B; music and disco;\naccording to Frey, he was listening to Spinners and Al Green records when he\nstarted writing the song. Frey started the writing process by composing the\nmusic, and Henley then started with the lyrics. Frey said: \"I just went over\nto the piano and I started playing this little minor descending progression,\nand he comes over and goes, 'One of these nights'.\" After that, Frey said:\n\"What usually happens is when we get the thing fused together, he gets\ninvolved in the music and I get involved in the lyrics.\" While they were\nrecording the album in Miami, the band also shared a studio with the Bee Gees,\nand according to Henley, the \"four-on-the-floor\" bass-drum pattern is a nod to\ndisco. In the liner notes of The Very Best Of, Frey had this to say about the\nsong: Frey also said that the song is about putting things off. \"We've all\nsaid, 'One of these nights I'm gonna do something -- get that girl, make that\nmoney, find that house.' We all have our dreams \u2013 a vision we hope will come\ntrue someday. When that 'someday' will come is up to each of us.\" On the\nrecording, Frey said: \"We cut the basic track in Miami in December at Criteria\nStudios. We took it to L.A., put all the drone guitars and Felder's solo on in\nL.A., and went back to Miami to put the vocals on in March.\" The B-side,\n\"Visions\", features lead vocals by guitarist Don Felder, the only Eagles song\nto do so.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Don Henley \u2013 lead vocals, drums\n  * Glenn Frey \u2013 piano, backing vocals\n  * Don Felder \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar\n  * Randy Meisner \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\n  * Bernie Leadon \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Get Up Offa That Thing\n\n\"Get Up Offa That Thing\" is a song written and performed by James Brown. It\nwas released in 1976 as a two-part single (the B-side, titled \"Release the\nPressure\", is a continuation of the same song). It reached #4 on the R&B;\nchart, briefly returning Brown to the Top Ten after a year's absence, and #45\non the Billboard Hot 100. Thanks to its chart success, the song became Brown's\nbiggest hit of the late 1970s. The song's lyrics urge listeners to \"Get up\noffa that thing / and dance 'til you feel better.\" Due to his troubles with\nthe IRS for failure to pay back taxes, Brown credited authorship of the song\nto his wife Diedre and their daughters, Deanna and Yamma Brown.\n\n## Background\n\nAccording to Brown, the inspiration for \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" came to him\nduring a club performance in Fort Lauderdale:The audience was sitting down,\ntrying to do a sophisticated thing, listening to funk. One of the tightest\nbands they'd ever heard in their lives, and they were sitting. I had worked\nhard and dehydrated myself and was feeling depressed. I looked out at all\nthose people sitting there, and because I was depressed they looked depressed.\nI yelled, \"Get up offa that thing and dance til you feel better!\" I probably\nmeant until I felt better. Unlike most popular music of the time, which made\nsophisticated use of multitrack recording and other techniques, \"Get Up Offa\nThat Thing\" was recorded live in the studio in only two takes. Brown re-\nrecorded \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" for the Doctor Detroit soundtrack album. He\nalso performs the song during his guest appearance in the film. Other\nperformances of the song appear on the albums Hot on the One, Live in New\nYork, Live at Chastain Park, and Live at the Apollo 1995.\n\n## Credits and personnel\n\n  * James Brown \u2013 lead vocal\n\nwith The J.B.'s:\n\n  * Russell Crimes \u2013 trumpet\n  * Holly Ferris \u2013 trombone\n  * St. Clair Pinckney \u2013 tenor saxophone\n  * Peyton Johnson \u2013 tenor saxophone\n  * Joe Poff Jr. - alto saxophone\n  * Jimmy Nolen \u2013 guitar\n  * Robert Lee Coleman \u2013 guitar\n  * Charles Sherrell \u2013 clavinet\n  * Melvin Parker \u2013 drums\n  * Will Lee \u2013 bass\n\n## Chart performance\n\n## Appearances in other media\n\n  * \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" was performed as a mash-up with \"Dancing in the Street\" by the nuns of Sister Act 2 as led by Whoopi Goldberg.\n  * It was played during the \"Soccer\" episode of The Wonder Years with the beginning of the opening game.\n  * The song is used twice in Jim Henson Pictures 1999 film Muppets from Space when Gonzo rides the lawnmower.\n  * The song is featured in the 2009 British film Fish Tank.\n  * The song is used in the closing sequence of Paramount's 1996 film Harriet the Spy and Blue Sky Studios' 2005 computer animated film Robots.

      "# Ventura Highway\n\n\"Ventura Highway\" is a 1972 song by the band America from their album\nHomecoming.\n\n## Background\n\nDewey Bunnell, the song's vocalist and writer, has said that the lyric\n\"alligator lizards in the air\" in the song is a reference to the shapes of\nclouds in the sky he saw in 1963 while his family was driving down the coast\nfrom Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California, where they had a flat\ntire. While his father changed the tire, his brother and he stood by the side\nof the road and watched the clouds and saw a road sign for \"Ventura\". In the\nbooklet for the boxed set, Highway, he states that the song \"reminds me of the\ntime I lived in Omaha as a kid and how we'd walk through cornfields and chew\non pieces of grass. There were cold winters, and I had images of going to\nCalifornia. So I think in the song I'm talking to myself, frankly: 'How long\nyou gonna stay here, Joe?' I really believe that 'Ventura Highway' has the\nmost lasting power of all my songs. It's not just the words \u2014 the song and the\ntrack have a certain fresh, vibrant, optimistic quality that I can still\nrespond to\". The song has a \"Go West, young man\" motif in the structure of a\nconversation between an old man named Joe and a young and hopeful kid. Joe was\nmodeled after a \"grumpy\" old man he had met while his dad was stationed in\nBiloxi, Mississippi at Keesler Air Force Base. He also stated \"I remember\nvividly having this mental picture of the stretch of the coastline traveling\nwith my family when I was younger. Ventura Highway itself, there is no such\nbeast, what I was really trying to depict was the Pacific Coast Highway,\nHighway 1, which goes up to the town of Ventura.\" \"That's Gerry and Dan doing\na harmony on two guitars on the intro. I remember us sitting in a hotel room,\nand I was playing the chords, and Gerry got that guitar line, and he and Dan\nworked out that harmony part. That's really the hook of the song\".\n\n## Reception\n\nThe song went to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 for America, spending 12\nweeks on the charts after debuting on October 21, 1972. It also reached number\n43 in the UK Singles Chart, staying in that chart for 4 weeks.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe song contains the phrase \"purple rain\", later the title of a 1984 song,\nalbum, and film (and the tour that supported both the album and film), from\nthe artist Prince. Although whether actually any connection exists, both Mikel\nToombs of The San Diego Union and Bob Kostanczuk of the Post-Tribune have\nwritten that Prince got the title directly from \"Ventura Highway\". Asked to\nexplain the phrase \"purple rain\" in \"Ventura Highway,\" Gerry Beckley\nresponded: \"You got me.\" The song won many fans, including the pro wrestler-\nturned-politician, Jesse Ventura. Bunnell recalled, \"We went and played at\nGovernor Jesse Ventura's inaugural out in Minneapolis. He asked us to \u2014 his\nwife is a horse lady, and she'd always loved 'A Horse with No Name', and he\nhad adopted this name Ventura. So when he put together his cast of characters\nfor his big inaugural celebration, he wanted us to come and play two songs,\nwhich we did\".\n\n## Chart performance\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## Sampling and cover versions\n\n  * The song's opening guitar riff and musical hook is sampled throughout Janet Jackson's 2001 song \"Someone to Call My Lover\" by the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis who were influenced by America and \"Ventura Highway\" listening to KDWB 63 AM (Top 40) growing up in Minneapolis, Minnesota (along with their close friend, musician Prince). Bunnell said the use of the sample from \"Ventura Highway\" and the production by Jam, Lewis and Jackson boosted sales for America.\n\n  * In 2004, the song was recorded by Paul Hardcastle for the compilation album Jazzmasters (The Smooth Cuts) featuring Helen Rogers on vocals.\n\n  * In 2012, the song was recorded by the private party band The Gypsy Queens for their album The Gypsy Queens, featuring Booker T. Jones, as well as Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (author of the song) of the original America line-up. The album was produced by multiple Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. It was recorded at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles (Jim Henson Company). The album reached number 46 in the UK charts.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",

      "# Joint Session of the Parliament of India\n\nThe Parliament of India is bicameral. Concurrence of both houses are required\nto pass any bill. However, the makers of the Constitution of India anticipated\nsituations of deadlock between the upper house i.e. Rajya Sabha and the lower\nhouse i.e. Lok Sabha. Therefore, the Constitution of India provides for Joint\nsittings of both the Houses to break this deadlock. The joint sitting of the\nParliament is called by the President (Article 108) and is presided over by\nthe Speaker or, in his absence, by the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha or in\nhis absence, the Deputy-Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The Chairman doesn't\npreside over the joint session at any means/cost. If any of the above officers\nare not present then any other member of the Parliament can preside by\nconsensus of both the House.\n\n## Provisions of Constitution\n\nAs per Article 108 of Constitution, a Joint session of Parliament can be\nsummoned in the following situations. If after a Bill has been passed by one\nHouse and submitted to the other House\u2014 (a) the Bill is rejected by the other\nHouse; or (b) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be\nmade in the Bill; or (c) more than six months elapse from the date of the\nreception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being passed by it,\nthe President may, unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of\nthe House of the People, notify to the Houses by message if they are sitting\nor by public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon\nthem to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on\nthe Bill. However, in calculating period of six months, those days are not\nconsidered when house is prorogued or adjourned for more than 4 consecutive\ndays. If the above conditions are satisfied, the President of India may summon\njoint sitting of both the houses of parliament.\n\n## Exception to joint sittings\n\nNot all bills can be referred to a joint sitting of Parliament. There are two\nexceptions: 1\\. Money Bill Under the Constitution of India, money bills\nrequire approval of the Lok Sabha only.

      "# Speaker of the Lok Sabha\n\nThe Speaker of the Lok Sabha is the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha (House\nof the People), the lower house of the Parliament of India. The speaker is\nelected generally in the first meeting of the Lok Sabha following general\nelections. Serving for a term of five years, the speaker chosen from sitting\nmembers of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), and is by convention a member\nof the ruling party or alliance. Om Birla of the Bharatiya Janata Party is the\ncurrent Speaker who presides over the 17th Lok Sabha.\n\n## Election of the Speaker\n\nNewly elected Members of Parliament from the Lok Sabha elect the Speaker among\nthemselves. The Speaker should be someone who understands Lok Sabha functions\nand it someone accepted among the ruling and opposition parties. MPs propose a\nname to the Pro tem speaker. These names are notified to the President of\nIndia. The President through their aide Secretary-General notifies the\nelection date. If only one name is proposed, the Speaker is elected without\nany formal vote. However, if more than one nomination is received, a division\n(vote) is called. MPs vote for their candidate on such date notified by\nPresident. The successful candidate is elected as Speaker of the Lok Sabha\nuntil the next general election.\n\n## Powers and functions of the Speaker\n\nThe Speaker of the Lok Sabha conducts the business in house, and decides\nwhether a bill is a money bill or not. They maintain discipline and decorum in\nthe house and can punish a member for unruly behaviour by suspending them.\nThey also permit the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions such\nas a motion of no confidence, motion of adjournment, motion of censure and\ncalling attention notice as per the rules. The Speaker decides on the agenda\nto be taken up for discussion during the meeting. The date of election of the\nSpeaker is fixed by the President. Further, all comments and speeches made by\nmembers of the House are addressed to the Speaker. The Speaker also presides\nover the joint sitting of both houses of the Parliament of India. The\ncounterpart of the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States) is its\nChairperson; the Vice-President of India is the ex-officio chairperson of the\nRajya Sabha. On the order of precedence, the Speaker of Lok Sabha ranks sixth,\nalong with the Chief Justice of India. The Speaker is answerable to the House.\nBoth the Speaker and Deputy Speaker may be removed by a resolution passed by\nthe majority of the members. Lok Sabha Speaker can be elected by President on\nnomination basis\n\n## Removal of the speaker\n\nSpeaker can be removed by the Lok Sabha by a resolution passed by an effective\nmajority (>50% of total strength excluding vacancies) of the house as per .\nThe Speaker is also removed on being disqualified for being Lok Sabha member\nunder sections 7 and 8 of Representation of the People Act, 1951. This would\narise out of speaker's wrong certification of a bill as money bill\ninconsistent with the definition given in of the constitution. When courts\nuphold the unconstitutional act of the speaker for wrong certification of a\nbill as money bill, it amounts to disrespecting the constitution deserving\nconviction under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 which is\napplicable for disqualification of speaker's Lok Sabha membership under\nsection 8K of Representation of the People Act, 1951. However, the omissions\nin the procedure committed by the speaker in the Lok Sabha can not be\nchallenged in court of law per .\n\n## Pro tem Speaker\n\nAfter a general election and the formation of a new government, a list of\nsenior Lok Sabha members prepared by the Legislative Section is submitted to\nthe Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, who selects a pro tem speaker. The\nappointment has to be approved by the President. The first meeting after the\nelection when the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker are selected by members of\nthe Parliament is held under the pro tem Speaker. In absence of the Speaker,\nthe Deputy Speaker acts as Speaker and in the absence of both a committee of\nsix members selected by the Speaker will act as Speaker according to their\nseniority.

      "# The 100 (TV series)\n\nThe 100 (pronounced The Hundred) is an American post-apocalyptic science\nfiction drama television series that premiered on March 19, 2014, on The CW.\nThe series, developed by Jason Rothenberg, is loosely based on the novel\nseries of the same name by Kass Morgan. The series follows a group of post-\napocalyptic survivors, chiefly a group of criminal adolescents, including\nClarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake\n(Bob Morley), Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon\nBostick), Monty Green (Christopher Larkin), Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), John\nMurphy (Richard Harmon), and Wells Jaha (Eli Goree). They are among the first\npeople from a space habitat, the Ark, to return to Earth after a devastating\nnuclear apocalypse. Other lead characters include Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige\nTurco), Clarke's mother; Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a council member on\nthe Ark; and Thelonious Jaha (Isaiah Washington), the Chancellor of the Ark\nand Wells's father. In April 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh\nseason, which will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced\nthat the series will conclude with the seventh season.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe setting is 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out\nalmost all life on Earth. Thousands of people live in a space station orbiting\nEarth, which they call the Ark, constructed of connecting space stations and\nspacecraft. Three generations have been born in space, bringing the population\nof the Ark beyond carrying capacity. The future is jeopardized by over-\npopulation. 100 juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to\ndetermine whether it is habitable. They discover that some survived the\napocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the\nReapers, another group of Grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the\nMountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from\nthose who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership\nof Bellamy and Clarke, the 100 attempt to survive the harsh surface\nconditions, battle hostile Grounders and establish communication with the Ark.\nIn the second season, 48 of the remaining 100 are captured and taken to Mount\nWeather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men\nare transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment\nas their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on\nEarth. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation\nefficacy: their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside\ncontainment. The inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on\nEarth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people,\nnaming the main settlement at Alpha Station \"Camp Jaha\". In the third season,\nAlpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former\nteacher, and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with\nthe Grounders. Pike uses very dangerous methods, which further damages their\nalready fragile relationship with the grounders. An artificial intelligence\nnamed A.L.I.E. who was commanded to make life better for mankind is revealed\nto have responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching\nthe nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of\nnearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In\nthe season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E. In the fourth\nseason, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to\ndecades of neglect that will result in 96 percent of the planet becoming\nuninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming\nwave of radiation. When it is discovered that the Grounders with black blood,\nknown as the Nightbloods \u2013 can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others\nattempt to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is\ndiscovered that can protect 1,200 people for over 5 years from the new\napocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the\nbunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the\nremnants of the Ark. However, Clarke, who is now a nightblood remained on the\nEarth's surface alone. In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of\nthe nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot\nleft on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood Grounder who also survived\nthe wave of radiation that swept the planet after the meltdown, have been\nliving. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on\nthe ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley between the prisoners and a new,\nunited clan, known as Wonkru, begins, resulting in a battle ending with the\nvalley being destroyed. The survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep\nwhile they wait for the Earth to recover. In the sixth season, after 125 years\nin cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they\nare no longer orbiting Earth and have been brought to a new habitable world,\nAlpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new\nsociety, led by ruling families known as the Primes. However, they also\ndiscover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as\nthe Children of Gabriel.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n  * Eliza Taylor as Clarke Griffin\n  * Paige Turco as Abigail \"Abby\" Griffin (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Thomas McDonell as Finn Collins (seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Eli Goree as Wells Jaha (season 1; guest season 2)\n  * Marie Avgeropoulos as Octavia Blake\n  * Bob Morley as Bellamy Blake\n  * Kelly Hu as Callie \"Cece\" Cartwig (season 1)\n  * Christopher Larkin as Monty Green (seasons 1\u20135; guest season 6)\n  * Devon Bostick as Jasper Jordan (seasons 1\u20134)\n  * Isaiah Washington as Thelonious Jaha (seasons 1\u20135)\n  * Henry Ian Cusick as Marcus Kane (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Lindsey Morgan as Raven Reyes (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1)\n  * Ricky Whittle as Lincoln (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n  * Richard Harmon as John Murphy (season 3\u2013present; recurring seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Zach McGowan as Roan (season 4; recurring season 3)\n  * Tasya Teles as Echo (season 5\u2013present; recurring season 4; guest seasons 2\u20133)\n  * Shannon Kook as Jordan Green (season 6\u2013present; guest season 5)\n\n### Notes\n\n## Episodes\n\nThe 100 premiered on March 19, 2014. On May 8, 2014, The CW renewed The 100\nfor a second season, which premiered on October 22, 2014. On January 11, 2015,\nThe CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on January 21,\n2016. On March 12, 2016, The 100 was renewed for a fourth season of 13\nepisodes, which premiered on February 1, 2017. On March 10, 2017, The CW\nrenewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on April 24, 2018. On\nMay 9, 2018, the series was renewed for a sixth season, which premiered on\nApril 30, 2019. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a seventh\nseason, that will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced the\nseventh season will be the final season, finishing the show with a total of\n100 episodes across all seven seasons.\n\n## Production\n\nPost production, including ADR recording for the series, was done at the\nrecording studio Cherry Beach Sound. David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki\nand Valyrian for Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for The\nGrounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole English. The\nlanguage is called \"Trig\" on the show. After his constructed language work on\nStar-Crossed, Peterson was contacted by the producers of The 100 to create a\nlanguage for the Grounders, an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years\nhave passed since the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant\nlanguage change. Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in\nwhich the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their speech\nand to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives from that\ncant and evolved over several short generations of survivors of the\napocalypse.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia.\nProduction on the pilot occurred during the second quarter of 2013. After the\nshow was picked up to series, filming occurred for the first season between\nAugust 2013 and January 2014.

Filming for the fourth season\ncommenced on August 2, 2016, and concluded on January 18, 2017. Filming for\nthe fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January 27,\n2018.\n\n### Casting\n\nIn late February 2013, Bob Morley and Eli Goree were cast as Bellamy Blake and\nWells Jaha, respectively, followed a day later by the casting of Henry Ian\nCusick as Marcus Kane. Less than a week later, Eliza Taylor and Marie\nAvgeropoulos were cast in co-starring roles as Clarke Griffin and Octavia\nBlake, respectively.

Its first season has a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with\nan average score of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Although flooded\nwith stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make The 100 a rare high-\nconcept guilty pleasure\". On Metacritic, the first season scores 63 out of 100\npoints, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The\nsecond season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100% on\nRotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 8.08/10. On Metacritic, the season is\nassigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 2 critics. In a review of the\nseason 2 finale, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club said, \"Very few shows manage to\nreally push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels\nlegitimately difficult. Breaking Bad did it. The Sopranos did it. Game of\nThrones has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical\nmurkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, happy ending if it\ndoesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' The 100 has done\nthe same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex\nstakes it's spent a whole season building up\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington\nPost, in another positive review, wrote: \"I can say with some assurance that\nI've rarely seen a program demonstrate the kind of consistency and thematic\ndedication that The 100 has shown in its first two seasons. This is a show\nabout moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been\nlaudably committed to those ideas from Day 1\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the third\nseason received an overall rating of 83% with an average rating of 8.01/10.\nThe Critical consensus is, \"The 100 goes macro in season 3, skillfully\nexpanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape\". On\nMetacritic, the season is assigned a score of 77 out of 100, based on 3\ncritics, indicating generally positive reviews. Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote\nin an early review of the third season: \"When looking at the epic feel and\nvaried array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly\nrecalls \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to\nrecall how limited the scope and the ambitions of \"The 100\" were two years\nago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season\nthree (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more\npolitically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the\ndepiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally\nadmirable\". In a review of the season 3 finale \"Perverse Instantiation: Part\nTwo\", Mariya Karimjee of Vulture.com wrote: \"Every moment of this finale is\npitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing,\nand the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. \"Perverse\nInstantiation: Part Two\" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its\ndisparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four\". In another\nreview of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of The A.V.\nClub wrote: \"Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100,\nit needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it\nwas defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second\nhalf of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink,\nfocusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral\nchoices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays\noff with \"Perverse Instantiation: Part Two,\" a thrilling, forward-thinking\nfinale that provides some necessary closure to this season\". He gave the\nfinale itself an \"A-\" rating. The fourth season is generally considered to be\nan improvement over the third season, receiving a 93% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus\nis, \"Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their\nfavorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their\nthrilling circumstances\". On Metacritic, the season is assigned a score of 80\nout of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating generally positive reviews. The\nsecond portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the\nfirst portion, with the episodes Die All, Die Merrily and Praimfaya often\ncited as the two best episodes of the season. Die All, Die Merrily has a\n9.5/10 rating from IGN, a perfect 5/5 rating from Vulture and a perfect A\nrating from The AV Club. Praimfaya has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from\nThe AV Club. The fifth season currently has a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average of 8.8/10. The critical consensus is, \"Five years in, The 100\nmanages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season.\" This is\nthe highest rating any season of the show has received to date. On Metacritic,\nthe season is assigned a score of 80 out of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating\ngenerally positive reviews. All episodes of the season received highly\npositive reviews, but the third episode Sleeping Giants has received\nparticular high acclaim. In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the episode is\ndescribed as being a \"good ol' fashioned episode of The 100\", praising its\nbalance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The episode also gained a\n4.5/5 rating from TVOverMind, praising the \"pulse-pounding action\" and\napproach to problem solving. Brian Lowry of The Boston Globe said: \"Our\nattraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different\nfuturistic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it\na reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes\". Allison\nKeene of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating: \"The sci-fi\ndrama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only\nby attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space\". Kelly West of\nCinema Blend gave it a more positive review while noting: \"CW's Thrilling New\nSci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more\nwith a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and\nthriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when The 100\nbegins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge\".\nIGN's editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing:\n\"Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, The 100 was a very\nstrong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series\ninto the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring\nseries on TV these days\". Maureen Ryan of Variety named the show one of the\nbest of 2015. In 2016, the year Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list\nof the \"40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time\", the episode \"Thirteen\"\nattracted criticism when Lexa, one of the series' LGBT characters, was killed\noff. Critics and fans considered the death a continuation of a persistent\ntrope in television in which LGBT characters are killed off far more often\nthan others \u2013 implicitly portraying them as disposable, as existing only to\nserve the stories of straight characters, or to attract viewers.

      "# The Surplus\n\n\"The Surplus\" is the tenth episode of the fifth season of the television\nseries The Office, and the show's eighty-second episode overall. The episode\naired in the United States on December 4, 2008 on NBC. In this episode, the\noffice is at odds over whether to spend a budget surplus on new chairs or a\nnew photocopier, with Jim, Pam, and Oscar in particular trying to convince\nMichael how to spend the money. Meanwhile, Andy and Angela visit Schrute Farms\nto discuss their wedding plans.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nOscar (Oscar Nunez) informs Michael (Steve Carell) that the office must spend\na $4300 surplus or lose it in next year's budget. When Michael opens up the\nfloor for suggestions, factions break out and officemates square off against\none another in order to get what they want. Oscar suggests that they replace\nthe copier while Pam (Jenna Fischer) suggests they buy new chairs and Toby\n(Paul Lieberstein) suggests that they get the air quality in the office tested\nsaying that there is radon coming from downstairs and asbestos coming from the\nceiling. Jim (John Krasinski) takes Oscar's side, much to Pam's shock, because\nhe started making copies himself since he and Pam started dating (asking Pam\nto make copies makes him feel awkward) and knows how bad the copier is, while\nthe rest of the employees side with Pam. Pam notices the copier malfunctioning\nwhen she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs. Michael does not\nchoose a side, because he does not want to be the bad guy, so both sides start\nwarming up to him to win him over. Jim and Oscar take Michael out for lunch,\nwhile Pam puts on more make-up and starts to hit on Michael. Meanwhile, Angela\n(Angela Kinsey) and Andy (Ed Helms) visit Schrute Farms to discuss wedding\nplans with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with\nDwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela's father. An Amish minister who\nonly speaks German plays the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight\ngoes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on\nAngela's finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears\nto be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting\ntogether with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the\nmock wedding was an actual wedding since Andy technically acted as their\nwitness and the supposedly fake minister was actually marrying them in German.\nHe tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on\nhis farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately\nkisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to\ntake care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).\nMichael still remains indecisive regarding what to buy, so he brings in a\nthird party: Hank (Hugh Dane) the security guard. However, Hank is more\ninterested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael\ncalls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that\nhe has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting\npaid a bonus equal to 15% of it. Michael then tells the employees that he is\nnot going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar realizes that\nMichael now knows about the 3rd option (Michael immediately says \"645 dollars\"\nwhen Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is but struggles to calculate 15% of\n200). Michael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees'\nintrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that\nthey will be unable to come to a consensus by the day's end and enable him to\ntake the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced\ninstead of remaining deadlocked, which upsets Michael. Later Michael is shown\nwearing a fur coat he had bought in anticipation of receiving the bonus, which\nhad fake blood thrown on it by activists. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try\nto get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, telling him that he\nis on \"dangerous ground\". Pam is nasty towards Jim during the entire debate,\nwhich Jim seems more easygoing about. However, at the end of the episode, Jim\ngets back at Pam for winning the debate by reverting to his earlier practice\nof having Pam make copies for him.\n\n## Reception\n\n\"The Surplus\" was voted the eighth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the\nfifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the\nepisode was rated 8.42 out of 10.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * This episode begins Ryan Howard's 11-episode absence from the office, as he went on vacation. He would return in \"Dream Team\".\n  * According to the commentary on this episode, B. J. Novak says that he was going to co-star in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds which is why his character is going to Thailand.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Surplus\" at NBC.com\n\n",

She married Andrew Barry in 1767 at the age of\n15 and lived on Walnut Grove Plantation in Roebuck, South Carolina during the\n18th century. She was instrumental in helping to warn the militia of the\ncoming British before the Battle of Cowpens in 1781. According to legend, she\ntied her toddler to the bedpost while she rode out to warn neighbors that the\nBritish were coming. Her warning helped to prepare the colonial forces to\ndefeat the British governor, Cornwallis and his men and drive them north, out\nof the state of South Carolina. She is buried in the family cemetery in Moore,\nSouth Carolina, beside her husband, Andrew, who was one of the first elders of\nthe Nazareth Presbyterian Church. She knew the Indian trails and shortcuts\nwhere almost no patriots lived. Barry was a spy and message bearer for the\nmilitia when the Battle of Cowpens was fought on January 17, 1781. The Battle\nof Cowpens (January 17, 1781) was a decisive victory by Continental army\nforces under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, in the Southern campaign of the\nAmerican Revolutionary War. It was a turning point in the reconquest of South\nCarolina from the British. Kate Barry was an ancestor of the actress Amanda\nBlake (1929-1989), remembered for the role of the red-haired saloon\nproprietress \"Miss Kitty Russell\" on the television western Gunsmoke.

      "# The 100 (TV series)\n\nThe 100 (pronounced The Hundred) is an American post-apocalyptic science\nfiction drama television series that premiered on March 19, 2014, on The CW.\nThe series, developed by Jason Rothenberg, is loosely based on the novel\nseries of the same name by Kass Morgan. The series follows a group of post-\napocalyptic survivors, chiefly a group of criminal adolescents, including\nClarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake\n(Bob Morley), Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon\nBostick), Monty Green (Christopher Larkin), Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), John\nMurphy (Richard Harmon), and Wells Jaha (Eli Goree). They are among the first\npeople from a space habitat, the Ark, to return to Earth after a devastating\nnuclear apocalypse. Other lead characters include Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige\nTurco), Clarke's mother; Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a council member on\nthe Ark; and Thelonious Jaha (Isaiah Washington), the Chancellor of the Ark\nand Wells's father. In April 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh\nseason, which will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced\nthat the series will conclude with the seventh season.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe setting is 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out\nalmost all life on Earth. Thousands of people live in a space station orbiting\nEarth, which they call the Ark, constructed of connecting space stations and\nspacecraft. Three generations have been born in space, bringing the population\nof the Ark beyond carrying capacity. The future is jeopardized by over-\npopulation. 100 juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to\ndetermine whether it is habitable. They discover that some survived the\napocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the\nReapers, another group of Grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the\nMountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from\nthose who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership\nof Bellamy and Clarke, the 100 attempt to survive the harsh surface\nconditions, battle hostile Grounders and establish communication with the Ark.\nIn the second season, 48 of the remaining 100 are captured and taken to Mount\nWeather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men\nare transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment\nas their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on\nEarth. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation\nefficacy: their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside\ncontainment. The inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on\nEarth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people,\nnaming the main settlement at Alpha Station \"Camp Jaha\". In the third season,\nAlpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former\nteacher, and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with\nthe Grounders. Pike uses very dangerous methods, which further damages their\nalready fragile relationship with the grounders. An artificial intelligence\nnamed A.L.I.E. who was commanded to make life better for mankind is revealed\nto have responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching\nthe nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of\nnearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In\nthe season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E. In the fourth\nseason, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to\ndecades of neglect that will result in 96 percent of the planet becoming\nuninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming\nwave of radiation. When it is discovered that the Grounders with black blood,\nknown as the Nightbloods \u2013 can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others\nattempt to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is\ndiscovered that can protect 1,200 people for over 5 years from the new\napocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the\nbunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the\nremnants of the Ark. However, Clarke, who is now a nightblood remained on the\nEarth's surface alone. In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of\nthe nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot\nleft on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood Grounder who also survived\nthe wave of radiation that swept the planet after the meltdown, have been\nliving. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on\nthe ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley between the prisoners and a new,\nunited clan, known as Wonkru, begins, resulting in a battle ending with the\nvalley being destroyed. The survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep\nwhile they wait for the Earth to recover. In the sixth season, after 125 years\nin cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they\nare no longer orbiting Earth and have been brought to a new habitable world,\nAlpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new\nsociety, led by ruling families known as the Primes. However, they also\ndiscover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as\nthe Children of Gabriel.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n  * Eliza Taylor as Clarke Griffin\n  * Paige Turco as Abigail \"Abby\" Griffin (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Thomas McDonell as Finn Collins (seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Eli Goree as Wells Jaha (season 1; guest season 2)\n  * Marie Avgeropoulos as Octavia Blake\n  * Bob Morley as Bellamy Blake\n  * Kelly Hu as Callie \"Cece\" Cartwig (season 1)\n  * Christopher Larkin as Monty Green (seasons 1\u20135; guest season 6)\n  * Devon Bostick as Jasper Jordan (seasons 1\u20134)\n  * Isaiah Washington as Thelonious Jaha (seasons 1\u20135)\n  * Henry Ian Cusick as Marcus Kane (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Lindsey Morgan as Raven Reyes (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1)\n  * Ricky Whittle as Lincoln (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n  * Richard Harmon as John Murphy (season 3\u2013present; recurring seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Zach McGowan as Roan (season 4; recurring season 3)\n  * Tasya Teles as Echo (season 5\u2013present; recurring season 4; guest seasons 2\u20133)\n  * Shannon Kook as Jordan Green (season 6\u2013present; guest season 5)\n\n### Notes\n\n## Episodes\n\nThe 100 premiered on March 19, 2014. On May 8, 2014, The CW renewed The 100\nfor a second season, which premiered on October 22, 2014. On January 11, 2015,\nThe CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on January 21,\n2016. On March 12, 2016, The 100 was renewed for a fourth season of 13\nepisodes, which premiered on February 1, 2017. On March 10, 2017, The CW\nrenewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on April 24, 2018. On\nMay 9, 2018, the series was renewed for a sixth season, which premiered on\nApril 30, 2019. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a seventh\nseason, that will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced the\nseventh season will be the final season, finishing the show with a total of\n100 episodes across all seven seasons.\n\n## Production\n\nPost production, including ADR recording for the series, was done at the\nrecording studio Cherry Beach Sound. David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki\nand Valyrian for Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for The\nGrounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole English. The\nlanguage is called \"Trig\" on the show. After his constructed language work on\nStar-Crossed, Peterson was contacted by the producers of The 100 to create a\nlanguage for the Grounders, an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years\nhave passed since the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant\nlanguage change. Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in\nwhich the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their speech\nand to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives from that\ncant and evolved over several short generations of survivors of the\napocalypse.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia.\nProduction on the pilot occurred during the second quarter of 2013. After the\nshow was picked up to series, filming occurred for the first season between\nAugust 2013 and January 2014.

Filming for\nthe fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January 27,\n2018.\n\n### Casting\n\nIn late February 2013, Bob Morley and Eli Goree were cast as Bellamy Blake and\nWells Jaha, respectively, followed a day later by the casting of Henry Ian\nCusick as Marcus Kane. Less than a week later, Eliza Taylor and Marie\nAvgeropoulos were cast in co-starring roles as Clarke Griffin and Octavia\nBlake, respectively.

Season 3\npremiered on February 17, 2016. In Australia, The 100 was originally scheduled\nto premiere on Go! but instead premiered on Fox8 on September 4, 2014. Season\n2 premiered on January 8, 2015.\n\n## Home media\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a 92% average approval rating across its 6\nseasons. Its first season has a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with\nan average score of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Although flooded\nwith stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make The 100 a rare high-\nconcept guilty pleasure\". On Metacritic, the first season scores 63 out of 100\npoints, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The\nsecond season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100% on\nRotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 8.08/10. On Metacritic, the season is\nassigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 2 critics. In a review of the\nseason 2 finale, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club said, \"Very few shows manage to\nreally push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels\nlegitimately difficult. Breaking Bad did it. The Sopranos did it. Game of\nThrones has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical\nmurkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, happy ending if it\ndoesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' The 100 has done\nthe same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex\nstakes it's spent a whole season building up\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington\nPost, in another positive review, wrote: \"I can say with some assurance that\nI've rarely seen a program demonstrate the kind of consistency and thematic\ndedication that The 100 has shown in its first two seasons. This is a show\nabout moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been\nlaudably committed to those ideas from Day 1\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the third\nseason received an overall rating of 83% with an average rating of 8.01/10.\nThe Critical consensus is, \"The 100 goes macro in season 3, skillfully\nexpanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape\". On\nMetacritic, the season is assigned a score of 77 out of 100, based on 3\ncritics, indicating generally positive reviews. Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote\nin an early review of the third season: \"When looking at the epic feel and\nvaried array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly\nrecalls \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to\nrecall how limited the scope and the ambitions of \"The 100\" were two years\nago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season\nthree (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more\npolitically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the\ndepiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally\nadmirable\". In a review of the season 3 finale \"Perverse Instantiation: Part\nTwo\", Mariya Karimjee of Vulture.com wrote: \"Every moment of this finale is\npitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing,\nand the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. \"Perverse\nInstantiation: Part Two\" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its\ndisparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four\". In another\nreview of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of The A.V.\nClub wrote: \"Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100,\nit needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it\nwas defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second\nhalf of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink,\nfocusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral\nchoices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays\noff with \"Perverse Instantiation: Part Two,\" a thrilling, forward-thinking\nfinale that provides some necessary closure to this season\". He gave the\nfinale itself an \"A-\" rating. The fourth season is generally considered to be\nan improvement over the third season, receiving a 93% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus\nis, \"Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their\nfavorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their\nthrilling circumstances\". On Metacritic, the season is assigned a score of 80\nout of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating generally positive reviews. The\nsecond portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the\nfirst portion, with the episodes Die All, Die Merrily and Praimfaya often\ncited as the two best episodes of the season. Die All, Die Merrily has a\n9.5/10 rating from IGN, a perfect 5/5 rating from Vulture and a perfect A\nrating from The AV Club. Praimfaya has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from\nThe AV Club. The fifth season currently has a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average of 8.8/10. The critical consensus is, \"Five years in, The 100\nmanages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season.\" This is\nthe highest rating any season of the show has received to date. On Metacritic,\nthe season is assigned a score of 80 out of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating\ngenerally positive reviews. All episodes of the season received highly\npositive reviews, but the third episode Sleeping Giants has received\nparticular high acclaim. In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the episode is\ndescribed as being a \"good ol' fashioned episode of The 100\", praising its\nbalance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The episode also gained a\n4.5/5 rating from TVOverMind, praising the \"pulse-pounding action\" and\napproach to problem solving. Brian Lowry of The Boston Globe said: \"Our\nattraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different\nfuturistic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it\na reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes\". Allison\nKeene of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating: \"The sci-fi\ndrama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only\nby attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space\". Kelly West of\nCinema Blend gave it a more positive review while noting: \"CW's Thrilling New\nSci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more\nwith a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and\nthriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when The 100\nbegins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge\".\nIGN's editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing:\n\"Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, The 100 was a very\nstrong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series\ninto the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring\nseries on TV these days\". Maureen Ryan of Variety named the show one of the\nbest of 2015. In 2016, the year Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list\nof the \"40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time\", the episode \"Thirteen\"\nattracted criticism when Lexa, one of the series' LGBT characters, was killed\noff. Critics and fans considered the death a continuation of a persistent\ntrope in television in which LGBT characters are killed off far more often\nthan others \u2013 implicitly portraying them as disposable, as existing only to\nserve the stories of straight characters, or to attract viewers. A widespread\ndebate among writers and fans about the trope ensued, with Lexa's death cited\nas a prime example of the trope, and why it should end. Showrunner Jason\nRothenberg eventually wrote in response that \"I (...) write and produce\ntelevision for the real world where negative and hurtful tropes exist. And I\nam very sorry for not recognizing this as fully as I should have\".\n\n### Ratings\n\nAn estimated 2.7million American viewers watched the series premiere, which\nreceived an 18\u201349 rating of 0.9, making it the most-watched show in its time\nslot on The CW since 2010, with the series Life Unexpected.\n\n### Accolades\n\n## Prequel series\n\nIn October 2019, it was confirmed Rothenberg was developing a The 100 prequel\nseries for The CW. It was reported that a backdoor pilot episode had been\nordered, which will air as an episode of the seventh and final season of The\n100. The prequel series is set to show the events 97 years before the original\nseries, beginning with the nuclear apocalypse that wiped out almost all life\non Earth.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Parliament of Ghana\n\nThe Parliament of Ghana is the legislative body of the Government of Ghana.\n\n## History\n\nLegislative representation in Ghana dates back to 1950, when the country was a\nBritish colony known as Gold Coast. The body, called the Legislative Council,\nwas purely advisory as the Governor exercised all legislative and executive\npowers. Reforms were introduced in 1916 and 1925, although the governor's\npower remained extensive. In 1946, a new constitution was introduced that\nallowed for an unofficial member of the Legislative Council to become its\npresident while the governor ceased to be the ex officio president of the\nbody. This system continued until 1951 when the Legislature elected its first\nSpeaker - Sir Emmanuel Charles Quist. 1951 was also the first year that\nelections based on universal suffrage were held. The Convention People's Party\n(CPP), which was formed in 1949 and led by Kwame Nkrumah, won the election.\nAnother party, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) led by J.B. Danquah,\nfared poorly, and was disbanded soon after. Nkrumah, who had been jailed in\nearly 1950 for subversion, was released and appointed Leader of Government\nBusiness, becoming the country's first Prime Minister the following year.\nLegislative Assembly elections held in 1954 resulted in another CPP victory,\nwith the party winning 71 out of a total of 104 seats. It also won 71 out of\n104 seats in the 1956 Legislative Assembly election. The Gold Coast was\nrenamed Ghana and granted independence on 6 March 1957, while retaining the\nBritish monarch as head of state. The Legislative Assembly was renamed\nNational Assembly. After the approval of a new Republican constitution, Ghana\nofficially became a republic on 1 July 1960 with Kwame Nkrumah as its\nPresident. The plebiscite was taken as a fresh mandate from the people and the\nterms of National Assembly members were extended for another five years. A\none-party state was introduced following a referendum in 1964. As a result,\nonly CPP candidates stood in the National Assembly Election held in 1965.\nNkrumah was overthrown in 1966 by the military, which banned political parties\nand dissolved the National Assembly. The country returned to civilian rule in\n1969. Elections held on 29 August resulted in victory for the Progress Party\n(PP) of Kofi Abrefa Busia, which won 105 of the National Assembly's 140 seats.\nHe took office as Prime Minister on 3 September 1969. His government was\ntoppled in a 1972 military coup. During the Third Republic, which lasted from\n1979 to 1981, the dominant party in the National Assembly was the People's\nNational Party (PNP), which won 71 out of 104 seats in elections held on 18\nJune 1979. After the military intervened in 1981, all elected institutions\nwere dissolved and political party activity was prohibited.\n\n## Parliament of the Fourth Republic\n\nAfter 11 years of military rule, a new constitution was approved in a 1992\nreferendum. Presidential elections were held in November and were won by Jerry\nRawlings, leader of the 1981 coup and subsequent military ruler. The\nopposition contested the results and boycotted the December parliamentary\nelections. As a result, Rawlings' National Democratic Congress (NDC) won 189\nout of 200 seats in Parliament. All parties participated in the 1996\nparliamentary elections. The NDC won 133 out of a total of 200 seats, while\nthe main opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) won 60. Two small parties won\nthe remaining seats. The 2000 elections were significant in that President\nRawlings was constitutionally barred from seeking another term. In the\npresidential poll, John Kufuor of the NPP defeated the NDC candidate John Atta\nMills in a run-off election. In the 200-seat Parliament, the NPP won 100,\nfollowed by the NDC's 92. Small political parties and independents won the\nremaining seats. Kufuor was re-elected in 2004 and the New Patriotic Party\n(NPP) won 128 out of 230 seats in the concurrent parliamentary election. The\nmain opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) won 94, while two other\nparties - The People's National Convention (PNC) and Convention People's Party\n(CPP) - won 4 and 3 seats, respectively. An Independent captured the remaining\nseat. The simple majority (or First Past the Post) voting system is used in\nGhana's parliamentary elections. Since 2012, the country is divided into 275\nsingle-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\n### Leadership structure\n\n  * Speaker - The Speaker presides over the Parliament and enforces observance of all rules that govern its conduct. After a general election the majority party in Parliament, in consultation with other parties, nominates a Speaker.\n\nThe Speaker cannot be a Member of Parliament though he/she must possess the\nqualifications to stand for elections as a Member of Parliament, such person\non appointment as Speaker must resign and declare the seat occupied in\nParliament as vacant. The Speaker is assisted by two Deputy Speakers (First\nand Second Deputy Speakers), who are elected at the commencement of every\nParliament. They must come from different political parties. The current\nSpeaker is Prof. Aaron Mike Ocquaye former MP for Dome-Kwabenya constituency\nof Ghana.\n\n  * First Deputy Speaker - The First Deputy Speaker presides over the sittings of Parliament whenever the Speaker is absent. The current First Deputy Speaker is Joseph Osei Owusu of the New Patriotic Party (NPP).\n  * Second Deputy Speaker - The Second Deputy Speaker presides over the sittings of Parliament in the absence of the Speaker and the First Deputy Speaker. The current Second Deputy Speaker is Alban Bagbin of the National Democratic Congress (NDC).\n  * Majority Leader - The Majority Leader is elected from the party with a majority of parliamentary seats. A deputy majority leader and a majority chief whip assist him, constituting the majority leadership of Parliament. The current Majority Leader is Osei Kyei-Mensah Bonsu of the NPP.\n  * Minority Leader - The Minority leader is elected from the second largest party in Parliament. A deputy minority leader and a chief whip assist him, constituting the minority leadership of Parliament. The current Minority Leader is Haruna Iddrisu of the NDC.\n\n### 2008 elections\n\n### Composition Parliament in 2016\n\n## 2012 elections\n\n## Past Speakers of the National Assembly/Parliament\n\n### Gold Coast (1951 \u2013 1957)\n\nSpeaker of the Legislative Assembly, and National Assembly in 1957  \n\n### Independent State within the Commonwealth (1957 \u2013 1960) / First Republic\n(1960 \u2013 1966)\n\nSpeakers of the National Assembly  \n\n### Second Republic (1969 \u2013 1972)\n\nSpeaker of the National Assembly  \n\n### Third Republic (1979 \u2013 1981)\n\nSpeaker of the National Assembly  \n\n### Fourth Republic (1992 \u2013 present)\n\nSpeakers of Parliament  \n\n## Members of parliament\n\n  * For a list of current members, see MPs elected in the Ghanaian parliamentary election, 2012.\n\nThe composition of the Parliament has changed over the years.

      "# Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana\n\nThe Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana is the presiding officer of the\nParliament of Ghana. The current speaker is Mike Oquaye. He was elected on 7\nJanuary 2017.\n\n## History\n\nThe first speaker of the Parliament of Ghana was Sir Emmanuel Charles Quist\nwho was Speaker of the National Assembly from independence on 6 March 1957\nuntil December 1957. Prior to Ghana's independence, the Governor of Ghana\npresided over the legislative council. This changed in 1949 when Emmanuel\nQuist became its first African president. The Legislative Council elected\nQuist as its first speaker in 1951. The longest serving speaker was Daniel\nFrancis Annan who served from 7 January 1993 to 6 January 2001. In January\n2009, Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo became the first lady to be speaker of the\nGhanaian parliament.\n\n## Appointment and office tenure\n\nArticle 95 of the 1992 Ghana constitution provides for the election of a\nspeaker from among the members of parliament or from persons who are qualified\nto be members of parliament. Where the speaker is elected from among the\nmembers of parliament, Article 97 of the constitution specifies that the\nspeaker vacates his or her seat in parliament, triggering a by-election. The\nonly person to have been in this position so far is Edward Adjaho who was the\nelected member for the then Akatsi South constituency.\n\n## Deputy Speaker\n\nThere are two deputy speakers who are elected from among the members of\nparliament by the members. Both deputy speakers cannot be from the same\npolitical party. The current deputy speakers are the MP for Bekwai, Joseph\nOsei-Owusu, of the National Patriotic Party and MP for Nadawli West, Alban\nBagbin of the National Democratic Congress.\n\n## Role\n\nArticle 101 of the Ghana constitution stipulates that the speaker presides at\nall sittings of parliament. Where the speaker is not able to do so, one of the\ntwo deputies presides. No parliamentary business can take place without the\nspeaker in the chair. The speaker also takes precedence over all people in\nGhana except the President of Ghana and the Vice President. In view of this,\nthe speaker may act on behalf of the president if neither the president nor\nthe vice president is able to do so. The constitution stipulates that there\nshould be an election within three months of the speaker assuming the\npresidency due to the death or removal of the president and vice president.\nThe speaker does not have a vote in parliament. This means that when the votes\nare tied, the motion is lost. The speaker is also the chairman of the\nparliamentary service board. The speaker also appoints four additional members\nto this board. The sixth member of the board is the Clerk of Parliament.\n\n## Past Speakers\n\n## See also\n\n  * Parliament of Ghana\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Parliament of Ghana official website\n\n",
      "# Joyce Bamford-Addo\n\nJoyce Adeline Bamford-Addo, (born 26 March 1937) was the Speaker of the\nParliament of Ghana from 2009 to 2013. The Speaker's position is the third\nmost important in Ghana. She previously served as a Supreme Court Judge. She\nwas also the first female Speaker in such a position in the West African sub-\nregion. Her active campaign for women's empowerment was demonstrated in many\nworkshops.\n\n## Early life and education\n\nBorn in 1937 to an English father and a Ghanian mother from Aburi, Joyce\nBamford-Addo attended St. Mary\u2019s Boarding School and OLA Boarding School along\nwith her sister Cynthia in Cape Coast for her basic education. She\nsubsequently attended Holy Child School, also in Cape Coast for her secondary\neducation. She proceeded to the United Kingdom for legal training. She joined\nthe Inner Temple to train under the apprenticeship system known as Inns of\ncourt and was called to the English Bar in 1961.\n\n## Judicial service\n\nBamford-Addo returned to Ghana after working in the UK for a year. She was\ncalled to the Ghana Bar in 1962. She worked as a State Attorney from 1963 and\nrose to become Chief State Attorney in 1973. She was appointed Director of\nPublic Prosecutions in 1976, a position she held for 10 years. She was also\nappointed by Jerry Rawlings as a Supreme Court Judge in 1991. She retired from\nthe Supreme Court in October 2004 when she was bypassed, allegedly, for her\njunior, Justice George Kingsley Acquah, in the appointment of Chief Justice.\n\n## Politics\n\nIn 1991, Bamford-Addo became the Second Deputy Speaker of Ghana's Consultative\nAssembly, set up to draft what became the 1992 constitution. Following the\n2008 presidential and parliamentary elections, she was elected unopposed as\nthe Speaker of the Fourth Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Profile on Parliament of Ghana website\n\n",

      "# Jimmy John's\n\nJimmy John's Franchise, LLC is an American franchised sandwich fast food\nrestaurant chain, specializing in delivery. It was founded by Jimmy John\nLiautaud in 1983 and is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois. In 35 years, the\ncompany has grown to more than 2,800 locations in all states except Alaska,\nConnecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. , 98% of\nthe locations are franchise-owned.\n\n## History\n\nAfter Jimmy John Liautaud graduated second to last in his class at Elgin\nAcademy (1982), his father gave him the choice to join the military or start a\nbusiness. Liautaud chose the latter, and his father lent him $25,000 to start\na hot dog business, with the son owning 52% of the business, and his father\nowning 48%. He soon realized that a hot dog business would cost more than he\nhad, so he decided to open a sandwich shop. On January 13, 1983, the first\nJimmy John's opened in a garage in Charleston, Illinois. Paying $200 a month\nin rent, Liautaud could only afford used equipment consisting of a\nrefrigerator, a chest freezer, an oven, and a meat slicer. The store was able\nto realize a profit its first year of business, despite the poor location of\nthe store, due to Jimmy John's willingness to deliver his sandwiches to the\nnearby dorms at Eastern Illinois University, as well as his handing out free\nsamples for marketing purposes. In April 1985, Liautaud bought out his\nfather's interest in the business, becoming the sole owner. In 1986, he opened\nhis second store in Macomb, Illinois, and in 1987, he opened a third in\nChampaign, Illinois. In 1988, Liautaud met Jamie Coulter, who would later\nbecome the CEO of Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon. Coulter mentored Liautaud and\n\"taught [him] how to effectively run multiple units.\" Liautaud continued\nopening more stores and developed a prototype before beginning franchising in\n1994. Franchising continued until 2002 when Liautaud stopped selling\nfranchises for one year to give support for stores that were struggling. The\nfirst franchise store opened in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In 2001, the hundredth\nJimmy John's store opened in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. In 2007, the five-\nhundredth store opened in Seattle, Washington, and in 2010, the thousandth\nopened in Beaverton, Oregon. As of March 2017, Jimmy John's has almost 3,000\nstores with plans for expansion up to 5,000 and beyond. CNNMoney listed Jimmy\nJohn's as one of ten \"Great Franchise Bets.\" The company estimates that annual\nsales can be as high as $1.2 million while net profits can average at about\n$280,000. Real estate start-up costs are estimated to be between $305,000 and\n$485,500. Liautaud realized that in order to grow he would need help acquiring\nbetter locations for his stores. Since he had little expertise in real estate,\nhe decided to take on a partner who did. In January 2007, Liautaud sold a 33%\nstake to Weston Presidio, a San Francisco\u2013based private-equity firm. In the\nfirst year after partnering with Weston Presidio, 100 real estate deals were\nclosed. The company has completed two recapitalizations since Weston\nPresidio's investment. In the summer of 2015, pictures of Liautaud posing with\nbig game circulated on social media, leading to increased calls to boycott his\nrestaurants. In an interview in 2015 with the Chicago Tribune, Liautaud said,\n\"I don't hunt big African game anymore.\" In September 2016, Jimmy John's\nannounced that Roark Capital Group had agreed to acquire a majority stake in\nthe company. Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed, though\nit was later clarified that Liautaud retained 35% ownership of the company as\npart of the deal. As part of the agreement, the company's founder and largest\nindividual shareholder Jimmy John Liautaud will continue as chairman of the\nboard. On September 25, 2019, Inspire Brands announced that it was buying\nJimmy John's for an unspecified amount in a deal unanimously approved by\nLiautaud and the rest of the Jimmy John's Board of Directors. At the close of\nthe deal, Liautaud will step down as chairman of the company and transition to\nbecome an adviser to the brand. The acquisition was completed on October 18.\n\n### Labor relations\n\nIn 2010, when the Industrial Workers of the World attempted to unionize ten\nMinneapolis locations, The New York Times called the effort \"one of the few\nefforts to organize fast-food workers in American history.\" In July 2017, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that the National\nLabor Relations Act did not protect Jimmy John's employees from being fired\nfor exhibiting legally disloyal conduct by attacking the company's product to\noppose a franchisee's sick leave policy. In October 2014, it was revealed that\nemployees at Jimmy John's, including sandwich makers and delivery drivers,\nwere required to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of employment. The\nagreement restricted the employee from working for a competitor for two years,\nwhere a competitor was defined as a business which derives more than ten\npercent of its revenue from selling sandwiches and is located within three\nmiles of any Jimmy John's. Additionally, the employee could not work for\nanother Jimmy John's franchisee for a year. Jimmy John's has since settled\nlawsuits filed by the Attorneys General of New York And Illinois on this\nmatter. In statements, the company clarified that it had taken steps to remove\nnon-compete agreements from their new hire paperwork long before they were\ncontacted by the Attorneys General, and that \"Enforcement of non-compete\nagreements against our own hourly store employees is not a part of Jimmy\nJohn\u2019s culture or business model.\"\n\n## Awards\n\nJimmy John's was named #1 on the Entrepreneur 2016 Franchise 500. In 2014,\nYouGov BrandIndex ranked restaurant chains that have the highest millennial\nbrand loyalty, and Jimmy John's topped the ranking with 83% of the vote based\non restaurants they would consider going to again. Jimmy John's was named the\n#2 Most Popular Restaurant for Business Meals by expense reporting program\nCertify. In 2015, Entrepreneur.com named Jimmy John's one of the 10 Promising\nFranchises for Ambitious Entrepreneurs. In March 2017, Jimmy John's won\nFranchise Times' \"Deal of the Year\" for attracting Roark Capital Group as the\ncompany's new majority owner. FT's judges called the deal \"one of the best\nprivate equity deals of all time in the restaurant business.\"\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nIn September 2014, Jimmy John's donated $1 million to the Folds of Honor\nFoundation, a foundation which supports the families of killed or disabled\nsoldiers. During the 2015 school year, Jimmy John's donated more than 100\nlaptop computers to the Champaign Unit 4 School District. Jimmy John's donated\n$125,000 to the Champaign Parks Foundation to support the Youth Scholarship\nProgram in November 2016. In June 2017, Jimmy John's donated $100,000 to EAT\n(RED) SAVE LIVES to offer HIV/AIDS medication in sub-Saharan Africa. In\nDecember 2018, Jimmy John's donated $80,000 to pay off all Christmas layaways\nat Walmarts in Champaign, Urbana, and Savoy.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nStarting in 2007, Jimmy John's began sponsoring NASCAR, first with Steven\nWallace in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 and 2010, Jimmy John's sponsored Kevin\nHarvick in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. In 2011, Jimmy John's and Richard\nChildress Racing reached a multi-year agreement to sponsor Harvick for the\nSprint Cup Series. The 2014 sponsorship continued with Harvick and the\nStewart-Haas Racing team. On September 13, 2014, Jimmy John's became the title\nsponsor of the Jimmy John's Freaky Fast 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. Harvick\nwon the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship, giving Jimmy John's their first\nchampionship. In 2010, Jimmy John's entered an Ultimate Fighting Championship\nsponsorship with Brock Lesnar with logos appearing on his trunks. This\nsponsorship extended to WWE upon Lesnar's return to that company in 2012,\nmaking him the only WWE performer in history to be permitted such a deal. In\n2015, Jimmy John's co-sponsored the RCH Factory Racing Supercross and\nMotocross team featuring Ken Roczen. The team contested both the Monster\nEnergy AMA Supercross and the Lucas Oil Pro Motocross championships. In June,\nJimmy John's sponsored former NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace for his Speed\nEnergy Formula Off-Road debut at the 2015 X Games. In June 2015, it was\nannounced that Jimmy John's purchased the naming rights to the Utica, Michigan\nbaseball stadium which is the current home of the three teams in the newly\nformed United Shore Professional Baseball League. Jimmy John's Field opened on\nMay 30, 2016. Other Jimmy John's sponsorships include the Boston Red Sox,\nChicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Houston Astros, Nashville Predators,\nSt. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners and the GoDaddy.com Bowl among many\nothers. Jimmy John's owners have also supported local organizations in their\ncommunities.

      "# Inside Out (1986 film)\n\nInside Out is a 1986 American drama film directed by Robert Taicher, written\nby Robert Taicher and Kevin Bartelme and starring Elliott Gould, Howard\nHesseman and Jennifer Tilly.\n\n## Plot\n\nJimmy Morgan, a financially successful entrepreneur, is watching his financial\nand personal life collapse around him as he sits in his posh New York City\napartment. His estranged wife reveals her plan to leave with his daughter for\nChicago. In the meantime, Morgan's stock market portfolio evaporates in a bad\nmarket, his business partner Leo Gross is embezzling money entrusted to their\nbusiness for himself, and Morgan is gambling (and losing) on professional\nfootball games in larger and larger amounts. Morgan orders food, prostitutes,\nand drugs over the telephone or (later in the film) using his computer and a\nmodem. His television is on almost nonstop. As friends visit, Morgan is\nrevealed to be an agoraphobe, and cannot seem to find the courage to leave his\napartment even when doing so may save him financially or personally. He\nwatches the world through his television, video cameras pointed out past his\napartment door, and through his windows. Morgan's answering machine is as much\nthe center of his world as his television, used to carefully screen calls and\npeople. Gross, his business partner, assures him that the temporary business\nlosses will be ironed out, and that if Morgan is unavailable to solve the\nproblem, he will be happy to do so on his behalf. In reality, he is\nredirecting this money for himself, and using Morgan's agoraphobia to his\nadvantage. Meanwhile, Morgan, who gambles on National Football League games\ncasually, has begun to bet more and more on these games to cover quickly\nmounting losses. Friends make efforts to help Jimmy and even to get him to\nleave the house, but begin to drift away the deeper he digs himself into his\napartment. He finds himself truly alone as they give up, frustrated. Jimmy\nmakes a friendship over his apartment intercom with a homeless person that\nsleeps in the entryway. He occasionally orders food for the man over the\ncourse of days to weeks. Eventually the man disappears as quietly as he\narrived. Finances become desperate as Morgan's savings disappear, and gambling\nlosses destroy what little money Morgan has left. He is left in an empty\napartment with only his answering machine, after all his possessions are\nforeclosed upon. Only in this final desperate situation does Morgan finally\nbuild the courage to leave his apartment to begin anew, and to contact his\nwife and daughter before they leave for Chicago.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Elliott Gould as Jimmy Morgan\n  * Howard Hesseman as Jack\n  * Jennifer Tilly as Amy\n  * Beah Richards as Verna\n  * Dana Elcar as Leo Gross\n  * Timothy Scott as The Homeless Guy\n  * Sandy McPeak as Lewis Curlson\n  * Nicole Nourmand as Heather\n  * John Bleifer as Hyman\n  * Robert Miranda as Sal\n  * Meshach Taylor as Freddy\n  * Kathleen Freeman as Mother (voice)\n\n## Release\n\nInside Out was filmed in 1985.

      "# Baby mama\n\nA baby mama (also baby-mama and baby-mother) is a mother who is not married to\nher child's father, although the term is often infused with other meanings as\nwell.\n\n## Origin\n\nThe term originated in Jamaican Creole as \"baby-mother\" (pronounced ), with\nthe first printed usage appearing in the Kingston newspaper, The Daily Gleaner\nin 1966. Another Daily Gleaner use dates from November 21, 1989. Originally,\nthe term was used by the fathers of illegitimate children to describe the\nmothers of their children, but the term is now in general use to describe any\nsingle mother. Peter L. Patrick, a linguistics professor who studies Jamaican\nEnglish, has said of the terms baby mother and baby father, \"[they] definitely\nimply there is not a marriage\u2014not even a common-law marriage, but rather that\nthe child is an 'outside' child\". Since entering currency in U.S. tabloids,\nthe terms baby mama and baby daddy have even begun to be applied to married\nand engaged celebrities.\n\n## Usage\n\n### In music\n\nBaby mother and baby mama had entered wide use in American hip-hop lyrics by\nthe mid-1990s. One of the first representations of baby mamas in hip-hop\nlyrics was by southern rapper Krazy, from Tampa, Florida. One of his songs was\ntitled \"I Hate My Baby Mama.\" The Outkast song \"Ms. Jackson\", released in\n2000, was dedicated to \"all the baby mamas' mamas\". American Idol winner\nFantasia Barrino released a song entitled \"Baby Mama\" in 2004. In this song\nshe is writing an ode to black single mothers and how to be a baby mama should\nbe a \"badge of honor\". She makes firsthand acknowledgements as a single mother\nand empathizes on the thoughts of baby mamas and how they are \"fed up with\nmakin' beds up.\" Planet Earth, an album by Prince released in 2007, features a\nsong called \"Future Baby Mama\". Three 6 Mafia had a song called \"Baby Mama\" on\n. Tupac's \"Dear Mama\", and \"Brenda's got a Baby\" are two hip hop songs that\nshow a strong Black woman/ mothering trope. Through these albums and songs,\nthere has come to be an acceptance to the term \"Baby Mama\" and also a creation\nto an alternative baby daddy.\n\n### In television\n\nAll My Babies' Mamas was an unaired reality show starring rapper Shawty Lo,\nshowcasing his lifestyle as the father of 11 children, mothered by 10\ndifferent women.\n\n### In film\n\nIn 2008, Universal Pictures released a comedy entitled Baby Mama starring Tina\nFey and Amy Poehler, in which Poehler plays a woman Fey hires to be her\nsurrogate. In many films, including some like Tyler Perry's \"Meet the Browns\",\nthat was released in 2008, there are many stereotypical representations of\nblack baby mamas. Brenda, who is played by Angela Bassett, is one of the main\ncharacters in the film that is portrayed as a stereotypical Black single\nmother who is caught in an endless cycle of poverty and struggle. She has\nthree children from three different men, none of which have a presence in\ntheir child's life. Throughout the film there is not indication that Brenda is\non welfare but nevertheless, she is a clear representation of a contemporary\n\"baby mama\". In stereo-typically fashion her character is someone who is\npowerless.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Ventura Highway\n\n\"Ventura Highway\" is a 1972 song by the band America from their album\nHomecoming.\n\n## Background\n\nDewey Bunnell, the song's vocalist and writer, has said that the lyric\n\"alligator lizards in the air\" in the song is a reference to the shapes of\nclouds in the sky he saw in 1963 while his family was driving down the coast\nfrom Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California, where they had a flat\ntire. While his father changed the tire, his brother and he stood by the side\nof the road and watched the clouds and saw a road sign for \"Ventura\". In the\nbooklet for the boxed set, Highway, he states that the song \"reminds me of the\ntime I lived in Omaha as a kid and how we'd walk through cornfields and chew\non pieces of grass. There were cold winters, and I had images of going to\nCalifornia. So I think in the song I'm talking to myself, frankly: 'How long\nyou gonna stay here, Joe?' I really believe that 'Ventura Highway' has the\nmost lasting power of all my songs. It's not just the words \u2014 the song and the\ntrack have a certain fresh, vibrant, optimistic quality that I can still\nrespond to\". The song has a \"Go West, young man\" motif in the structure of a\nconversation between an old man named Joe and a young and hopeful kid. Joe was\nmodeled after a \"grumpy\" old man he had met while his dad was stationed in\nBiloxi, Mississippi at Keesler Air Force Base. He also stated \"I remember\nvividly having this mental picture of the stretch of the coastline traveling\nwith my family when I was younger. Ventura Highway itself, there is no such\nbeast, what I was really trying to depict was the Pacific Coast Highway,\nHighway 1, which goes up to the town of Ventura.\" \"That's Gerry and Dan doing\na harmony on two guitars on the intro. I remember us sitting in a hotel room,\nand I was playing the chords, and Gerry got that guitar line, and he and Dan\nworked out that harmony part. That's really the hook of the song\".\n\n## Reception\n\nThe song went to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 for America, spending 12\nweeks on the charts after debuting on October 21, 1972. It also reached number\n43 in the UK Singles Chart, staying in that chart for 4 weeks.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe song contains the phrase \"purple rain\", later the title of a 1984 song,\nalbum, and film (and the tour that supported both the album and film), from\nthe artist Prince. Although whether actually any connection exists, both Mikel\nToombs of The San Diego Union and Bob Kostanczuk of the Post-Tribune have\nwritten that Prince got the title directly from \"Ventura Highway\". Asked to\nexplain the phrase \"purple rain\" in \"Ventura Highway,\" Gerry Beckley\nresponded: \"You got me.\" The song won many fans, including the pro wrestler-\nturned-politician, Jesse Ventura. Bunnell recalled, \"We went and played at\nGovernor Jesse Ventura's inaugural out in Minneapolis. He asked us to \u2014 his\nwife is a horse lady, and she'd always loved 'A Horse with No Name', and he\nhad adopted this name Ventura. So when he put together his cast of characters\nfor his big inaugural celebration, he wanted us to come and play two songs,\nwhich we did\".\n\n## Chart performance\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## Sampling and cover versions\n\n  * The song's opening guitar riff and musical hook is sampled throughout Janet Jackson's 2001 song \"Someone to Call My Lover\" by the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis who were influenced by America and \"Ventura Highway\" listening to KDWB 63 AM (Top 40) growing up in Minneapolis, Minnesota (along with their close friend, musician Prince). Bunnell said the use of the sample from \"Ventura Highway\" and the production by Jam, Lewis and Jackson boosted sales for America.\n\n  * In 2004, the song was recorded by Paul Hardcastle for the compilation album Jazzmasters (The Smooth Cuts) featuring Helen Rogers on vocals.\n\n  * In 2012, the song was recorded by the private party band The Gypsy Queens for their album The Gypsy Queens, featuring Booker T. Jones, as well as Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (author of the song) of the original America line-up. The album was produced by multiple Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. It was recorded at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles (Jim Henson Company). The album reached number 46 in the UK charts.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin\n\nFull House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin is a 1996 book by\nevolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. It was released in the United\nKingdom as Life's Grandeur, with the same subtitle and with an additional\neight-page introduction entitled \"A Baseball Primer for British Readers\".\n\n## Summary\n\nFull House aims to explain to the general reader how misconceptions about\nstatistics can lead people to misunderstand the role variation plays in\ndriving trends in complex systems. One misconception people often have is\nfocusing too narrowly on averages or extreme values rather than the full\nspectrum of variation in the entire system (what Gould calls the \"full house\"\nof variation). The book focuses on two main examples of this misconception:\nthe disappearance of the 0.400 batting average in baseball, and the perceived\ntendency of evolution towards \"progress\" making organisms more complex and\nsophisticated. In the first example, Gould explains that the decline of the\ntop batting average does not imply that there has been a decline in the skill\nof baseball players. Quite the contrary: he shows that all that has happened\nis that the variance of the batting average decreased as professional baseball\ngot better and better, while the league average remained constant as the game\nrules changed\u2014together causing the extreme value of the distribution\u2014the best\nbatting average\u2014to decrease as well. In the second example, Gould points out\nthat many people wrongly believe that the process of evolution has a preferred\ndirection\u2014a tendency to make organisms more complex and more sophisticated as\ntime goes by. Those who believe in evolution's drive towards progress often\ndemonstrate it with a series of organisms that appeared in different eons,\nwith increasing complexity, e.g., \"bacteria, fern, dinosaurs, dog, man\". Gould\nexplains how these increasingly complex organisms are just one end of the\ncomplexity distribution, and why looking only at them misses the entire\npicture\u2014the \"full house\". He explains that by any measure, the most common\norganisms have always been, and still are, the bacteria. The complexity\ndistribution is bounded at one side (a living organism cannot be much simpler\nthan bacteria), so an unbiased random walk by evolution, sometimes going in\nthe complexity direction and sometimes going towards simplicity (without\nhaving an intrinsic preference to either), will create a distribution with a\nsmall, but longer and longer tail at the high complexity end.\n\n## Reviews\n\n  * Human Chauvinism and Evolutionary Progress - by Richard Dawkins, Reprinted in The Devil's Chaplain Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2003 ().\n  * Evolution Up Against a Wall - by Michael Shermer, Los Angeles Times\n  * Bicycles, Baseball, Bacteria & Bach - by Michael Shermer, Los Angeles Times\n  * Where Have You Gone, Ted Williams? - by David Papineau, New York Times\n  * Gould's 'Full House' Tries To Put Humans In Their Place - by Mark Jaffe, Chicago Tribune\n  * Stephen Jay Gould Takes A New Swing At Explaining Evolution - by Jeremy Manier, Chicago Tribune\n  * Full House review - by Thomas Dietz, Contemporary Human Ecology\n  * Where is the Progress? - by Luis Rocha, Cybernetics and Human Knowing\n  * Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s Critique of Progress - by Richard York and Brett Clark, Monthly Review\n  * Full House review - by John Allen Paulos, Washington Post\n  * Full House review: - from Publishers Weekly\n\n## See also\n\n  * Evolution of complexity\n\n## External links\n\n  * Presentation by Gould on Full House, September 5, 1996\n\n",
      "# Vito & the Salutations\n\nVito & the Salutations is an Italian/Irish/Jewish-American New York City doo-\nwop group from the 1960s. They began performing their four-part harmonies\nwhile still in high school, getting practice by singing in subways and at\nrailroad stations. But they never expected anything to come of it, until one\nof the band members was introduced to someone at a local record company, and\nthe band was asked to make some recordings. Their first popular record,\n\"Gloria,\" was a regional hit. But Vito & the Salutations became best known for\na surprise million-selling hit a year later, in the summer of 1963: they took\n\"Unchained Melody,\" a 1955 hit ballad by Al Hibbler that they heard on the car\nradio, as they drove to perform at a concert, and transformed it into an up-\ntempo, doo-wop song. \"Unchained Melody\" reached number 66 on the Cash Box hit\nparade, and it made the top ten in many cities: for example, in New York City,\nthe song reached #3 on top-40 powerhouse WABC. The record was originally\nreleased on Herald (H-583). This group consisted of Frankie Fox (bass\nbaritone), Sheldon Buchansky (second tenor), Raymond JP Russell (first tenor)\nand Vito Balsamo (lead, baritone, and falsetto). Balsamo came from an\nimmigrant family: his parents were from Palermo, Italy and he grew up in\nBrooklyn, listening to opera. But he fell in love with rock and roll, much to\nthe dismay of his parents. Vito joined a group and recorded his first song\nwhen he was only fifteen. The B side of \"Unchained Melody\" was \"Hey, Hey,\nBaby,\" a tune composed by Murray Kanner, Frankie Fox and Dave Rick. Vito & the\nSalutations also performed their version of \"Unchained Melody\" on American\nBandstand. The group existed from 1961\u20131967, with a reunion concert performed\nat Hunter College in 1971, only Frankie and Sheldon Buchansky were the\noriginal members of this group in this performance. Featured lead singer was\nVito Balsamo, who also performed with the DelVons and The Kelloggs. In the\nearly 1990s, Balsamo participated in a doo-wop nostalgia tour, performing as\nVito Balsamo and the Cavaliers: this band included some former members of J.\nFrank Wilson and the Cavaliers (whose big hit was \"Last Kiss\" in 1964). Vito\nstill performs on occasional nostalgia tours, such as in The Golden Group\nMemories, which was seen on PBS in 1999 and 2000. Other lead singers were bass\nbaritone Frankie Fox and falsettos Ray Russell and Randy Siver, who joined the\ngroup after Ray Russell moved on to become a producer, writer and director\nwith James Duffy of Britton records; later, Frank Hidalgo and Eddie Parducci\nshared the lead with Vito in the group or on leave from the group. Over the\nyears there have been many substitutes and replacements: Jack Mercury, Alan\nMessinger, Madie Seigal, Vinny Cognato, Johnny Monforte and Randy Silverman\nalong with Frank and Vito recorded a single in 1967, \"Bring Back Yesterday\"\nb/w \"I Want You to Be My Baby\", on Boom Records. In the early 70's Sheldon\nBuchansky returned to form a new Salutations with Vito Eddie Parducci, Jimmy\nSpinelli, Frankie Graziano and others. Meanwhile, Vito Balsamo lost the right\nto use the name \"Vito & the Salutations\" in a court case in 1984, as a new\nband that included several former members took over the name.

      "# Okra\n\nOkra (, ), Abelmoschus esculentus, known in many English-speaking countries as\nladies' fingers or ochro, is a flowering plant in the mallow family. It is\nvalued for its edible green seed pods. The geographical origin of okra is\ndisputed, with supporters of West African, Ethiopian, and South Asian origins.\nThe plant is cultivated in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions\naround the world.\n\n## Etymology and common name\n\nFirst used around 1670, the name okra is from a West African language,\npossibly Igbo . Gombo (from American-French) has origin around 1805, becoming\nthe name gumbo used in parts of the Southeastern United States and the\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean (via Portuguese and Spanish quingombo). In India,\nit is known by the names vendakkai (alternatively bendakkai) or bhindi.\n\n## Origin and distribution\n\nOkra is an allopolyploid of uncertain parentage (proposed parents include\nAbelmoschus ficulneus, A. tuberculatus and a reported \"diploid\" form of okra).\nTruly wild (as opposed to naturalised) populations are not known with\ncertainty and the species may be a cultigen. The geographical origin of okra\nis disputed, with supporters of South Asian, Ethiopian and West African\norigins. The Egyptians and Moors of the 12th and 13th centuries used the\nArabic word for the plant, bamya, suggesting it had come into Egypt from\nArabia, but earlier it was probably taken from Ethiopia to Arabia. The plant\nmay have entered southwest Asia across the Red Sea or the Bab-el-Mandeb\nstraight to the Arabian Peninsula, rather than north across the Sahara, or\nfrom India. One of the earliest accounts is by a Spanish Moor who visited\nEgypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate\nthe tender, young pods with meal. From Arabia, the plant spread around the\nshores of the Mediterranean Sea and eastward. The plant was introduced to the\nAmericas by ships plying the Atlantic slave trade by 1658, when its presence\nwas recorded in Brazil. It was further documented in Suriname in 1686. Okra\nmay have been introduced to southeastern North America from Africa in the\nearly 18th century. By 1748, it was being grown as far north as Philadelphia.\nThomas Jefferson noted it was well established in Virginia by 1781. It was\ncommonplace throughout the Southern United States by 1800, and the first\nmention of different cultivars was in 1806.\n\n## Botany and cultivation\n\nThe species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate\nclimates, and often grows to around tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is\nrelated to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are long\nand broad, palmately lobed with 5\u20137 lobes. The flowers are in diameter, with\nfive white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of\neach petal. The pollens are spherical with approximately 188 microns diameter.\nIt is best germinated with a soil temperature of at least 20c The fruit is a\ncapsule up to long with pentagonal cross-section, containing numerous seeds.\nAbelmoschus esculentus is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm\ntemperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing\nround, white seeds. It is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable\nspecies in the world and will tolerate soils with heavy clay and intermittent\nmoisture, but frost can damage the pods. In cultivation, the seeds are soaked\novernight prior to planting to a depth of . Germination occurs between six\ndays (soaked seeds) and three weeks. Seedlings require ample water. The seed\npods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a vegetable, must\nbe harvested when immature, usually within a week after pollination. Okra is\navailable in two varieties, green and red. Red okra carries the same flavor as\nthe more popular green okra and differs only in color. When cooked, the red\nokra pods turn green. The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is\nverticillium wilt, often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other\ndiseases include powdery mildew in dry tropical regions, leaf spots, and root-\nknot nematodes.\n\n## Food and uses\n\nThe products of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic\n\"goo\" or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble\nfiber. Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. In India\nthe pods stuffed with spices are a popular dish. Okra may be used in\ndeveloping countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity.\n\n### Nutrition\n\nRaw okra is 90% water, 2% protein, 7% carbohydrates and negligible in fat. In\na 100 gram amount, raw okra is rich (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) in\ndietary fiber, vitamin C and vitamin K, with moderate contents of thiamin,\nfolate and magnesium (table).\n\n### Leaves and seeds\n\nYoung okra leaves may be cooked in a similar way to the greens of beets or\ndandelions. The leaves are also eaten raw in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted\nand ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for coffee. When importation of\ncoffee was disrupted by the American Civil War in 1861, the Austin State\nGazette said, \"An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a\nplantation with coffee in every way equal to that imported from Rio.\"\nGreenish-yellow edible okra oil is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant\ntaste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as oleic acid and\nlinoleic acid. The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At\n794 kg/ha, the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial.\nA 1920 study found that a sample contained 15% oil. A 2009 study found okra\noil suitable for use as a biofuel.\n\n### Industrial uses\n\nBast fibre from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the\nreinforcement of polymer composites. The mucilage produced by the okra plant\ncan be used for the removal of turbidity from wastewater by virtue of its\nflocculent properties. Having composition similar to a thick polysaccharide\nfilm, okra mucilage is under development as a biodegradable food packaging, as\nof 2018.\n\n## Gallery\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Rhapis excelsa\n\nRhapis excelsa, also known as broadleaf lady palm or bamboo palm, is a species\nof fan palm (Arecaceae subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Trachycarpeae) in the\ngenus Rhapis, probably native to southern China and Taiwan. It is not known in\nthe wild; all known plants come from cultivated groups in China. They were\nfirst collected by the Japanese for Tokugawa shogunate palaces, then\npopularity spread to Europe, and later to America where its low light and\nhumidity requirements make it a common feature in malls and offices. The genus\nname is Greek - rhapis, meaning \"needle\"; and the species name is Latin for\n\"tall\", though R. excelsa is not the tallest in the genus.\n\n## Description\n\nRhapis excelsa grows up to 4 m in height and 30 mm in diameter in multi-\nstemmed clumps with glossy, palmate evergreen leaves divided into broad,\nribbed segments. Leaf segments are single or few in young plants and increase\nto a dozen or more in mature plants; segments are divided to the petiole.\nLeaf-ends are saw-toothed unlike most other palms, occurring on slender\npetioles ranging from 20 to 60 cm in length. New foliage emerges from a\nfibrous sheath which remains attached to the base. As the plants age, the\nsheaths fall, revealing the bamboo-like trunks. This usually dioecious palm\nspecies produces a small inflorescence at the top of the plant with spirally-\narranged, fleshy yellow flowers containing three petals fused at the base.\nRipe fruit are fleshy and white, though R. excelsa more readily propagates via\nunderground rhizome offshoots. In the UK this plant has gained the Royal\nHorticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit.\n\n## Gallery\n\n## References\n\n  * Moore, H. E., Jr. (1963).

      "# Gaylord Yost\n\nDr. Gaylord Yost (28 January 1888 \u2013 10 October 1958) was a violinist,\ncomposer, and teacher. He is best known today for his collections of method\nbooks for the violin.\n\n## Biography\n\nGaylord Purcell Yost was born on January 28, 1888 in Fayette, Ohio. He was the\nonly child of Charles E. Yost, the proprietor and a journalist of The Fayette\nReview (the only newspaper in the village at the time) and Ada Purcell,\ndaughter of Lott. A Purcell, a well-known figure in Fayette. He started\nplaying violin in elementary school, and by age 12, he began composing violin\nand piano duets. By age 15, he was the leading violin teacher in the area. In\n1903, he went to further his studies at the Toledo Conservatory. He remained\nthere through 1904, then in 1905 went to the Detroit Conservatory, where he\nremained until 1906. After leaving Detroit, he went to Berlin to study with\nrenowned Russian virtuoso . He moved to Indianapolis around 1907 and between\n1907 and 1911 he toured as a concert artist across the United States, Europe,\nand South America. He began teaching at the collegiate level in 1911, as head\nof the violin department of the Indiana Conservatory of Music. He started\nteaching at Indiana University as head of the violin department in 1915, and\nalso taught at the Indiana College of Music and Fine Arts around this time. In\n1919, he moved to Pittsburgh and shortly thereafter became head of the violin\ndepartment at Pittsburgh Musical Institute, a position he held for 25 years.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, he conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony and formed the Yost\nString Quartet. He served as the first violinist, with Roy Shoemaker, a former\nPittsburgh Symphony musician and string department chair at PMI, as second\nviolinist, Carl Rosenberg as violist, and James Younger as cellist. In 1909,\nhe married Ella Caroline Schroeder, another violinist from Detroit. Later, in\n1917, he remarried to Ruth Margaret Stuernagel, with whom he had two children:\nGaylord C Yost and Sandia Yost. In 1936, he earned the Doctorate of Music\ndegree from Waynesburg College as well as an honorary membership in the\nInstitut Litteraire et Artistique de France. In 1950, his father died. This\nprompted Yost to move back to Fayette in 1951 and take over his father's old\nnewspaper. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the mayor of Fayette. He died in\nFayette on October 10, 1958 at the age of 70.\n\n## Works\n\nYost authored numerous short compositions for violin and piano through his\ncareer. One of his pieces, \"Ecolouge\", won the Institut Litteraire et\nArtistique de France's first prize in 1939. The International Who's Who in\nMusic and Musical Gazetteer, published in 1918, has a short list of his\ncompositions, and also notes that they were performed by Albert Spalding,\nEfrem Zimbalist, Arthur Hartmann, Kathleen Parlow, Maud Powell, and Louis\nPersinger, among others. Yost may be more widely known for his Yost Violin\nSystem, a myriad of method books for the violin, which focus on building basic\ntechnique to solidify one's playing. Who's Who in America asserted he had made\n\"revolutionary discoveries\" with his publication of the Yost System. Some of\nhis books include:\n\n  * Studies in Pizzicato and Harmonics\n  * Exercises for Change of Position\n  * Scale and Arpeggio Studies\n  * Key to the Mastery of the Finger Board\n  * Key to the Mastery of Bowing\n  * Bow and Finger Magic\n  * Spivakovsky Way of Bowing\n  * Key to the Mastery of Double-Stopping\n  * Studies in Finger Action and Position Playing\n\nMany of his method books are considered indispensable in violin technique.\n\n## References\n\n## See also\n\n  * http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/tc/id/27540\n\n",

A sleeper hit, the film became the highest-grossing romantic\ncomedy of all time, and grossed $241.4 million in North America, despite never\nreaching number one at the box office during its release. It was the highest-\ngrossing film to accomplish this feat for 14 years until the animated film\nSing grossed $268 million in 2016. The film spawned a franchise, which\ninspired the short-lived 2003 TV series My Big Fat Greek Life and a film\nsequel titled My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, was released on March 25, 2016.\n\n## Plot\n\nFotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos is her family's black sheep. Her staunchly proud\nGreek immigrant parents, Gus and Maria, have raised their daughters to follow\ntheir cultural traditions of marriage and motherhood. Her older sister Athena\nmet her family's expectations by marrying young to another Greek and becoming,\nin Toula's words, \"a Greek baby-breeding machine\". Toula, however, is 30 years\nold, unmarried, and still lives with her parents. She works at Dancing\nZorba's, her family's restaurant in Chicago. She longs for an independent life\naway from the restaurant and her loving, but intrusive family. Frumpy and\ncynical, she fears her life will never change. One day at the restaurant,\nToula notices a handsome customer--Ian Miller--walk in at lunchtime. She tries\nto chat with Ian as she takes his food order, only to embarrass herself with\nher social awkwardness. Ian is polite but bewildered by her behavior, and\nToula thinks she's lost her chance to get to know him. In a small step towards\nindependence, Toula wants to take computer classes at a local community\ncollege. When Toula approaches her father Gus about the classes, he forbids\nit, thinking she wants to leave her family. He insists she's \"smart enough for\na girl\", and her goal should be to get married and have children. After some\ncrafty persuasion by his wife, Maria, Gus reluctantly permits Toula to attend\nclasses. As her classes progress, Toula gains self-confidence. She trades her\nthick glasses for contact lenses and her baggy, drab clothes for flattering,\ncolorful outfits. She updates her hairstyle and learns to apply makeup. With\nher new computer skills and polished image, Toula asks her Aunt Voula to\nconvince Gus that Toula should work at Voula's travel agency instead of the\nrestaurant. Toula thrives in her new job, and while she's working at her desk,\nshe sees Ian walking by the travel agency. He notices Toula through the\nwindow, not recognizing that she is the same woman who tried to talk to him at\nDancing Zorba's. Despite Toula's lingering shyness, they introduce themselves\nand begin dating. When Ian realizes Toula was the nervous woman at the\nrestaurant, Toula is sure Ian will lose interest. Instead, he loves her even\nmore for who she is, and they become a couple. Because Ian is not Greek, Toula\nkeeps the relationship secret from her family, but her parents find out when a\nfamily friend sees them kissing in a parking lot. As she feared, Gus is angry\nbecause Ian is not an ethnic Greek\u2014referring to Ian as a \"Xeno\"\u2014and both Gus\nand Maria tell Toula to end the relationship. Toula insists she loves Ian. Her\nparents try to dissuade her by bringing various Greek bachelors home to meet\nher, all to no avail. When Ian proposes to Toula, she happily accepts, but Gus\nis upset that Ian did not ask him for permission to date Toula, let alone\nmarry her. Hoping to win her parents over, Ian tries to adapt to the family's\nGreek customs and mannerisms. When Toula informs Ian that they cannot marry in\nthe Greek Orthodox Church unless he converts, she suggests that they elope\ninstead. Ian reminds Toula how important it is to her family to marry in the\nchurch. He converts and is baptized, selecting Toula's cousin Nikki as a\ngodparent. Ian's willingness to do this encourages Gus and Maria to gradually\naccept Ian into the family. As Toula feared, her numerous well-meaning female\nrelatives take over much of the wedding plans, while the men keep testing Ian.\nCousin Nikki selects tacky bridesmaids dresses without Toula's permission; her\nbrother Nick semi-jokingly threatens Ian that he'll kill him if he ever hurts\nToula. Other cousins trick Ian into saying inappropriate things in Greek. When\nToula invites Ian's quiet, reserved parents to meet her parents at their home,\nshe insists that it be a simple dinner with just the six of them. Toula and\nIan arrive to find all of Toula's extended family at the dinner, where they\ndance and drink for hours. Ian's parents are unaware of Greek culture and are\nshocked by the family's rambunctiousness. On the wedding day, Toula is nervous\nand surrounded by relatives, but the traditional Greek wedding goes perfectly.\nAt the reception, Gus gives a speech accepting Ian and his parents as family.\nHe then presents the newlyweds with a deed to a house. Both Ian and Toula are\ndeeply touched by Gus's generosity. Following the reception, Toula and Ian\nleave for a honeymoon in Greece, both appreciating the craziness of their\nGreek family. An epilogue shows the couple's life six years later. Toula got\npregnant \"a minute later\" after their honeymoon with their daughter Paris. As\nIan and Toula are walking Paris from their house to Greek school, Paris asks\nwhy she has to go to Greek school. Toula replies that she had to go to Greek\nschool as a child, so Paris will too. But she assures her that when the time\ncomes, she can marry whomever she wants. As they walk, it is revealed that\ntheir home is next door to Toula's parents.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Nia Vardalos as Fotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos\n  * John Corbett as Ian Miller\n  * Lainie Kazan as Maria Portokalos\n  * Michael Constantine as Costas \"Gus\" Portokalos\n  * Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula\n  * Louis Mandylor as Nikos \"Nick\" Portokalos\n  * Gia Carides as Cousin Nikki\n  * Gerry Mendicino as Uncle Taki\n  * Joey Fatone as Cousin Angelo\n  * Bess Meisler as Yiayia (Grandma)\n  * Stavroula Logothettis as Athena Portokalos\n  * Ian Gomez as Mike, Ian's best man; he was Vardalos's real-life husband at the time of filming\n  * Bruce Gray as Rodney Miller\n  * Fiona Reid as Harriet Miller\n  * Jayne Eastwood as Mrs. White\n  * Arielle Sugarman as Paris Miller\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding started as a one-woman play written by and starring\nVardalos, performed for six weeks at the Hudson Backstage Theatre in Los\nAngeles in the summer of 1997. Vardalos later jokingly stated that she only\nwrote the play \"to get a better agent.\" The play was based on Vardalos's own\nfamily in Winnipeg in Canada and on her experience marrying a non-Greek man\n(actor Ian Gomez). The play was popular, and was sold out for much of its run,\nin part due to Vardalos's marketing it across Greek Orthodox churches in the\narea. A number of Hollywood executives and celebrities saw it, including\nactress Rita Wilson, who is herself of Greek origin; Wilson convinced her\nhusband, actor Tom Hanks, to see it as well. Vardalos began meeting various\nexecutives about making a film version of the play and began writing a\nscreenplay as well. However, the meetings proved fruitless because the\nexecutives insisted on making changes that they felt would make the film more\nmarketable, which Vardalos objected to: these included changing the plot,\ngetting a known actress in the lead role (Marisa Tomei was one name\nmentioned), and changing the family's ethnicity to Hispanic. Two months after\nthe play's initial run ended, Hanks's production company, Playtone, contacted\nVardalos about producing a film based on her vision for it; they also agreed\nto remount the play in early 1998, this time at LA's Globe Theatre. Hanks\nlater said that casting Vardalos in the lead role \"brings a huge amount of\nintegrity to the piece, because it's Nia's version of her own life and her own\nexperience. I think that shows through on the screen and people recognize it.\"\nIn 2000, while in Toronto doing pre-production for the film, Vardalos and\nPlaytone producer Gary Goetzman overheard actor John Corbett (who was in town\nshooting the film Serendipity) at a bar, telling a friend of his about having\nread the script for My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and being upset that he couldn't\nmake the auditions. Vardalos and Goetzman approached Corbett and offered him\nthe part of Ian Miller on the spot, which he accepted.\n\n### Filming\n\nDespite being based on life in the Greek community of Winnipeg, the film was\nset in Chicago and shot in both Toronto and Chicago. Toronto's Ryerson\nUniversity and Greektown neighborhood feature prominently in the film. The\nhome used to depict Gus and Maria Portokalos's residence (as well as the home\nbought next door at the end of the film for Toula and Ian) is located on\nGlenwood Crescent just off O'Connor Drive in East York. The real home\nrepresenting the Portokalos' residence actually has most of the external\nornamentation that was shown in the film. Also, some minor parts of the movie\nwere shot at Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto.\n\n## Release\n\nAfter a February 2002 premiere, it was initially released in the United States\nvia a limited release on April 19, 2002 before receiving a wider release\nworldwide over the summer, including a wide release in the United States on\nAugust 2.\n\n### Box office performance\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding became a sleeper hit and grew steadily from its\nlimited release. Despite never hitting the number one spot and being an\nindependent film with a $5 million budget, it ultimately grossed over $368.7\nmillion worldwide, becoming one of the top romantic films of the 21st century.\nIt was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2002 in the United States and\nCanada, with USD$241,438,208, and the highest-grossing romantic comedy in\nhistory. Domestically, it also held the record for the highest-grossing film\nnever having been number one on the weekly North American box office charts\nuntil the 2016 release of the animated film Sing. However, adjusted for\ninflation, the gross of My Big Fat Greek Wedding was still higher, equivalent\nto $ million in 2016. The film is among the most profitable of all time, with\na 6150% return on a (inflation adjusted) cost of $6 million to produce.\n\n### Critical reception\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating 76% based on 129 reviews,\nwith an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though\nit sometimes feels like a television sitcom, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is good-\nhearted, lovable, and delightfully eccentric, with a sharp script and lead\nperformance from Nia Vardalos.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a rating based on\nreviews, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 29 critics,\nindicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n### Accolades\n\n    * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10:\n      * Nominated Romantic Comedy Film\n\n### 10th-anniversary edition\n\nIn 2012, a 10th anniversary edition of the film was released via DVD and Blu-\nray. The edition contains a digital copy of the film and features deleted\nscenes as well as a 30-minute retrospective with Vardalos and Corbett.\n\n## Lawsuit\n\nThe cast (with the exception of Vardalos, who had a separate deal), as well as\nHanks's production company, Playtone, later sued the studio for their part of\nthe profits, charging that Gold Circle Films was engaging in so-called\n\"Hollywood accounting\" practices.\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Television series\n\nThe film inspired the brief 2003 TV series My Big Fat Greek Life, with most of\nthe major characters played by the same actors, with the exception of Steven\nEckholdt replacing Corbett as the husband. Corbett had already signed on to\nthe TV series Lucky. He was scheduled to appear as the best friend of his\nreplacement's character, but the show was cancelled before he appeared. The\nshow received poor reviews from critics noting the random character entrances\nand serious plot \"adjustments\" that did not match the film. The seven episodes\nfrom the series are available on DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,\nwhose TV studio division produced the show.\n\n### Sequel\n\nIn a 2009 interview for her film My Life in Ruins, asked about a possible\nsequel for My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Vardalos stated that she had an idea for\na sequel and had started writing it, hinting that, like Ruins, the film would\nbe set in Greece. Asked about a sequel again in a November 2012 interview, she\nstated: On May 27, 2014, various news and media outlets reported that a sequel\nwas in the works. Nia Vardalos later confirmed this via Twitter, and she also\nhas written a script for the film. The first trailer for My Big Fat Greek\nWedding 2 was aired on NBC's The Today Show on November 11, 2015 and it was\nreleased on March 25, 2016, to mixed reviews from critics and modest box\noffice success.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Next to Me (Imagine Dragons song)\n\n\"Next to Me\" is a song recorded by American rock band Imagine Dragons. Written\nby all four members of the band and producer Alex da Kid, it was released\nthrough Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on February 21, 2018, as the\nfourth single from the band's third studio album Evolve, appearing as the\nfirst track on a re-issue of the album.\n\n## Background and release\n\nThe band first teased the song on February 14, 2018, with a tweet that\ncontains the cover artwork, which features two people in a canyon. They\ncaptioned the picture: \"2/21 the evolution begins.\" The single premiered on\nZane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show as the day's \"World Record\", and was released\nalongside the announcement of extended summer tour dates. \"Next to Me\" was\nreferred to as the band's first love song. Dan Reynolds, lead singer of the\nsong, admitted that it was an unexpected theme change in the interview with\nLowe, saying: \"Yeah I don't typically write love songs. I started writing when\nI was about 13 years old and it was a source of an escape from school from\ndepression from feeling lost and it was never a romance. So for me this is\nsome of the first times that I've really explored diving into my mind and\nmusicality and sonicality of romance.\" He regarded it as \"something everybody\ncan relate to\", which is the \"feeling like you are going to fail sometimes in\na relationship and the true value of a relationship is what happens then\".\n\n## Music video\n\nAn accompanying short film for the song was released on March 13, 2018. The\nvideo stars the lead singer, Dan Reynolds, and his wife, Aja Volkman. In the\nvideo, Aja leaves Dan due to his problems, leading to him attempting to sell\nhis wedding ring. The clerk (Played by Wayne Sermon) tells him that the ring\nis not worth much, and in his anger, Dan attempts to rob and later kills the\nclerk. The rest of the video features a series of flashbacks while Dan is on\ndeath row, and his eventual execution.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nRyan Reed of Rolling Stone opined that the band manages to \"blend the\nexperimental and accessible\" on the track, writing that it \"builds to an\narena-worthy chorus with massive, choral-style backing vocals and electronic\neffects\". Scott T. Sterling of CBS Radio deemed the song \"a big and powerful\nballad that highlights Reynolds soaring and impassioned vocals\". Mike Wass of\nIdolator stated that the song features a \"sleepy tempo\".\n\n## Credits and personnel\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.

      "# The Surplus\n\n\"The Surplus\" is the tenth episode of the fifth season of the television\nseries The Office, and the show's eighty-second episode overall. The episode\naired in the United States on December 4, 2008 on NBC. In this episode, the\noffice is at odds over whether to spend a budget surplus on new chairs or a\nnew photocopier, with Jim, Pam, and Oscar in particular trying to convince\nMichael how to spend the money. Meanwhile, Andy and Angela visit Schrute Farms\nto discuss their wedding plans.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nOscar (Oscar Nunez) informs Michael (Steve Carell) that the office must spend\na $4300 surplus or lose it in next year's budget. When Michael opens up the\nfloor for suggestions, factions break out and officemates square off against\none another in order to get what they want. Oscar suggests that they replace\nthe copier while Pam (Jenna Fischer) suggests they buy new chairs and Toby\n(Paul Lieberstein) suggests that they get the air quality in the office tested\nsaying that there is radon coming from downstairs and asbestos coming from the\nceiling. Jim (John Krasinski) takes Oscar's side, much to Pam's shock, because\nhe started making copies himself since he and Pam started dating (asking Pam\nto make copies makes him feel awkward) and knows how bad the copier is, while\nthe rest of the employees side with Pam. Pam notices the copier malfunctioning\nwhen she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs. Michael does not\nchoose a side, because he does not want to be the bad guy, so both sides start\nwarming up to him to win him over. Jim and Oscar take Michael out for lunch,\nwhile Pam puts on more make-up and starts to hit on Michael. Meanwhile, Angela\n(Angela Kinsey) and Andy (Ed Helms) visit Schrute Farms to discuss wedding\nplans with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with\nDwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela's father. An Amish minister who\nonly speaks German plays the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight\ngoes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on\nAngela's finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears\nto be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting\ntogether with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the\nmock wedding was an actual wedding since Andy technically acted as their\nwitness and the supposedly fake minister was actually marrying them in German.\nHe tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on\nhis farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately\nkisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to\ntake care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).\nMichael still remains indecisive regarding what to buy, so he brings in a\nthird party: Hank (Hugh Dane) the security guard. However, Hank is more\ninterested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael\ncalls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that\nhe has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting\npaid a bonus equal to 15% of it. Michael then tells the employees that he is\nnot going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar realizes that\nMichael now knows about the 3rd option (Michael immediately says \"645 dollars\"\nwhen Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is but struggles to calculate 15% of\n200). Michael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees'\nintrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that\nthey will be unable to come to a consensus by the day's end and enable him to\ntake the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced\ninstead of remaining deadlocked, which upsets Michael. Later Michael is shown\nwearing a fur coat he had bought in anticipation of receiving the bonus, which\nhad fake blood thrown on it by activists. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try\nto get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, telling him that he\nis on \"dangerous ground\". Pam is nasty towards Jim during the entire debate,\nwhich Jim seems more easygoing about. However, at the end of the episode, Jim\ngets back at Pam for winning the debate by reverting to his earlier practice\nof having Pam make copies for him.\n\n## Reception\n\n\"The Surplus\" was voted the eighth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the\nfifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the\nepisode was rated 8.42 out of 10.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * This episode begins Ryan Howard's 11-episode absence from the office, as he went on vacation. He would return in \"Dream Team\".\n  * According to the commentary on this episode, B. J. Novak says that he was going to co-star in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds which is why his character is going to Thailand.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Surplus\" at NBC.com\n\n"

      "# List of songs featured in Shrek\n\nThe Shrek soundtracks are a collection of soundtracks from all four movies of\nthe Shrek series, including separate editions for the movie score. Each\nsoundtrack contains all songs that featured in their respective film, and the\nscore soundtrack contains the music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and\nJohn Powell.\n\n## Shrek (2001)\n\n### Background\n\nShrek was unique in that it used pop music and other oldies to move the story\nforward. Covers of songs like \"On the Road Again\" and \"Try a Little\nTenderness\" were integrated in the film's score. As the film was about to be\ncompleted, Katzenberg suggested the filmmakers redo the film's ending in order\nto \"go out with a big laugh\"; instead of ending the film with a storybook\nclosing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to\nadd the song \"I'm a Believer\" by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale\ncreatures in the film. Although Rufus Wainwright's version of the song\n\"Hallelujah\" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale's version that\nappeared in the film.

      "# Whatever and Ever Amen\n\nWhatever and Ever Amen is the second album by Ben Folds Five, released in\n1997. A remaster was made available on March 22, 2005. All of the extra tracks\nhad been previously released (as b-sides, soundtrack contributions, etc.)\nexcept for a cover of the Buggles song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which is\na staple of Ben Folds Five's live show.\n\n## Title, recording and cover\n\n### Title\n\nWhile recording the album, Folds told the Sheffield Electronic Press in\nNovember 1996 that the album would likely either be titled Cigarette or The\nLittle Girl With Teeth. The title Whatever and Ever Amen comes from a line in\nthe song \"Battle of Who Could Care Less.\"\n\n### Cover\n\nThe album's original cover featured individual photos of Folds, Sledge, and\nJessee, along with a hand-drawn Ben Folds Five logo, and a hand-drawn\n\"Whatever and Ever Amen.\" The cover of the 2005 remastered version moved the\nalbum\u2019s title from the top left corner to the center and added a fourth photo\nof all three bandmates sitting together.\n\n### Recording\n\nThe album was recorded in the front room of a house in Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina. Folds said, \"You can't go for perfection in a house. The spiritual\ncomet of the song comes by every so often and lots of technical things are\ngoing to be going wrong when that happens. Our producer, Caleb is very good at\nknowing when the ghost blew through the house. People don't buy records for\nthe accuracy.\" The first release for their new label, Epic, Folds said the\nrecord company did not get to hear the recording until it was finished,\nsaying, \"they knew what they were getting into\".\n\n## Track notes\n\nNear the end of the Nerdist podcast #132, Folds mentioned that the lyrics for\n\"Cigarette\" were taken from a newspaper article about a man who sought a\ndivorce from his wife after finding out she had a brain tumour, on the basis\nthat she was not the same person he had married. The \"sequel\" track, \"Fred\nJones Part Two\", is on Folds' first solo album, Rockin' the Suburbs. The track\n\"Steven's Last Night in Town\" was written about Ben Folds' friend Stephen\nShort, a Grammy-Award-winning record producer and manager. An early mix of\n\"Song for the Dumped\" appeared on the soundtrack album for the movie \"Mr.\nWrong\", but the song did not actually appear in the movie. The soundtrack was\nreleased on February 6, 1996, a full year before the release of \"Whatever and\nEver Amen\".\n\n### Hidden tracks\n\nThe first pressing of Whatever and Ever Amen features a clip of an actual\nargument in the studio between Folds, Sledge and Jessee, inserted between\n\"Brick\" and \"Song For the Dumped\". Speaking to The Shrubbery in 1999, Folds\nsaid that the clip \"was a painfully documented real argument that kept\nbringing up bad feelings. We decided to get rid of it and let the first\npressings be collectors ... Better to keep the band together. It was ugly.\"\nThe first pressing featured another hidden track, on the album's last track,\n\"Evaporated\", and in the negative space of track 1 on the Digitally Remastered\nversion. The clip is at a live concert, where band roadie Leo Overtoom yells\nout, \"I've got your hidden track right here: Ben Folds is a fuckin' asshole!\"\nA short video clip of this is featured in the video \"A Video Portrait\"\nreleased alongside the album.\n\n## Legacy\n\nNick Hornby writes one of his essays in the book 31 Songs about \"Smoke\".\n\n## Track listing\n\n## Personnel\n\n### The band\n\n  * Ben Folds - Piano, lead vocals, electric piano, melodica\n  * Darren Jessee - Drums, percussion, backing vocals\n  * Robert Sledge - Bass guitar, double bass, backing vocals\n\n### Additional musicians\n\n  * John Catchings - Cello on 5 and 12\n  * Alicia Svigals - Violin on 9\n  * Matt Darriau - Clarinet on 9\n  * Frank London - Trumpet on 9\n  * Caleb Southern - Hammond organ on 3\n  * Norwood Cheek - Synthesizer space sound on 1\n\n### Production\n\n  * Caleb Southern - Producer, Engineer\n  * Ben Folds - Producer, Engineer\n  * Andy Wallace - Mixing\n  * Steve Sisco - Mixing Assistant\n  * Howie Weinberg - Mastering\n  * John Mark Painter - String arrangements\n  * Leigh Smiler - Cover Design\n  * Chris Stamey - Pro-Tools\n  * The Klezmatics - Special Contributor\n\n## Certifications\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Tree Gelbman\n\nTheresa \"Tree\" Gelbman is a fictional character from Christopher Landon's\nslasher film Happy Death Day (2017) and its sequel Happy Death Day 2U (2019).\nShe was created by writer Scott Lobdell and portrayed by Jessica Rothe in both\nof her performances. Gelbman's storyline revolves around her being murdered on\nthe night of her birthday and finding herself reliving the day repeatedly. She\nuses this as an opportunity to figure out her killer's identity and prevent\nher death from ever occurring. Rothe additionally reprised her role as Tree in\nWhitney Avalon's \"This Song is Killer (ft. Jessica Rothe)\", in promotion of\nthe then-upcoming Happy Death Day 2U. Style Island described the character as\n\"the coolest girl in horror\" and proceeded to say \"Rothe plays the role with\nrefreshing wit and the perfect amount of edginess mixed with empathy.\"\n\n## Biography\n\nTheresa \"Tree\" Gelbman was born on September 18, and is the daughter of David\nand Julie Gelbman. She attends Bayfield University and is a part of the Kappa\nPi Lambda sorority. On her birthday in 2017, Gelbman was murdered by somebody\nwearing the university's mascot mask. She relives the same day 12 times until\nshe figures out the identity of her killer, revealed to be her roommate, Lori\nSpengler. Tree manages to stop Lori by stuffing a poisoned cupcake (which is\nwhat Lori originally intended to kill Tree with) in her mouth and kicking her\nout a window. In the sequel, Tree re-enters the loop in a new dimension and\nlearns there is a new killer. In this second loop, Tree learns that Lori is\nnot trying to kill her, Tree's mother Julie is still alive, Carter is\nromantically involved with her friend Danielle and Tree is not having an\naffair with her teacher Dr. Gregory Butler. The second killer is revealed to\nbe Dr. Butler, in league with his wife, Stephanie. Tree learns they were after\nLori instead of her. After Dr. Butler betrays and kills Stephanie, Tree kills\nhim with a screwdriver to the heart and saves Lori.\n\n## Reception\n\nJohn Squires of Bloody Disgusting described Gelbman as a modern example of the\n\"final girl\" trope and contrasts her to Friday the 13th's Alice Hardy, writing\n\"The Happy Death Day movies present a heroine so wonderfully and completely\nrealized that this may very well be the first ever slasher franchise with a\n'final girl' character as the main selling point. A character who evolves. A\ncharacter who, with each new film thus far, becomes a better person right\nbefore our eyes.\" Padraic Maroney of EDGE Media Network praised Rothe's\nportrayal of the heroine, stating \"More than anything, what makes these films\nwork is lead actress Jessica Rothe. ... Rothe offers a new take on the final\ngirl.\" Nick Perkins, on ComingSoon.net, lists Tree as fifth on his list of\nslasher film final girls, writing that \"Tree Gelbman starts off the first\nHappy Death Day movie as kind of a terrible person. She's selfish, apathetic\nand blissfully unaware. By the end of the movie, she's a rock star.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Dirty Harry (song)\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" is a song from British alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz'\nsecond studio album Demon Days.\n\n## Song history\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" was first released as a promotional single on iTunes before\nbeing released as the third single from the album on 21 November 2005, peaking\nat #6 in the UK. An early version entitled \"I Need a Gun\" was included on\nDamon Albarn's album Democrazy. On 8 December 2005, \"Dirty Harry\" was\nnominated for a Grammy under the category \"Urban/Alternative Performance\", but\nwas beaten by Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley's \"Welcome to Jamrock\".\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video was first released on 25 October 2005, sent to those on the e-mail\nlist on Gorillaz' official website. A thematic follow-up to the band's \"Clint\nEastwood\", it refers to the film of the same name, Clint Eastwood being the\nlead actor in the movie. \"Dirty Harry\" is one of the few Gorillaz music videos\nshot on location, the others being \"Stylo\", \"DoYaThing\", \"Strobelite\", and\n\"Humility\". Initially, the group intended to utilise a computer animated\ndesert as background, but discovered that simply flying to a real desert was\neasier and cheaper. The video was shot in the Swakopmund Desert in Namibia; it\nmainly features shirtless 2-D and an animated version of the San Fernando\nValley Youth Chorus stranded there, following what appears to have been a\nhelicopter crash. The survivors keep themselves entertained with the song\nwhile awaiting the arrival of rescuers, portrayed by Noodle and Murdoc crewing\na Windhoeker Maschinenfabrik Wer\u2019wolf MKII mine-proof vehicle driven by Russel\n(who wears a Fu Manchu). Both song and video feature a guest appearance by\nPharcyde rapper Bootie Brown, who leaps out of a sand dune in military\nfatigues to perform his verse of the song. The video concludes with Gorillaz,\nthe children and Bootie Brown departing the crash site in the Werwolf, which\nbreaks down a short distance away.\n\n## Track listing\n\nUK CD1 / Digital Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"All Alone\" (Live) \u2013 3:39\n\nUK CD2 / Digital E.P.\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n\nUK DVD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Murdoc Is God\" \u2013 2:26\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Animatic) \u2013 3:47\n\nEuropean / Australian CD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Animatic) \u2013 3:47\n\nJapanese CD Single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"All Alone\" (Live) \u2013 3:39\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n\nUS Digital EP\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" \u2013 3:47\n* \"Highway (Under Construction)\" \u2013 4:20\n* \"Hongkongaton\" \u2013 3:34\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Video) \u2013 4:56\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Live in Harlem - Video) \u2013 6:12\n\nUK 12\" vinyl\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Jon Carter remix) \u2013 5:58\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Chopper remix) \u2013 3:38\n\nAustralian promo CD single\n\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Paul Mac remix) (edit) \u2013 3:28\n* \"Dirty Harry\" (Paul Mac remix) (full-length) \u2013 5:11\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Damon Albarn: vocals, synthesizers, guitars, string arrangements\n  * Bootie Brown: rap\n  * Jason Cox: bass guitar, production\n  * Danger Mouse: sampled loops, percussion, drum programming, production\n  * The San Fernandez Youth Chorus: additional vocals\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Rolling Stone article\n  * MTV news article with confirmation\n\n",
      "# Love means never having to say you're sorry\n\n\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\" is a catchphrase based on a line\nfrom the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film\nadaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. The line is spoken twice in\nthe film: once in the middle of the film, by Jennifer Cavalleri (MacGraw's\ncharacter), when Oliver Barrett (O'Neal) apologizes to her for his anger; and\nas the last line of the film, by Oliver, when his father says \"I'm sorry\"\nafter learning of Jennifer's death. In the script the line is phrased slightly\ndifferently: \"Love means not ever having to say you're sorry.\" The line proved\nmemorable, and has been repeated in various contexts since. In 2005 it was\nvoted #13 in the American Film Institute's list AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie\nQuotes. The band Sounds of Sunshine had a Top 40 hit in the United States with\na song titled \"Love Means You Never Have to Say You're Sorry\" in 1971. \"Love\nmeans never having to say you're...\" is the opening sentence in the popular\nsong \"Can't Help but Love You\" by The Whispers, from their album named after\nthe movie, issued in 1972. The line has also been criticized or mocked, for\nsuggesting that apologies are unnecessary in a loving relationship. Another\ncharacter played by O'Neal disparages it in the 1972 screwball comedy What's\nUp, Doc?: in that film's final scene, Barbra Streisand's character says \"Love\nmeans never having to say you're sorry.\" while batting her eyelashes, and\nO'Neal's character responds in a deadpan voice, \"That's the dumbest thing I\never heard.\"\n\n## In popular culture\n\nIn the 34th episode of the second season of Small Wonder, entitled \"You Gotta\nHave Heart\", little robot girl Vicki's parents explain love to her as \"love\nmeans never having to say you're sorry.\" In a 2004 episode of The Simpsons\n(\"Catch 'Em If You Can\"), the Simpson family watches the film, and Lisa\nretorts, \"No it doesn't!\" The line has also been parodied countless times,\nusually substituting another word or phrase for \"love\" and/or \"you're sorry\",\nespecially the latter. The quote is also shown in TV series Love Rain. On\niZombie Season 2, Episode 19, titled \"Salivation Army\", Liv says, \"A massive\nzombie outbreak means never having to say you're sorry.\" On Weeds, Nancy\nBotwin, after the death of her drug dealer mentor, U-Turn, explains to the\ntattoo artist her reason for getting a U-Turn traffic sign tattoo is that \"It\njust reminds me that Thug means never having to say you're sorry.\" When asked\nby the tattoo artist if she doesn't mean \"love\", Nancy replies, \"Absolutely\nnot. Love means you're constantly apologizing.\" In the episode \"Stop, In the\nName of Love\" of Family Matters, Waldo Faldo asks Laura Winslow out, and she\naccepts, much to Steve Urkel's dismay. Waldo then responds to Urkel saying,\n\"I'm sorry, Steve. I know how you feel about Laura, but it's like they say in\nthe movie Love Story, 'Love means never having to say, I'm sorry' Steve, but\nI'm taking your chick!\" In Dark Shadows, Johnny Depp's character Barnabas\nCollins tells a group of hippies, \"I am reminded of a line from Erich Segal's\n'Love Story': 'Love means never having to say you are sorry.'\" \"However,\nplease know that it is with sincere regret... that I must now kill all of\nyou.\" On Why Women Kill, Season 1, Episode 1 is titled \"Murder Means Never\nHaving to Say You're Sorry\".\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Mary, Did You Know?\n\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" is a Christmas song addressing Mary, mother of Jesus,\nwith lyrics written by Mark Lowry in 1984, and music written by Buddy Greene\nin 1991. It was originally recorded by Christian recording artist Michael\nEnglish on his self-titled debut solo album in 1991. At the time, English and\nLowry were members of the Gaither Vocal Band, and Greene was touring with\nthem. The song reached Number 6 on CCM Magazine's Adult Contemporary Chart.\nLowry would record the song several times himself, most notably with the\nGaither Vocal Band on their 1998 Christmas album, Still the Greatest Story\nEver Told. The song has since gone on to become a modern Christmas classic,\nrecorded by hundreds of artists over the years, across multiple genres.\nDifferent versions have reached the top ten in the Billboard R&B; and Holiday\ncharts.\n\n## Music and lyrics\n\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" was originally released in the key of E minor, with a\ntempo of 53 beats per minute based around a chord progression of\nEm\u2013D\u2013Am7\u2013B7sus4\u2013B7 and is in the meter. The lyrics evolved from a series of\nquestions that Lowry scripted for a Christmas program at his church: None of\nthe questions are answered in the song. Instead, the lyrics poetically invite\nthe listener to contemplate the relationship between Mary and her newborn\ndivine son, even if her faith and awareness did not yet include the details of\nwhat would unfold. The text has received criticism for perceived ambiguity or\nlack of scriptural or theological depth. For example, Lutheran writer Holly\nScheer, in addressing the rhetorical question of the song's title, wrote:\n\"Anyone who has even a slight familiarity with the biblical account of\nChrist's conception and birth shouldn't need to ask if Mary knew, because the\nBible plainly tells us she did.\" Baptist theologian Michael Frost suggests it\nis the \"most sexist Christmas song ever written... It treats her like a\nclueless child... Could you imagine a song asking Abraham 17 times if he knew\nhe'd be the father of a great nation?\"\n\n## Kenny Rogers & Wynonna Judd version\n\nA duet version, recorded by Wynonna Judd and Kenny Rogers on Rogers' holiday\nalbum The Gift, peaked at No. 55 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks\nchart in 1997. Chart positions\n\n## Clay Aiken version\n\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" was Clay Aiken's fifth single from his 2004 Christmas\nalbum Merry Christmas with Love.

      "# List of songs featured in Shrek\n\nThe Shrek soundtracks are a collection of soundtracks from all four movies of\nthe Shrek series, including separate editions for the movie score. Each\nsoundtrack contains all songs that featured in their respective film, and the\nscore soundtrack contains the music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and\nJohn Powell.\n\n## Shrek (2001)\n\n### Background\n\nShrek was unique in that it used pop music and other oldies to move the story\nforward. Covers of songs like \"On the Road Again\" and \"Try a Little\nTenderness\" were integrated in the film's score. As the film was about to be\ncompleted, Katzenberg suggested the filmmakers redo the film's ending in order\nto \"go out with a big laugh\"; instead of ending the film with a storybook\nclosing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to\nadd the song \"I'm a Believer\" by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale\ncreatures in the film. Although Rufus Wainwright's version of the song\n\"Hallelujah\" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale's version that\nappeared in the film. Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks and John Cale\nwas not, thus licensing issues prohibited Cale's version from appearing in the\nsoundtrack album.\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nShrek: Music from the Original Motion Picture is the soundtrack of the 2001\nAcademy Award-winning and Golden Globe-nominated animated feature Shrek. The\nalbum was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music (lost to the score\nof Moulin Rouge!) and the Grammy Award for \"Best Compilation Soundtrack Album\nfor a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\" (lost to the score of\nO Brother, Where Art Thou?).

      "# Oriental Bank of Commerce\n\nOriental Bank of Commerce ( ) is an Indian public sector bank. Headquartered\nat Gurgaon, Haryana, has 2390 branches and 2625 ATMs across India.\n\n## History\n\nRai Bahadur Lala Sohan Lal the first Chairman of the Bank, founded OBC in 1943\nin Lahore. Within four years of its coming into existence, OBC had to face\nPartition. The bank had to close down its branches in the newly formed\nPakistan and shift its registered office from Lahore to Amritsar. Lala Karam\nChand Thapar, the then Chairman of the Bank, in a unique gesture honoured the\ncommitments made to the depositors from Pakistan and paid every rupee to its\ndeparting customers. The Bank has witnessed many ups and downs since its\nestablishment. The period of 1970-76 is said to be the most challenging phase\nin the history of the Bank. At one time profit plummeted to 175, that prompted\nthe owner of the bank, the Thapar Group, to sell / close the bank. Then\nemployees and leaders of the Bank came forward to rescue the Bank. The owners\nwere moved and had to change their decision of selling the bank and in turn\nthey decided to improve the position of the bank with the active cooperation\nand support of all the employees. Their efforts bore fruits and performance of\nthe bank improved significantly. This was the turning point in the history of\nthe bank. The bank was nationalised on 15 April 1980. At that time OBC ranked\n19th among the 20 nationalised banks. In 1997, OBC acquired Bari Doab Bank and\nPunjab Cooperative Bank. The acquisition of these two banks brought with it no\nadditional branches. The bank has progressed on several fronts, crossing the\nBusiness Mix mark of 2 lac crores as on 31 March 2010 making it the seventh\nlargest Public Sector Bank in India. On 14 August 2004, OBC amalgamated Global\nTrust Bank (GTB). GTB was a leading private sector bank in India that was\nassociated with various financial discrepancies leading to a moratorium being\nimposed by RBI shortly before it merged into OBC. The acquisition brought with\nit 103 branches, which increased OBC's branch total to 1092. As per March\n2018-2019 annual report, it has 2390 branches and 2625 ATMs pan India. On 30\nAugust 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the Oriental\nBank of Commerce and United Bank of India would be merged with Punjab National\nBank. The proposed merger would make Punjab National Bank the second largest\npublic sector bank in the country with assets of and 11,437 branches. MD and\nCEO of United Bank, Ashok Kumar Pradhan, stated that the merged entity would\nbegin functioning from 1 April 2020 and would operate under a new name.\n\n## Chairpersons\n\nThe Chairpersons (CMD) of the bank were as under:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe bank offers a wide range of banking products and services such as deposit\naccounts, loans, debit cards, credit cards (with tie up with SBI), Insurance\nproducts, ATMs, Internet banking, Mobile Banking, Self-banking halls, call\ncentre, etc. The Bank has launched yet another people's participation in the\nplanning process at grass root level essentially to tackle the maladies of\npoverty. The Grameen Projects venture aims to alleviate poverty plus identify\nthe reasons responsible for the failure or success. OBC is already\nimplementing a Grameen Project in Dehradun District (UK) and Hanumangarh\nDistrict (Rajasthan). Formulated on the pattern of the Bangladesh Grameen\nBank, the Scheme has a unique feature of disbursing small loans ranging from\n75 (~US $1.50) onwards. The beneficiaries of the Grameen Project are mostly\nwomen. The Bank is engaged in providing training to rural folk in using\nlocally available raw material to produce pickles, jams etc. This has provided\nself-employment and augmented income levels thus reforming lives of rural folk\nand encouraging cottage industries in rural areas. OBC launched yet another\nunique scheme christened 'The Comprehensive Village Development Programme' on\nthe auspicious day of Baisakhi, the 13th of April 1997 at three villages in\nPunjab namely Rurki Kalan (District. Sangrur), Raje Majra (District. Ropar)\nand Khaira Majha (District. Jaladhar) and two villages in Haryana, namely\nKhunga (District. Jind) and Narwal (District. Kaithal). The pilot launch was a\ngreat success. Emboldened by the success, Bank extended the programme to more\nvillages. At present, it covers 15 villages; 10 in Punjab, 4 in Haryana and 1\nin Rajasthan. The programme focuses on providing a comprehensive and\nintegrated package providing rural finance to the villagers with Village\nDevelopment as its focus, thus contributing towards infrastructural\ndevelopment and augmentation of income for each farmer of the village. The\nBank has implemented 14 point action plan for strengthening of credit delivery\nto women and has designated 5 branches as specialised branches for women\nentrepreneurs.\n\n## Notes, citations, and references\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n* Annual Report 2019 \n* Baker, Henry D.

      "# United Bank of India\n\nUnited Bank of India (UBI) is an Indian government-owned bank headquartered in\nKolkata, India. Presently the bank has a three-tier organisational setup\nconsisting of its head office in Kolkata, 36 regional offices and 2054\nbranches spread all over India. However, its major presence is in Eastern\nIndia. The bank has three full-fledged overseas branches, one each at Kolkata,\nNew Delhi and Mumbai. United Bank of India now aims to expand its\ninternational activities. On 30 March 2009, the Indian government approved the\nrestructuring of United Bank of India. The government proposed to invest 2.5\nbillion rupees in shares by 31 March and another 5.50 billion in the next\nfiscal year in Tier-I capital instruments. The move is part of the Indian\ngovernment's program to improve the capital base of the state-owned banks. UBI\ngets SEBI approval for Rs 1,000 crore equity issue via QIP On 22 November\n2017, United Bank of India (UBI) said it has received SEBI\u2019s approval for\nissue of equity shares worth Rs 1,000 crore by way of institutional placement.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Government of India announced the bank would be merged\ninto Punjab National Bank of India. The merger is most likely come into effect\nat the beginning of the next fiscal year starting on April 2020.\n\n## History\n\nUBI was the result of the merger in 1950 of four Bengali banks: Comilla\nBanking Corporation (founded by Narendra Chandra Dutta in 1914 in what is now\nBangladesh), Bengal Central Bank (founded by Sri J.C. Das in 1918), Comilla\nUnion Bank (founded by Shri Indu Bhusan Dutta (IAS), in 1922) and Hooghly Bank\n(founded by Sri D.N. Mukherjeee 1932). All four had suffered runs in December\n1983 after the failure of the Nath Bank. The Reserve Bank of India assisted\nthe banks in amalgamating to form United Bank of India. In 1961, UBI merged\nwith Cuttack Bank (est. 6 June 1913) and Tezpur Industrial Bank (est. 6 June\n1918, as the first commercial bank in Assam province). Four years later, in\n1965, the Government of Pakistan took over the bank's branches in Pakistan. On\n19 July 1969, the Government of India nationalised UBI, along with 13 other\nmajor Indian commercial banks. At the time of nationalisation UBI had only 174\nbranches. In 1973, UBI acquired Hindustan Mercantile Bank (est. 1944). In\n1976, UBI acquired Narang Bank of India, which had been established in 1943 in\nNarang, Gujarat. On 30 August 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\nannounced that United Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce would be merged with\nPunjab National Bank. The proposed merger would make Punjab National Bank the\nsecond largest public sector bank in the country with assets of and 11,437\nbranches. MD and CEO of UBI, Ashok Kumar Pradhan, stated that the merged\nentity would begin functioning from 1 April 2020 and would operate under a new\nname.\n\n## Awards/ certifications received by the Bank\n\n## Controversy over Non-performing Assets (NPAs)\n\nIn February 2014, an RBI-appointed forensic audit by Deloitte found serious\nlapses in the Non-performing asset detection system of the bank. It is yet to\nbe established whether this oversight on the part of the bank was deliberate\nor unintentional. The bank has reported a loss of Rs. 1,238 crore during Q3 of\nthe 2013-14 fiscal year, resulting in a downgrade of its tier-II bonds by\nICRA, an associate of Moody's Investor Service. United Bank of India's\nreported NPA of 10.82% is the highest in percentage among listed banks in\nIndia.\n\n## Delivery channel based products\n\n  * ATM with cash recycler at many branches\n  * Varieties of debit card like platinum and moments card\n  * Internet banking\n  * Mobile banking\n  * Prepaid card\n  * SMS banking\n  * United E passbook application\n  * United wallet for utilities payment\n  * United credit card\n  * United UPI Bhim application\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of banks in India\n  * United Bank of India (1866-1874)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Official website\n\n",

In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",
      "# Stronger Than Me\n\n\"Stronger Than Me\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse\nfrom her debut studio album Frank (2003). Written by Winehouse and Salaam\nRemi, \"Stronger Than Me\" was released in the United Kingdom as the lead single\non 6 October 2003, it ended up as the lowest-charting single from Frank and of\nWinehouse's career, peaking at number 71 on the UK Singles Chart. The song\nnevertheless won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song Musically\nand Lyrically in 2004. The single for \"Stronger Than Me\" features an exclusive\nB-side, \"What It Is\". A rare live version of the song performed by Winehouse\nwas featured in the documentary film biopic that's based on the life & death\nof Winehouse, Amy (2015) and the original version was included on the film's\noriginal soundtrack. It was said in the film that \"Stronger Than Me\" first\nsold over 800 copies a day after its initial release by Winehouse's previous\nguitarist, Ian Burter.\n\n## Music video\n\nA music video was produced to promote the single. The video features Winehouse\nentering a bar and finding her boyfriend drunk. Winehouse laments her\nboyfriend's failure to be the stronger and more dominant partner. The video\ncontinues as she returns her boyfriend to their apartment. Winehouse is seen\nbeing fondled by her drunken boyfriend as they struggle to exit the bar, and\nshe looks on in disgust as he vomits in their taxi. As the video concludes,\nshe's seen on a street struggling to get her unconscious boyfriend into their\nhome. Failing to do so, Winehouse gives up, leaving him semi-conscious on the\nsidewalk and going inside as the song ends.\n\n## Track listings and formats\n\nUK CD single and digital download\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" \u2013 3:33\n* \"What It Is\" \u2013 4:44\n* \"Take the Box\" (The Headquarters Mix) \u2013 3:49\n\nUK promo CD single\n\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:33\n\nUK 12\" single\n\n* Side A:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Album Version)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Curtis Lynch Jnr.)\n* Side B:\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Harmonic 33 Remix)\n* \"Stronger Than Me\" (Acapella)\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",

      "# List of U.S. states and territories by elevation\n\nThe elevation of the U.S. states, the federal district, and the territories\nmay be described in several ways. These include: The following list is a\ncomparison of elevation absolutes in the United States. Data include interval\nmeasures of highest and lowest elevation for all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and territories. Which state or territory is \"highest\" and \"lowest\"\nis determined by the definition of \"high\" and \"low\". For instance, Alaska\ncould be regarded as the highest state because Denali, at , is the highest\npoint in the United States. However, Colorado, with the highest mean elevation\nof any state as well as the highest low point, could also be considered a\ncandidate for \"highest state\". Determining which state is \"lowest\" is equally\nproblematic. California contains the Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at below\nsea level, the lowest point in the United States; while Florida has the lowest\nhigh point, and Delaware has the lowest mean elevation. Florida is also the\nflattest state, with the smallest difference between its highest and lowest\npoints. The list of highest points in each state is important to the sport of\nhighpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point in each of\nthe contiguous 48 states, or in all 50 states, or in all 50 states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia and the territories.

      "# 60th parallel north\n\nThe 60th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 60 degrees north of\nEarth's equator. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America,\nand the Atlantic Ocean. Although it lies approximately twice as far away from\nthe Equator as from the North Pole, the 60th parallel is half as long as the\nEquator line. This is where the Earth bulges halfway as much as on the\nEquator. At this latitude, the Sun is visible for 18 hours, 52 minutes during\nthe June solstice and 5 hours, 52 minutes during the December solstice. The\nmaximum altitude of the Sun is 53.44\u00b0 on 21 June and 6.56\u00b0 on 21 December. The\nmaximum altitude of the Sun is > 15.00\u00ba in October and > 8.00\u00ba in November.\nThe lowest latitude where white nights can be observed is approximately on\nthis parallel.\n\n## Around the world\n\nStarting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 60\u00b0 north\npasses through:\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, the 60th parallel constitutes the mainland boundary between the\nnorthern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut to the\nnorth, and the western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,\nand Manitoba to the south. Accordingly, \"north of 60\" is an expression often\nused for the territories, although parts of Nunavut (the islands in Hudson Bay\nand James Bay) are located south of the 60th parallel, and parts of Quebec and\nNewfoundland and Labrador are located north, to the east of Hudson Bay.

    "question": "Who coined the term shot heard around the world?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Shot heard round the world\n\n\"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase that refers to the opening shot\nof the Battle of Concord in 1775, which began the American Revolutionary War\nand led to the creation of the United States of America. The phrase has\nsubsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.\n\n## Skirmish at the North Bridge\n\nThe phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord\nHymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the\nOld North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers\nfell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically,\nno single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots\nwere fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans\nwere killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that\nevent are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the\nfirst shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by\nAmericans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat. The\ntowns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the\nRevolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns.\nHe was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \"birthplace of\nAmerican liberty\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \"first\nforcible resistance\" was made there. President Ulysses S. Grant considered not\nattending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In\n1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as\n\"Lexington Day\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday\nis Patriots' Day. Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time\nwhen he was composing the \"Concord Hymn\", from which his grandfather and\nfather (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located\napproximately from the North Bridge.\n\n## Assassination of Franz Ferdinand\n\nThe phrase \"shot heard round the world\" (alternatively \"shots heard round the\nworld\" or \"shot heard around the world\") has also become associated with the\nassassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June\n1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I.\nSerbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's\nwife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke\nhimself. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,\npropelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.\n\n## Widespread idiomatic use\n\nThe phrase \"Shot heard round the world\" continues to be a stock phrase in the\n21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general. The\nphrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history. In\nbaseball, the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" refers to the game-winning walk-\noff home run by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers\npitcher Ralph Branca to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951.\nThe Giants won the game 5\u20134 as a result of the home run, defeating their\ntraditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually\nlost the World Series to the Yankees. In association football, the shot heard\nround the world refers to Paul Caligiuri's winning goal for the United States\nmen's national soccer team in the final qualifying round for the 1990 FIFA\nWorld Cup on 19 November 1989. The US had not qualified for the World Cup\nsince 1950. The team was in third position of the CONCACAF playoffs before\ntheir final game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The US had to\nwin to go to the finals, their opponents only needed a draw. Defensive\nmidfielder Caliguri, the only full-professional player in the team, received\nthe ball 40 yards out from goal, and instead of passing it to a striker, beat\none defender and launched a 30-yard shot that looped into goal.\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Shot heard round the world (soccer)\n\nThe \"Shot heard round the world\" is a term used in reference to one of the\nmost historic goals in U.S. soccer history, which allowed the U.S. national\nteam to make it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup after 36 years of failed attempts\nto qualify. This goal was scored in the qualification game between United\nStates and Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989 in Port of Spain. The U.S.\nteam had not qualified for a FIFA World Cup since 1950, and the U.S. (having\nbeing selected by FIFA in 1988 to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup) wanted to give\na good impression to the world of soccer by qualifying to the 1990 World Cup.\n\n## Background\n\nThe United States was one of the five nations competing in the final round of\nCONCACAF's qualifiers for two spots at the upcoming World Cup in Italy, the\nother involved nations being Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Trinidad &\nTobago. Mexico was disqualified due to a scandal related with the age\nadulteration for a youth tournament, known as los cachirules. In that time,\nthe U.S. team was formed mainly by college and semi-professional players. They\nstarted by losing 1\u20130 to Costa Rica, then they got revenge by beating Costa\nRica 1\u20130, tied 1\u20131 against Trinidad and Tobago, won 2\u20131 against Guatemala and\nwon 1\u20130 against El Salvador. After scoreless draws against both Guatemala and\nEl Salvador, the situation of the group was as follows: The United States\nneeded a win in order to qualify for the World Cup because a loss or a draw\nwould allow Trinidad and Tobago to qualify. Costa Rica had already\nmathematically qualified for the tournament in Italy.\n\n## Match\n\nThe game was played on November 19, 1989 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium in\nPort of Spain. The stadium was painted red, as an homage to the Strike Squad\nas the Trinidad and Tobago team was then known as. In the first minutes, John\nHarkes tried unsuccessfully to score. Trinidad and Tobago's Elliot Allen had\ntwo attempts on goal. At the 30th minute, Bruce Murray passed the ball to Paul\nCaligiuri, who dodged a rival defender and with a left-footed shot scored 1\u20130\nfor the United States. Trinidadian goalkeeper Michael Maurice waited for the\nball practically standing on the goal-line, but he couldn't see it, arguing\nthat the sun had blinded him. In the second half, the Trinidadian team went\ninto attack in order to get a draw, but their efforts were in vain, as\nAmerican goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to stop Trinidad and Tobago's\nattempts. After the final whistle, the U.S. celebrated the victory while\nTrinidad and Tobago was left in consternation.\n\n### Details\n\n## Post-match\n\nAfter game, the group results were as follows: Due to the political situation\nin El Salvador and the fact that El Salvador and Guatemala had no chances to\nqualify for the World Cup, the matches still to be played between El Salvador\nand Guatemala were cancelled. The U.S. press, considering the significance of\nthe result, described Caligiuri's goal as \"the shot heard 'round the world\".\nAfter 36 years of absences from the World Cup, the U.S. team qualified for the\n1990 World Cup but its participation in the tournament was brief. They lost\n1\u20135 to Czechoslovakia, 0\u20131 against hosts Italy, and 1\u20132 against Austria. The\nU.S. would consecutively qualify for the next six subsequent World Cups, and\ncouldn't keep the streak going until 2018, because they lost 2\u20131 to Trinidad\nand Tobago during their final qualification game. Trinidad and Tobago suffered\na protracted crisis of confidence until their own World Cup dream finally came\ntrue in 2005, after beating Bahrain 2\u20131 on aggregate in an intercontinental\nplay-off, which allowed the Soca Warriors to qualify to the 2006 FIFA World\nCup in Germany. Yorke and Latapy (survivors of the qualifying campaign of\n1989) were part of that Trinidadian team, which in that World Cup drew against\nSweden 0\u20130 and lost against England 2\u20130 and Paraguay 2\u20130, being eliminated in\nthe first round.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20131 United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Concord Hymn\n\n\"Concord Hymn\" (original title was \"Hymn: Sung at the Completion of the\nConcord Monument, April 19, 1836\") is a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson written\nfor the 1837 dedication of the Obelisk, a monument in Concord, Massachusetts,\ncommemorating the Battle of Concord, the second in a series of battles and\nskirmishes on April 19, 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution.\n\n## History\n\nIn October 1834, Emerson went to live with his step-grandfather Ezra Ripley in\nConcord, at what was later named The Old Manse-- less than a hundred paces\nfrom the spot where the battle took place. In 1835, he purchased a home on the\nCambridge and Concord Turnpike and quickly became one of Concord's leading\ncitizens. That same year he was asked to give a public lecture commemorating\nthe town's 200th anniversary. The \"Concord Hymn\" was written at the request of\nthe Battle Monument Committee. At Concord's Independence Day celebration on\nJuly 4, 1837, it was first read, then sung as a hymn by a local choir using\nthe then-familiar tune \"Old Hundredth\". The poem elevates the battle above a\nsimple event, setting Concord as the spiritual center of the American nation,\nremoves specific details about the battle itself, and exalts a general spirit\nof revolution and freedom-- a spirit Emerson hoped would outlive those who\nfought in the battle. One source of the hymn's power may be Emerson's personal\nties to the subject: his grandfather William Emerson, Sr., witnessed the\nbattle at the North Bridge while living at the Old Manse. Emerson's poem was\nwidely published in newspaper accounts of the dedication; in contrast there is\nno record of Congressman Samuel Hoar's speech that day. The poem, originally\nprinted as a broadside for distribution at the monument's dedication, was\nrepublished as the last poem in Emerson's first edition of Poems in December\n1848 (the book, however, was dated 1847). In that edition the poem appeared\nwith the three line title \"HYMN: / SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD\nMONUMENT, / April 19, 1836.\" Emerson apparently confused the date of the 1837\ndedication a decade earlier, July 4, Independence Day with the anniversary of\nthe battle, April 19, Patriots' Day and the inscription on the obelisk\nmentions that it was erected in 1836. Emerson's line \"the shot heard round the\nworld\" is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution, and the opening\nstanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French The Minute Man statue\ndedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875\ncommemoration of the original battle. \"Concord Hymn\" established Emerson as a\npoet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist. Emerson biographer\nRobert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he\never wrote. Concord's centennial celebration of Emerson's birth in 1903 ended\nwith a singing of the hymn.\n\n## Text\n\nBy the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April\u2019s breeze\nunfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard\nround the world. The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror\nsilent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which\nseaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set today a votive\nstone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are\ngone. Spirit, that made those heroes dare, To die, and leave their children\nfree, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Shot Heard Round the World\" at Minute Man National Historical Park\n  * Choir from Concord sings Concord Hymn.

      "# Moment of truth (marketing)\n\nMoment of truth (MOT) in marketing, is the moment when a customer/user\ninteracts with a brand, product or service to form or change an impression\nabout that particular brand, product or service. In 2005 A.G. Lafley\nChairman,President & CEO of Procter & Gamble coined two \"Moments of Truth\". A\nthird was introduced later.\n\n## Types of MOT\n\n  * First moment of truth (FMOT): When a customer is first confronted with the product, taking place either offline or online. It occurs within the first 3-7 seconds of a consumer encountering the product and it is during this time that marketers have the capability of turning a browser into a buyer . Procter & Gamble describe the first moment of truth as the \"moment a consumer chooses a product over the other competitors offerings\".\n  * Second moment of truth (SMOT): When a customer purchases a product and experiences its quality as per the promise of the brand.. There can be multiple second moments of truth for every time the product is consumed (used), providing the consumer with information for future purchases and for sharing their experience with the product/service.\n  * Third moment of truth (TMOT): Consumers feedback or reaction towards a brand, product or service i.e. consumer becomes brand advocate and gives back via word of mouth or social media publishing.\n  * Zero moment of truth (ZMOT) is a term coined by Google in 2011, it refers to the research which is conducted online about a product or service before taking any action i.e. searching for mobile reviews before making a purchase. The internet has changed altogether the way consumers are interacting with brands, products or services this online decision-making moment is termed as ZMOT. According to research conducted by Google, 88% of US customers are researching online before actually buying the product.\n  * Actual moment of truth was identified by Amit Sharma, Founder & CEO of Narvar, to describe the new post-purchase experience gap created by the advent of online shopping, after a consumer has made a purchase but before they've received the product.\n\n## Further reading\n\n  * Moments of Truth by Jan Carlzon\n\np Marketing and Customer Relationship Managemen\"t by Annekie Brink & Adele\nBerndt\n\n  * [https://\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# List of presidents of the United States\n\nThe president of the United States is the head of state and head of government\nof the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term by the people\nthrough the Electoral College. The officeholder leads the executive branch of\nthe federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States\nArmed Forces.

Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office (the only\npresident to have done so) and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th\npresident of the United States; the 45th and current president is Donald Trump\n(since January 20, 2017). There are currently four living former presidents.\nThe most recent former president to die was George H. W. Bush, on November 30,\n2018. The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking\noffice in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt\nserved the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term\nin 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.\nSince the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States\nConstitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice and\nno one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was\nelected may be elected more than once. Of those who have served as the\nnation's president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry\nHarrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four\nwere assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and\nJohn F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment). John\nTyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a\npresidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so\nbecomes the fully functioning president with his own presidency, as opposed to\na caretaker president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution put\nTyler's precedent into law in 1967. It also established a mechanism by which\nan intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon\nwas the first president to fill a vacancy under this provision when he\nselected Gerald Ford for the office following Spiro Agnew's resignation in\n1973. The following year, Ford became the second to do so when he chose Nelson\nRockefeller to succeed him after he acceded to the presidency. As no mechanism\nexisted for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency prior to\n1967, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing\npresidential election and subsequent inauguration. Throughout most of its\nhistory, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The\nConstitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it\ncame into force in 1789, there were no parties. Soon after the 1st Congress\nconvened, factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration\nofficials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Greatly concerned\nabout the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding\nthe nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political\nfaction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains,\nthe only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.\n\n## Presidents\n\n## Subsequent public office\n\nThree presidents held another U.S. federal office after serving as president.\nTwo presidents campaigned unsuccessfully for other U.S. state or federal\nelective offices after serving as president. Many presidents have campaigned\nunsuccessfully for another term as president. Five did so after a gap of at\nleast one term since they served:\n\n## See also\n\n  * Acting president of the United States\n  * Founding Fathers of the United States\n  * List of presidents of the Continental Congress\n  * List of vice presidents of the United States\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Whitehouse.gov: The Presidents\n  * [http://hauensteincenter.org/ Hauenstein Center | Presidential Leadership Studies] at Grand Valley State University\n\n",
      "# T-bone steak\n\nThe T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called\nthe sirloin in Commonwealth countries and Ireland). Both steaks include a\n\"T\"-shaped lumbar vertebra with sections of abdominal internal oblique muscle\non each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin\nand thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the\nbone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and\ncontain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when\nsold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if cut from the small\nforward end of the tenderloin. There is little agreement among experts on how\nlarge the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture's Institutional Meat Purchase\nSpecifications state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least\nwide at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least wide. However,\nsteaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \"T-bone\" in restaurants and\nsteakhouses despite technically being porterhouse. Owing to their large size\nand the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef\n(the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered\none of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly\nhigh. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger\ntenderloin. In the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting\nclassification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173. In British usage,\nfollowed in the Commonwealth countries, \"porterhouse\" often means a British\nsirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin\non the other side of T-bone. However, nowadays some British on-line butchers\nalso offer American style porterhouse steaks. In New Zealand and Australia, a\nPorterhouse is striploin steak off the bone.\n\n## \"Porterhouse\" etymology\n\nThe origin of the term \"porterhouse\" is contentious, with several cities and\nestablishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary\ntraces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in\nhis Pearl Street (Manhattan) \"Porter House\" around 1814, while noting the lack\nof contemporary evidence to support the tale. This origin story gained\ntraction in the late 19th century. Some sources contend a Cambridge,\nMassachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent\nhis name to the cut of beef. In that era (late 18th to early 20th century),\nPorter Square was flanked by cattle yards that used the Porter rail head to\ntransport their beef throughout the US. Still others claim the steak takes its\nname from various other 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter\nHouse, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.\n\n## Anatomy of the T-bone\n\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half\nthrough the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse\nprocess of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles.\nThe small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\n\n## Preparation\n\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods,\nsuch as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen\nrelative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize\nthe meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more\nevenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat\nnear the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the\ntenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.\n\n### Bistecca alla fiorentina\n\nBistecca alla fiorentina, or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a\nT-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of\ncattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or\ncharcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil,\napplied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and\nvery large, \"Bistecca\" are often shared between two or more persons, and\ntraditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not\naccompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.\n\n### Cotoletta di Vitello alla Milanese\n\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for Cotoletta alla milanese,\nwhich consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and\nfried in clarified butter with salt.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of steak dishes\n  * Meat on the bone\n  * Rib eye steak\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  *  \n  * Porter House name origin article\n\n"

      "# France national under-21 football team\n\nThe France national under-21 football team (), known in France as Les Espoirs\n(, The Hopes), is the national under-21 football team of France and is\ncontrolled by the French Football Federation. The team competes in the UEFA\nEuropean Under-21 Football Championship, held every two years. Following the\nrealignment of UEFA's youth competitions in 1976, under-21 football teams in\nEurope were formed. The team is exclusively for football players that are age\n21 or under at the start of the two-year campaign of the UEFA European\nUnder-21 Football Championship meaning a player can represent the national\nteam until the age of 23. France has won the UEFA European Under-21 Football\nChampionship once in 1988. Notable players on the team that went on to play\nfor the senior national team include Laurent Blanc, Eric Cantona, Franck\nSauz\u00e9e, and Jocelyn Angloma, among others. Blanc was named the tournament's\nGolden Player. The team's best finish since was in 2002 when the team finished\nrunner-up to the Czech Republic in Switzerland. The France under-21 team does\nnot have a permanent home. The team plays in stadiums located all around\nFrance, particularly grounds of Ligue 2 clubs. Because of the smaller demand\ncompared to the senior national team, smaller facilities are used.

The\nteam's next match was two years later suffering a 3\u20131 defeat to Italy in\nVicenza. For the rest of the decade, the youth team played seven more matches,\nwhich included a 1\u20131 draw with Hungary in Budapest and a 2\u20130 loss to England\nin Sunderland in 1959. In the 1960s, Espoirs continued to play matches against\nfellow national youth sides. However, on 18 December 1968, the team contested\na match against Algeria senior team in Algiers recording an impressive 5\u20132\nvictory. Four days later, the team draw 1\u20131 with the under-23 team of Algeria\nin Oran. On 12 February 1969, the Espoirs played the Hungary senior team at\nthe Stade Gerland in Lyon.

      "# List of FIFA World Cup finals\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition\nestablished in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the\nmembers of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the\nsport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four\nyears, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to\nWorld War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by\nFrance, who beat Croatia 4\u20132 in regulation time. The World Cup final match is\nthe last of the competition, and the result determines which country is\ndeclared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a\ndraw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If\nsuch a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty\nshoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.\nThe tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except\n1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group\ncontested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2\u20131\nvictory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of\nthe tournament) that put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished\ntop of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA\nas the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup. In the 21 tournaments held, 79\nnations have appeared at least once. Of these, 13 have made it to the final\nmatch, and eight have won. With five titles, Brazil is the most successful\nWorld Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World\nCup finals tournament. Italy and Germany have four titles.

      "# Lewis Dunk\n\nLewis Carl Dunk (born 21 November 1991) is an English professional footballer\nwho plays as a centre back for club Brighton & Hove Albion, for whom he is\ncaptain, and the England national team. He is currently valued at \u00a350 million.\nAside from a brief loan spell at Bristol City in 2013, Dunk has spent the\nentirety of his career at Brighton & Hove Albion.

      "# List of England international footballers\n\nThe England national football team represents the country of England in\ninternational association football. It is fielded by The Football Association,\nthe governing body of football in England, and competes as a member of the\nUnion of European Football Associations (UEFA), which encompasses the\ncountries of Europe. England competed in the first official international\nfootball match on 30 November 1872, a 0\u20130 draw with Scotland at Hamilton\nCrescent. England have competed in numerous competitions, and all players who\nhave played in 10 or more matches, either as a member of the starting eleven\nor as a substitute, are listed below. Each player's details include his\nplaying position while with the team, the number of caps earned and goals\nscored in all international matches, and details of the first and most recent\nmatches played in. The names are initially ordered by number of caps (in\ndescending order), then by date of debut, then by alphabetical order. All\nstatistics are correct up to and including the match played on 17 November\n2019.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe first player to be capped 10 times by England was Norman Bailey, who\nplayed his 10th match in an 8\u20131 away win against Ireland on 23 February 1884\nin the 1883\u201384 British Home Championship. His final match, in which he earned\nhis 19th cap, was the 3\u20131 home defeat to Scotland on 19 March 1887. The\nappearance record is held by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, which he set on 7 June\n1989 in a 1\u20131 away draw with Denmark in a friendly. Shilton's last match for\nEngland was the third-place match against Italy on 7 July 1990 in the 1990\nFIFA World Cup, finishing his England career on 125 caps. The goalscoring\nrecord is held by Wayne Rooney, with 53 goals in 120 matches, scored between\n2003 and 2018. He set the record with his 50th goal on 8 September 2015, in a\n2\u20130 home win over Switzerland in a UEFA 2016 qualifier. England's second\nhighest goalscorer is Bobby Charlton, with 49 goals from 106 matches, who held\nthe record for 45 years before being surpassed by Rooney. England's highest\nscorer in FIFA World Cup finals matches is Gary Lineker, with ten goals, and\nthe highest scorer in UEFA European Championship finals matches is Alan\nShearer, with seven goals.\n\n## Key\n\n## Players\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of England international footballers with one cap\n  * List of England international footballers (2\u20133 caps)\n  * List of England international footballers (4\u20139 caps)\n  * List of England national football team World Cup and European Championship squads\n  * List of England national football team captains\n\n## References\n\n"

    "question": "Who did the shot heard round the world in 1775?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Shot heard round the world\n\n\"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase that refers to the opening shot\nof the Battle of Concord in 1775, which began the American Revolutionary War\nand led to the creation of the United States of America. The phrase has\nsubsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.\n\n## Skirmish at the North Bridge\n\nThe phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord\nHymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the\nOld North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers\nfell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically,\nno single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots\nwere fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans\nwere killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that\nevent are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the\nfirst shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by\nAmericans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat. The\ntowns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the\nRevolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns.\nHe was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \"birthplace of\nAmerican liberty\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \"first\nforcible resistance\" was made there. President Ulysses S. Grant considered not\nattending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In\n1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as\n\"Lexington Day\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday\nis Patriots' Day. Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time\nwhen he was composing the \"Concord Hymn\", from which his grandfather and\nfather (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located\napproximately from the North Bridge.\n\n## Assassination of Franz Ferdinand\n\nThe phrase \"shot heard round the world\" (alternatively \"shots heard round the\nworld\" or \"shot heard around the world\") has also become associated with the\nassassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June\n1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I.\nSerbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's\nwife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke\nhimself. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,\npropelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.\n\n## Widespread idiomatic use\n\nThe phrase \"Shot heard round the world\" continues to be a stock phrase in the\n21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general. The\nphrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history. In\nbaseball, the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" refers to the game-winning walk-\noff home run by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers\npitcher Ralph Branca to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951.\nThe Giants won the game 5\u20134 as a result of the home run, defeating their\ntraditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually\nlost the World Series to the Yankees. In association football, the shot heard\nround the world refers to Paul Caligiuri's winning goal for the United States\nmen's national soccer team in the final qualifying round for the 1990 FIFA\nWorld Cup on 19 November 1989. The US had not qualified for the World Cup\nsince 1950. The team was in third position of the CONCACAF playoffs before\ntheir final game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The US had to\nwin to go to the finals, their opponents only needed a draw. Defensive\nmidfielder Caliguri, the only full-professional player in the team, received\nthe ball 40 yards out from goal, and instead of passing it to a striker, beat\none defender and launched a 30-yard shot that looped into goal.\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Shot heard round the world (soccer)\n\nThe \"Shot heard round the world\" is a term used in reference to one of the\nmost historic goals in U.S. soccer history, which allowed the U.S. national\nteam to make it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup after 36 years of failed attempts\nto qualify. This goal was scored in the qualification game between United\nStates and Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989 in Port of Spain. The U.S.\nteam had not qualified for a FIFA World Cup since 1950, and the U.S. (having\nbeing selected by FIFA in 1988 to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup) wanted to give\na good impression to the world of soccer by qualifying to the 1990 World Cup.\n\n## Background\n\nThe United States was one of the five nations competing in the final round of\nCONCACAF's qualifiers for two spots at the upcoming World Cup in Italy, the\nother involved nations being Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Trinidad &\nTobago. Mexico was disqualified due to a scandal related with the age\nadulteration for a youth tournament, known as los cachirules. In that time,\nthe U.S. team was formed mainly by college and semi-professional players. They\nstarted by losing 1\u20130 to Costa Rica, then they got revenge by beating Costa\nRica 1\u20130, tied 1\u20131 against Trinidad and Tobago, won 2\u20131 against Guatemala and\nwon 1\u20130 against El Salvador. After scoreless draws against both Guatemala and\nEl Salvador, the situation of the group was as follows: The United States\nneeded a win in order to qualify for the World Cup because a loss or a draw\nwould allow Trinidad and Tobago to qualify. Costa Rica had already\nmathematically qualified for the tournament in Italy.\n\n## Match\n\nThe game was played on November 19, 1989 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium in\nPort of Spain. The stadium was painted red, as an homage to the Strike Squad\nas the Trinidad and Tobago team was then known as. In the first minutes, John\nHarkes tried unsuccessfully to score. Trinidad and Tobago's Elliot Allen had\ntwo attempts on goal. At the 30th minute, Bruce Murray passed the ball to Paul\nCaligiuri, who dodged a rival defender and with a left-footed shot scored 1\u20130\nfor the United States. Trinidadian goalkeeper Michael Maurice waited for the\nball practically standing on the goal-line, but he couldn't see it, arguing\nthat the sun had blinded him. In the second half, the Trinidadian team went\ninto attack in order to get a draw, but their efforts were in vain, as\nAmerican goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to stop Trinidad and Tobago's\nattempts. After the final whistle, the U.S. celebrated the victory while\nTrinidad and Tobago was left in consternation.\n\n### Details\n\n## Post-match\n\nAfter game, the group results were as follows: Due to the political situation\nin El Salvador and the fact that El Salvador and Guatemala had no chances to\nqualify for the World Cup, the matches still to be played between El Salvador\nand Guatemala were cancelled. The U.S. press, considering the significance of\nthe result, described Caligiuri's goal as \"the shot heard 'round the world\".\nAfter 36 years of absences from the World Cup, the U.S. team qualified for the\n1990 World Cup but its participation in the tournament was brief. They lost\n1\u20135 to Czechoslovakia, 0\u20131 against hosts Italy, and 1\u20132 against Austria. The\nU.S. would consecutively qualify for the next six subsequent World Cups, and\ncouldn't keep the streak going until 2018, because they lost 2\u20131 to Trinidad\nand Tobago during their final qualification game. Trinidad and Tobago suffered\na protracted crisis of confidence until their own World Cup dream finally came\ntrue in 2005, after beating Bahrain 2\u20131 on aggregate in an intercontinental\nplay-off, which allowed the Soca Warriors to qualify to the 2006 FIFA World\nCup in Germany. Yorke and Latapy (survivors of the qualifying campaign of\n1989) were part of that Trinidadian team, which in that World Cup drew against\nSweden 0\u20130 and lost against England 2\u20130 and Paraguay 2\u20130, being eliminated in\nthe first round.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20131 United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Concord Hymn\n\n\"Concord Hymn\" (original title was \"Hymn: Sung at the Completion of the\nConcord Monument, April 19, 1836\") is a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson written\nfor the 1837 dedication of the Obelisk, a monument in Concord, Massachusetts,\ncommemorating the Battle of Concord, the second in a series of battles and\nskirmishes on April 19, 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution.\n\n## History\n\nIn October 1834, Emerson went to live with his step-grandfather Ezra Ripley in\nConcord, at what was later named The Old Manse-- less than a hundred paces\nfrom the spot where the battle took place. In 1835, he purchased a home on the\nCambridge and Concord Turnpike and quickly became one of Concord's leading\ncitizens. That same year he was asked to give a public lecture commemorating\nthe town's 200th anniversary. The \"Concord Hymn\" was written at the request of\nthe Battle Monument Committee. At Concord's Independence Day celebration on\nJuly 4, 1837, it was first read, then sung as a hymn by a local choir using\nthe then-familiar tune \"Old Hundredth\". The poem elevates the battle above a\nsimple event, setting Concord as the spiritual center of the American nation,\nremoves specific details about the battle itself, and exalts a general spirit\nof revolution and freedom-- a spirit Emerson hoped would outlive those who\nfought in the battle. One source of the hymn's power may be Emerson's personal\nties to the subject: his grandfather William Emerson, Sr., witnessed the\nbattle at the North Bridge while living at the Old Manse. Emerson's poem was\nwidely published in newspaper accounts of the dedication; in contrast there is\nno record of Congressman Samuel Hoar's speech that day. The poem, originally\nprinted as a broadside for distribution at the monument's dedication, was\nrepublished as the last poem in Emerson's first edition of Poems in December\n1848 (the book, however, was dated 1847). In that edition the poem appeared\nwith the three line title \"HYMN: / SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD\nMONUMENT, / April 19, 1836.\" Emerson apparently confused the date of the 1837\ndedication a decade earlier, July 4, Independence Day with the anniversary of\nthe battle, April 19, Patriots' Day and the inscription on the obelisk\nmentions that it was erected in 1836. Emerson's line \"the shot heard round the\nworld\" is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution, and the opening\nstanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French The Minute Man statue\ndedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875\ncommemoration of the original battle. \"Concord Hymn\" established Emerson as a\npoet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist. Emerson biographer\nRobert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he\never wrote. Concord's centennial celebration of Emerson's birth in 1903 ended\nwith a singing of the hymn.\n\n## Text\n\nBy the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April\u2019s breeze\nunfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard\nround the world. The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror\nsilent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which\nseaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set today a votive\nstone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are\ngone. Spirit, that made those heroes dare, To die, and leave their children\nfree, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Shot Heard Round the World\" at Minute Man National Historical Park\n  * Choir from Concord sings Concord Hymn.

      "# Chess World Cup 2019\n\nThe Chess World Cup 2019 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament\nthat took place in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, from 9 September to 4 October\n2019. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. Radjabov and the\nrunner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the\nWorld Chess Championship 2020. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nLevon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the\nquarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave on tiebreaks.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Teimour Radjabov in the semi-finals.\nMaxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Yu Yangyi, to claim 3rd place. This tournament\nalso saw Jeffery Xiong (31st seed) progress far, being knocked out in the\nquarter finals to the ultimate champion/winner Teimour Radjabov.\n\n## Bidding process\n\nThere was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad\nevents, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation.\n\n## Format\n\nThe tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round\n6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40\nmoves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30\nseconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of\nfour classical games. If the score is tied after the classical games, rapid\nand, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are\nplayed with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment.\nIn the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10\nminutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two\nblitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied\n4\u20134 after all these games, a single \"Armageddon\" game is played: the player\nwho wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per\ngame and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting\nfrom move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black\nadvances if they win or the game is drawn. The two top finishers qualified for\nthe 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be\nthe top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because\nCarlsen as World Champion does not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had\nalready qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the\nWorld Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the\nprevious edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana\nboth declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply\nthe two finalists.\n\n## Schedule\n\nEach of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular\ntime limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final\nround has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for\ntiebreaks, if required.\n\n  * Round 1: 10 September \u2013 12 September\n  * Round 2: 13 September \u2013 15 September\n  * Round 3: 16 September \u2013 18 September\n  * Rest day: 19 September\n  * Round 4: 20 September \u2013 22 September\n  * Round 5: 23 September \u2013 25 September\n  * Round 6: 26 September \u2013 28 September\n  * Rest day: 29 September\n  * Final and play-off for third place: 30 September \u2013 4 October\n\n## Prize money\n\nThe total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000.\n\n## Participants\n\nThe participants were seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2019.

He also wrote the\nscreenplay for the films I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty,\nTeaching Mrs. Tingle (which he also directed) and Cursed.\n\n## Early life\n\nWilliamson was born in New Bern, North Carolina, the younger son of Faye and\nWade Williamson, a fisherman. He spent his early years in Aransas Pass, Texas,\nnear Corpus Christi, Texas. Williamson's family returned to North Carolina for\nhis high school years. He then attended East Carolina University in\nGreenville, North Carolina, where he received a BFA in Theatre Arts. He told\nEntertainment Weekly interviewer Melissa Maerz, \"When I was growing up, my mom\nand dad took me to the Poe museum in Richmond, Virginia. It was a little house\ndowntown, and The Raven was written on the walls. You had to move from room to\nroom to read the whole story. I thought it was the coolest thing in the\nworld.\"\n\n## Career\n\n### Early career (1990\u201395)\n\nAfter graduation, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. Though\nhe landed a part on the soap opera Another World in 1990, he moved to Los\nAngeles the following year where he had small parts in In Living Color, a\nRoger Corman film, Hard Run, and in music videos. While taking classes on\nscreenwriting at UCLA he wrote his first script, Killing Mrs. Tingle (later\nretitled Teaching Mrs. Tingle) which was bought by a production company in\n1995 and put on the shelf.\n\n### Mainstream breakthrough (1995\u201399)\n\n#### Scream\n\nInspired by the March 9, 1994, episode of the newsmagazine Turning Point on\nDanny Rolling, a serial killer in Gainesville, Florida, who preyed on college\nstudents, Williamson wrote a horror movie script, originally titled Scary\nMovie.

Miramax bought the script\nfor $400,000 for their new Dimension Films label in the spring of 1995.\nDirected by Wes Craven, the film was renamed Scream, and released in The\nUnited States on December 20, 1996. It became a commercial blockbuster and\ncritical success\u2014ultimately drawing $173 million in ticket sales worldwide.\nKevin Williamson earned the Saturn Award for Best Writing in 1996 for his work\non Scream. In 1997, Dimension Films released Scream 2, also written by\nWilliamson. It, too, was a critical and box office hit and paved the way for\ntwo more installments, Scream 3 (2000) and Scream 4 (2011). The latter was\nwritten by Williamson.\n\n#### Dawson's Creek\n\nPaul Stupin, an executive at Columbia TriStar Television, read Scream after\nthe bidding war for the script and was convinced Williamson was just the man\nto create a television series for his company. The result was Dawson's Creek,\na semi-autobiographical tale set in a small coastal community not unlike\nOriental. Williamson was the model for the title character, Dawson Leery, a\nhopeless romantic who is obsessed with movies\u2014especially those of Steven\nSpielberg. Joey Potter, the platonic girl-next-door, was based on a real life\nfriend of Williamson's when he was young. In December 1995, the show was\npitched to the Fox Network, where Stupin had been an executive, but it was\nrejected. Then in 1996, Stupin and Williamson went to, and struck a deal with,\nThe WB. Williamson said, \"I pitched it as Some Kind of Wonderful, meets Pump\nUp the Volume, meets James at 15, meets My So-Called Life, meets Little House\non the Prairie.\" Dawson's Creek premiered on The WB on January 20, 1998, and\nwas an immediate hit that helped launch the newly created television network.\nIn 1999, Williamson left the show to focus on other endeavors, among them\nABC's Wasteland, which failed to attract a sizable audience and was canceled\nafter its thirteen-episode first season. He later returned to Dawson's Creek\nto pen the two-part series finale in 2003.\n\n#### I Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nIn 1997, Williamson penned his next film, I Know What You Did Last Summer,\nbased on a 1973 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. Centered on four high\nschool friends who accidentally run over a man and dump his body in an attempt\nto go on with their lives, the plot focuses on the four friends a year after\nthe accident when they become the victims of a serial stalker. Despite\nreceiving negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success and\nhelped launch the careers of actors Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze, Jr.,\nSarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe, going on to spawn two sequels,\nneither of which Williamson was involved with.\n\n### Later work (1999\u20132009)\n\nWilliamson gave up the job of writing the full script for Scream 3 in order to\ndirect his first penned script, originally titled Killing Mrs. Tingle and\ninspired by Lois Duncan's novel Killing Mr. Griffin. Starring Dawson's Creek's\nKatie Holmes, Barry Watson, and Helen Mirren, Teaching Mrs. Tingle (as it was\nrenamed after the Columbine High School massacre) followed a group of students\ngetting even with their vindictive teacher. The film was neither a critical\nnor box office success. In 1999, Williamson created Wasteland, starring\nRebecca Gayheart. A late night, sexualized version of his earlier show,\nDawson's Creek, it aired for just 3 episodes in October 1999 before being\ncanceled. The remaining 10 episodes were aired on Showtime's ShowNext channel\nin 2001. In 2001, Williamson created Glory Days as a mid-season replacement\nfor The WB. The series followed a novelist returning to his hometown, a\ncoastal community within Washington state, which was experiencing strange\noccurrences\u2014seeming to mirror the plot ABC's Twin Peaks. Debuting in January\n2002, the series was canceled after the airing of nine episodes. Williamson\npenned another script which Wes Craven would go on to direct called Cursed,\nafter a failed first shoot starring an almost entirely different cast before\nre-writes and re-shoots turned the project into something new, it was finally\nreleased in 2005 and starred Christina Ricci, Jesse Eisenberg, Joshua Jackson,\nand Shannon Elizabeth. Due to the many script changes, delays in production\nand low promotional budget due to all the re-shoots, the film failed to\nperform at the box office. Later that same year, Dimension Films released\nWilliamson's horror film, Venom, about a group of teens stalked by a crazed\nkiller in the bayous of Louisiana. Williamson is listed as a producer of the\nfilm, but not as a writer. The film opened to negative reviews and suffered at\nthe box office, taking in less than $900,000 in gross revenue. In 2006,\nWilliamson began production on a new teen drama, tentatively titled Palm\nSprings, for The CW, the successor to the WB network. Later retitled Hidden\nPalms, the series was a coming-of-age drama about a troubled teen who moves\nwith his mother and new stepfather to a gated community in Palm Springs,\nCalifornia, where he uncovers dark secrets about his neighbors and his home's\nprevious tenants. Hidden Palms was originally intended to be a midseason\nreplacement set to air in March but its timeslot was filled by instead. The\npilot eventually premiered on May 30, 2007, to favorable reviews. However,\nafter eight episodes, the series was canceled due to low viewership ratings.\nThe final episode aired on July 4, 2007.\n\n### Return and newfound success (2009\u2013present)\n\nWilliamson developed a new TV series for The CW entitled The Vampire Diaries,\nwhich was adapted from a novel series of the same name by L. J. Smith. The\nseries follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), who falls in love with\nvampire Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), and soon finds herself caught in a\nlove triangle between Stefan and his older brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder),\nwhile the brothers are also being haunted by the past they've had with\nKatherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev). The series also focuses on the lives\nof Elena's friends and other inhabitants of the fictional town of Mystic\nFalls, Virginia. The Vampire Diaries premiered on September 10, 2009, and has\nbecome a domestic and international hit. Williamson developed a new TV series\nfor The CW entitled The Secret Circle, which was from another book series of\nVampire Diaries writer, L. J. Smith. The series revolves around six teenage\nwitches who form a Circle coven on the fictional town of Chance Harbor,\nWashington. The Secret Circle premiered on September 15, 2011, just after the\nthird-season premiere of The Vampire Diaries. It was pickup for a full-season\non October 12, 2011. It was eventually cancelled. Williamson was the writer\nand producer for Scream 4, which began shooting in June 2010 and was released\nin theaters on April 15, 2011. Williamson created the TV series The Following,\nwhich began airing on Fox in the 2012\u201313 television season. Starring\ncritically acclaimed actor Kevin Bacon, the series follows an ex-FBI agent who\nfinds himself in the middle of a network of serial killers. The series was\ncancelled by Fox on May 8, 2015, however it was reported the series was being\nshopped to Hulu for a possible fourth season. Williamson also created Stalker,\na psychological thriller centered on a pair of detectives who handle stalking\nincidents for the Threat Management Unit of the LAPD. The pilot was directed\nby Liz Friedlander and starred Dylan McDermott and Maggie Q. The series was\ncancelled on May 11, 2015 after one season. It was reported Warner Bros. would\npossibly shop the series around. In 2017, Williamson developed Time After\nTime, based on the novel of the same name, with the plot reset in 2017 New\nYork City. It ran for only 3 of its produced 12 episodes before being\ncancelled. In 2018, Williamson created Tell Me a Story, a psychological\nthriller based on the Mexican television series \u00c9rase una vez, who takes \"the\nworld\u2019s most beloved fairy tales and reimagines them as a dark and twisted\npsychological thriller. The pilot was also directed by Friedlander (who also\ndirected episodes of The Vampire Diaries, The Following and Stalker for\nWilliamson) and starred James Wolk, Billy Magnussen, Dania Ramirez, Kim\nCattrall, Danielle Campbell and Paul Wesley. The latter was one of the main\nactors in Williamson's previous show, The Vampire Diaires. The show began\nairing on CBS All Access in October 31, 2018.\n\n## Personal life\n\nWilliamson is openly gay. He came out to his friends and family in 1992.

      "# LGBT rights in Burkina Faso\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) persons in Burkina Faso may face\nlegal issues not experienced by non-LGBT citizens. Same-sex sexual acts\nbetween men and between women are legal in Burkina Faso.\n\n## Laws regarding same-sex sexual acts\n\nBoth male and female same-sex sexual activity has always been legal in Burkina\nFaso. Age of consent is equal, regardless of sex since 1996.\n\n## Recognition of same-sex unions\n\nThe Constitution of Burkina Faso does not authorize same-sex marriage and\ndefines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. La famille est la\ncellule de base de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019Etat lui doit protection. Le mariage est\nfond\u00e9 sur le libre consentement de l\u2019homme et de la femme. Toute\ndiscrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019ethnie, la\ncaste, l\u2019origine sociale, la fortune est interdite en mati\u00e8re de mariage. Les\nenfants sont \u00e9gaux en droits et en devoirs dans leurs relations familiales.\nLes parents ont le droit naturel et le devoir d\u2019\u00e9lever et d\u2019\u00e9duquer leurs\nenfants.

Marriage is based on the free consent of man and woman. Any\ndiscrimination based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, caste, social\norigin, fortune is forbidden in marriage. Children are equal in rights and\nduties in family relationships. Parents have the natural right and duty to\nbring up and educate their children. They owe them respect and assistance.\"\n\n## Adoption and family planning\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, \"Married, cohabiting, heterosexual\ncouples who have been married for at least five years may adopt a child.\nSingle applicants are almost never permitted to adopt children in Burkina\nFaso.\"\n\n## Living conditions\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report found that, The law\ndoes not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in employment and\noccupation, housing, statelessness, or access to education or health care.\nHowever, societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender\nidentity remained a problem. Religious and traditional beliefs do not accept\nhomosexuality, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons were\nreportedly occasional victims of verbal and physical abuse. There were no\nreports that the government responded to societal violence and discrimination\nagainst such persons. LGBT organizations had no legal presence in the country\nbut existed unofficially. There were no reports of government or societal\nviolence against such organizations.\n\n### HIV/AIDS\n\nHIV/AIDS has a relatively low presence in Burkina Faso when compared to other\nAfrican nations, with 0.80% of adults aged 15\u201349 infected by the virus.\nHowever, HIV remains a threat to the approximately 94,000 people infected as\nan estimated 65% of adult citizens living with HIV in Burkina Faso have access\nto antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, only 28% of children aged 0\u201314 have\naccess to antiretroviral drugs, a number that trails many African nations.\nDespite this, antiretroviral coverage has significantly improved in the\ncountry, as the estimated coverage for all ages was 32% in 2010.\n\n## Summary table\n\n## See also\n\n  * Human rights in Burkina Faso\n  * LGBT rights in Africa\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Ross Bagdasarian Jr.\n\nRoss Dickran Bagdasarian (born May 6, 1949) is an American actor, animator,\nvoice actor, singer, and record producer, best known for his work on the Alvin\nand the Chipmunks franchise. He is the son of the franchise's creator, Ross\nBagdasarian. He is often called Ross Bagdasarian Jr. to distinguish himself\nfrom his father, but he does not share his father's name; the elder\nBagdasarian's given name was Rostom.\n\n## Early life\n\nBagdasarian was born in Fresno, California, the son of Armenuhi (n\u00e9e\nKulhanjian) and Ross Bagdasarian Sr. He is of Armenian descent. As a child, he\nworked with his father on The Alvin Show by helping edit and coordinate the\nsoundtracks and falsetto voice-overs of The Chipmunks.\n\n## Career\n\nBagdasarian went to law school but after his father's death in 1972, succeeded\nhim as the President of Bagdasarian Productions, which had fallen into\nobscurity after significant success between 1958 and the late 1960s. His wife\nJanice Karman, whom he married in 1979, is co-president. Bagdasarian and\nKarman have two children and live in Montecito, California. Under\nBagdasarian's supervision, new Chipmunks records were created shortly after\nhis marriage to Karman, including Chipmunk Punk. In 1981, the Chipmunks\nreturned to television in the cartoon special A Chipmunk Christmas. Two years\nlater, Ruby-Spears Productions' Alvin and the Chipmunks Saturday morning\ncartoon series debuted on NBC. Based on that series, a feature film, The\nChipmunk Adventure was released in 1987. Bagdasarian voices Alvin, Simon, and\nDave Seville, and Karman voices Theodore and The Chipettes (Brittany,\nJeanette, and Eleanor). Bagdasarian and Karman hold tight creative and\nfinancial control over the Chipmunk franchise, reviewing each and every\nbusiness contract in great detail. In the mid-90s, Bagdasarian bought the\nChipmunk rights from brother Adam and sister Carol (a stay-at-home mother), to\ntake complete control.\n\n### Universal Pictures lawsuit\n\nBagdasarian licensed the rights to the Chipmunk characters to Universal\nPictures in 1996, resulting in a string of Universal-produced direct-to-video\nfilms. Four years later, he and Karman sued them for breach of contract,\nclaiming that Universal failed to properly utilize, market, and merchandise\nthe characters and hence resulting in a loss of royalties to Bagdasarian. The\ncase was decided in Bagdasarian's favor. \"For us, it was a custody battle\",\nKarman said. \"They finally realized 'OK, these two are really fighting for\ntheir kids'.\"\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n### Television\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * History at Chipmunks.com\n\n",

His girlfriend Brittany is in the final process of\nbreaking up with him [tracks 4 and 10]. Coming home to a dirty room, he is so\ndepressed after seeing his guests imitate his mischief that he loses touch\nwith reality and sinks into fairy tale addiction [track 5], refusing to clean\nhis room in the process. At Charlie Daniels's urging, he starts to be nice to\nhis brothers, but the conversation between them results in the unloading of a\nlot of unpleasant memories [track 6]. He does a concert in Nashville, but\ncannot resist destroying his and his brothers' instruments [tracks 7-8].\nGrounded for his recent acts of mischief, he tries to hook up with Waylon\nJennings, but Mr. Jennings turns down his overtures and badmouths his natural\nbehavior [track 9].

      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Sway (Rolling Stones song)\n\n\"Sway\" is a song by English rock band the Rolling Stones from their 1971 album\nSticky Fingers. It was also released as the b-side of the \"Wild Horses\" single\nin June 1971. This single was released in the US only. Initial pressings of\nthe single contain an alternate take; later pressings include the album\nversion instead.\n\n## Background\n\nCredited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \"Sway\" is a slower blues song and\nwas the first song recorded by the band at Stargroves. The song features a\nbottleneck slide guitar solo during the bridge and a dramatic, virtuoso outro\nsolo (both performed by Mick Taylor). Rhythm guitar performed by Jagger was\nhis first electric guitar performance on an album. The strings on the piece\nwere arranged by Paul Buckmaster, who also worked on \"Moonlight Mile\", another\nsong from Sticky Fingers. Richards added his backing vocals but provided no\nguitar to the track. Pete Townshend, Billy Nichols and Ronnie Lane are\nbelieved to contribute backing vocals as well. Taylor would later claim that\nhe felt he deserved writing credits on Sway and a few other songs, and the\nfact that he did not receive them was one of the causes of his departure from\nthe band.\n\n## Live\n\nIt was performed live for the first time in Columbus, Ohio, and then at many\nof the shows on the band's A Bigger Bang Tour in 2006. A seven-minute version\nof \"Sway\" appears on the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor Live at the Roxy album (also\nknown as Too Hot for Snakes). Taylor gets to stretch out and solo whereas the\nStones version faded at just under four minutes. Ian McLagan plays piano on\nthis version. During the Stones' \"50 & Counting\" concert tour in 2013, the\nband, accompanied by their guest Mick Taylor, played \"Sway\" during concerts at\nLos Angeles, Chicago and Boston. These concerts marked the first time that\nTaylor played on \"Sway\" at a Stones concert.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Mick Jaggerlead vocals, rhythm guitar\n  * Keith Richardsbacking vocals\n  * Mick Taylorlead guitar, slide guitar\n  * Bill Wymanbass guitar\n  * Charlie Wattsdrums\n  * Paul Buckmasterstring arrangement\n  * Nicky Hopkinspiano\n\n## Cover versions\n\nThe song was covered by the band Overwhelming Colorfast on the 1996\ncompilation album . It was also covered by Alvin Youngblood Hart on the\nOctober 1997 River North Records release, Paint It Blue: Songs Of The Rolling\nStones. Albert Castiglia covered the track on his 2014 album, Solid Ground.\nCarla Olson and Mick Taylor recorded a live version for their album Live: Too\nHot for Snakes.\n\n## References\n\n",

He was rehomed with Gill Raddings, a stunt dog specialist in Clifton,\nOxfordshire, after some friends of hers found the dog while out walking dogs\nof their own. The police were going to place him in kennels, so Raddings took\nin the stray. Raddings runs a company called Action Stunt Dogs and Animals,\nand other dogs living at her home with Sykes included Kyte, the Belgian\nShepherd who portrayed Wellard in EastEnders. Although he was a cross-breed,\nhis owner believed that there might have been some Parson Russell Terrier\nstock in him due to his long legs.\n\n## Career\n\nIn 2004, Sykes worked in his first movie, Alexander.

      "# List of Roseanne episodes\n\nRoseanne is an American television sitcom that was originally broadcast on ABC\nfrom October 18, 1988, to May 20, 1997 with a revival season that premiered in\n2018. Lauded for its realistic portrayal of the average American family, the\nseries stars Roseanne Barr, and revolves around the Conners, an Illinois\nworking-class family. In the ninth season, Roseanne and her family win the\nlottery and associate with \"high society\". In the final episode Roseanne\nreveals not only was she writing a story and they did not win the lottery, but\nalso says Dan had actually died from a heart attack in season 8. In season 10\nit is revealed that Dan did not die - Roseanne fabricated that as well, along\nwith a multitude of other things. This set most things back as they were in\nseason 9, with the exception of the birth of Darlene's daughter. Barr said the\nlottery storyline was done to illustrate the American Dream philosophy. On May\n16, 2017, it was announced ABC would produce an eight-episode 10th season\nrevival of the series, set to air as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with\nthe original cast returning.

On March 30, 2018, the series was\nrenewed for an eleventh season of 13 episodes by ABC, but was canceled on May\n29, 2018 due to a controversial joke made by Roseanne on Twitter about Obama\naide Valerie Jarrett. On June 21, 2018, the show was revived as a spin-off\nentitled The Conners, which has the same cast as Roseanne after her character\ndies of a drug overdose.

      "# You'll Never Walk Alone\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" is a show tune from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein\nmusical Carousel. In the second act of the musical, Nettie Fowler, the cousin\nof the protagonist Julie Jordan, sings \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" to comfort\nand encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, falls on\nhis knife and dies after a failed robbery attempt. It is reprised in the final\nscene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise (Billy and Julie's\ndaughter) is a member. The now invisible Billy, who has been granted the\nchance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself, watches the\nceremony and is able to silently motivate the unhappy Louise to join in the\nsong. The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world,\nwhere it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday; this\ntradition developed at Liverpool F.C. after the chart success of the 1963\nsingle of the song by the local Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers.\n\n## Background\n\nChristine Johnson, who created the role of Nettie Fowler, introduced the song\nin the original Broadway production. Later in the show Jan Clayton, as Julie\nJordan, reprised it, with the chorus joining in. In the film, it is first sung\nby Claramae Turner as Nettie. The weeping Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones) tries\nto sing it but cannot; it is later reprised by Julie and those attending the\ngraduation.\n\n## Subsequent history\n\nBesides the recordings of the song on the Carousel cast albums and the film\nsoundtrack, the song has been recorded by many artists, with notable hit\nversions made by Roy Hamilton, Frank Sinatra, Roy Orbison, Billy Eckstine,\nGerry and the Pacemakers, Lee Towers, Judy Garland, Elvis Presley, Johnny\nCash, Andy Williams, Glen Campbell, Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge,\nOlivia Newton-John and Doris Day. Progressive rock group Pink Floyd took a\nrecording by the Liverpool Kop choir, and \"interpolated\" it into their own\nsong, \"Fearless\", on their 1971 album Meddle. From 1964 through 2010, Jerry\nLewis concluded the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day MDA Telethon by singing the\nsong. After the end of a concert by the rock band Queen, the audience\nspontaneously sang this song, according to lead guitarist Brian May, and this\nhelped to inspire the creation of their songs \"We Are the Champions\" and \"We\nWill Rock You\". Italian-American tenor Sergio Franchi sang a notable version\naccompanied by the Welsh Men's Choir on the 9 June 1968 telecast of The Ed\nSullivan Show. He also covered this song in his 1964 RCA Victor album The\nExciting Voice of Sergio Franchi. In 1990 at the concert at Wembley Stadium,\nLondon, the audience spontaneously broke out into a mass rendition. Mandela\nturned to Adelaide Tambo who accompanied him onto the stage and asked what the\nsong was. She replied, \"A football song\". American singer Barbra Streisand\nperformed this song in a surprise appearance at the close of the 2001 Emmy\nAwards, in honor of the victims of the September 11 attacks. To mark the first\nanniversary of the attacks, Ren\u00e9e Fleming sang the song at the Concert for\nAmerica. Fleming sang the song again at the Inauguration of Barack Obama on\nJanuary 20, 2009. In 2010, the song was sung during the Last Night of the\nProms, with the choir at the Royal Albert Hall in London joined by crowds of\nthe public from Hillsborough Castle, Northern Ireland; Caird Hall, Dundee;\nHyde Park, London; Salford, Greater Manchester; and Wales, to mark the\nfiftieth anniversary of the death of Oscar Hammerstein II. It has been the\nsong of the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps song since 1954, where they\nfirst performed it as a part of their first field show in 1954. Challenged by\nthe Rosemont Cavaliers singing \"Over the Rainbow\" in 1957, the corps responded\nwith \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", and it has been the official corps song ever\nsince. Punk band Dropkick Murphys covered the song for their 2017 album 11\nShort Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey said in a December\n2016 interview discussing the reason behind their version. \"As you may know,\nopiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston)\narea. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my\ncousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. I was leaving\none of the wakes and this song came on and as I was listening to the lyrics it\nsummed up exactly how I was feeling. Sad, but knowing there is hope. You never\nhave to be alone. I hope you like our version\". Lee Towers has been performing\nthe song from an aerial work platform at the start of every Rotterdam Marathon\nsince 1995.\n\n## Sporting anthem\n\n### Liverpool F.C.\n\nIn the UK, the song's most successful cover was released in 1963 by the\nLiverpudlian Merseybeat group Gerry and the Pacemakers, peaking at number one\non the UK singles chart for four consecutive weeks. Sung by Liverpool fans in\n1963, the song quickly became the football anthem of Liverpool F.C., which\nadopted \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" as its official motto on its coat of arms.\nThe song is sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game\nat Anfield with the Gerry and the Pacemakers version played over the public\naddress system. According to former player Tommy Smith, lead vocalist Gerry\nMarsden presented Liverpool manager Bill Shankly with a recording of his\nforthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963.\n\"Shanks was in awe of what he heard. ... Football writers from the local\nnewspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind\nbetween games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had\nadopted Gerry Marsden's forthcoming single as the club song.\" The squad was\nsubsequently invited to perform the track with the band on The Ed Sullivan\nShow with Marsden stating, \"Bill came up to me. He said, 'Gerry my son, I have\ngiven you a football team and you have given us a song'.\" Shankly picked the\nsong as his eighth and final selection for the BBC's Desert Island Discs on\nthe eve of the 1965 FA Cup Final. As Liverpool fans sang \"You'll Never Walk\nAlone\" at Wembley during the 1965 FA Cup Final win over Leeds, commentator\nKenneth Wolstenholme referred to it as \"Liverpool's signature tune\". Marsden\ntold BBC Radio how, in the 1960s, the disc jockey at Anfield would play the\ntop ten commercial records in descending order, with the number one single\nplayed last, shortly before kickoff. Liverpool fans on the Kop would sing\nalong, but unlike with other hit singles, once \"You'll Never Walk Alone\"\ndropped out of the top ten, instead of disregarding the song, supporters\ncontinued to sing it. In his commentary on the memorial service following the\nHillsborough disaster in 1989, Peter Jones recited the lyrics, which were then\nsung by a cathedral choir. Aretha Franklin's recording of the song was played\nby John Peel in his first show following the disaster, when he became too\nupset to carry on broadcasting for a period. In 2019, during a Take That\nconcert at Anfield, lead singer and Liverpool fan Gary Barlow brought out a\nguest vocalist, Gerry Marsden \u2013 who had come out of retirement for the\nperformance \u2013 and they sang the club's anthem \u201cYou'll Never Walk Alone\u201d.\n\n### Other teams\n\nThe song was adopted by Scottish team Celtic after a 1966 Cup Winners Cup\nsemi-final against Liverpool at Anfield, and is now sung by Celtic fans prior\nto every home European tie, and later by Germany's Borussia Dortmund who\nLiverpool went on to play in the cup final. The song has also been adopted by\nDutch team FC Twente after it was officially given to them by the former\nAnfield stadium speaker George Septhon during the last game in the Diekman\nstadium, before moving to the new Arke Stadion. Today, Twente fans sing the\nsong before every home game. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, Feyenoord and SC\nCambuur have adopted the song as well. Additional football teams which now use\nthe song include 1. FSV Mainz 05, TSV 1860 Munich, Belgium's Club Brugge KV,\nJapan's F.C. Tokyo, Spain's CD Lugo, Greece's PAOK and Indonesia's Bali\nUnited. In ice hockey, the song has been adopted by German Deutsche Eishockey\nLiga side Krefeld Pinguine and Croatian Medve\u0161\u010dak Zagreb. A special recording\nof the song was made in solidarity with Bradford City following the Valley\nParade fire in 1985, when 56 spectators died and many more were seriously\ninjured. The song was performed by The Crowd, which was a supergroup featuring\nGerry Marsden, Paul McCartney and others, and spent two weeks at number one in\nthe UK. Some years later, after witnessing a rendition of \"You'll Never Walk\nAlone\" at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee,\nAlejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to his country's\nwordless national anthem, the Marcha Real, ahead of Madrid's bid to host the\n2016 Olympic Games. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, legislator Tam Yiu\nChung quoted the song during a Legislative Council of Hong Kong meeting, to\nsalute the Hong Kong Police, who had received widespread criticism for using\nexcessive force against pro-democracy protesters. More than 2,000 Liverpool\nFootball Club fans in Hong Kong condemned his inappropriate use of the song,\ncomparing his support of the police action to the police actions in the 1989\nHillsborough disaster, where South Yorkshire Police were found to have\ndistorted facts relating to the unlawful killing by negligence of 96 Liverpool\nsupporters. On 13 March 2016, after Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 win against 1. FSV\nMainz 05 in the German Bundesliga, supporters of both teams performed the song\nto commemorate a Dortmund fan who died from a cardiac arrest in the stands\nduring the game.\n\n## Recorded versions\n\n  * The Adicts\n  * Alfie Boe (\"Onward\") (2007)\n  * Alicia Keys (Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, 2005)\n  * Andr\u00e9 Rieu (2009 Maastricht concert)\n  * Andy Williams (with orchestra conducted by Archie Bleyer)\n  * Aretha Franklin (1972, on the live album Amazing Grace)\n  * Barry Manilow & Cilla Black (1993)\n  * Bela B. & the Tikiwolves feat.

She is best known,\nhowever, for creating the role of Nettie Fowler in the original Broadway\nproduction of Carousel.\n\n## Life and career\n\nJohnson was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky and moved to Owensboro, Kentucky\nafter her freshman year of high school, graduating from Owensboro High School\nin 1929. She showed early promise, starring in school plays and singing in\nchurches. After high school, she studied voice at the Nashville Conservatory\nof Music and sang for radio station WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Johnson moved\nto New York City in 1937 and began to work with NBC's Radio City Music Hall\nand Lyn Murray and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at CBS, sometimes touring\nin concerts in North America. She studied voice and operatic repertoire in New\nYork with Ernst Knoth and Sidney Dietch. In 1941, she sang Dorabella in Cos\u00ec\nfan tutte, opening the Tanglewood opera house at Lenox, Massachusetts. In\n1942, she received good notices for the role of Mrs. Page in The Merry Wives\nof Windsor. Other roles followed for her, with the New Opera Company of New\nYork under Emil Cooper, at San Francisco Opera and elsewhere, in Macbeth, The\nFair at Sorochyntsi, The Queen of Spades, Cavalleria rusticana, Carmen, La\nforza del destino, The Girl of the Golden West, the title role in Roberta,\nAzucena in Il trovatore and Maddalena in Rigoletto. During this period, she\nalso sang at New York's Town Hall. In 1943, Johnson won the Metropolitan Opera\nAuditions of the Air which led to her becoming the youngest person ever to\nsing the role of Erda in Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold at that opera house.\nShe appeared on CBS radio's The Squibb Show twice in 1944. There she sang\n\"It's A Lovely Day\" and \"My Heart's in the Highlands\" with Lyn Murray and His\nOrchestra.

She\nrejoined Carousel during the national tour and continued as Nettie through its\nBroadway revival in 1949. After Carousel closed, Johnson moved back to\nOwensboro, where she married surgeon Robert Smith in 1950 and raised two\ndaughters, Robin and Nancy. She taught voice for many years, and one of her\npupils was Florence Henderson. She also served on local arts committees and\nparticipated in some local productions.

The group consisted of singers, actors, television personalities and\nothers. Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers had decided to make a\ncharity record to aid the families of the victims of the disaster (the\nBradford City Disaster Fund). The re-recording of the 1963 number 1 hit song\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" from the broadway musical Carousel, also a 'football\nanthem' for Liverpool supporters, entered the UK charts at No. 52, leaping to\nnumber 4 the following week and then reaching Number 1 on 1 June 1985. The\nrecord also topped the Irish Singles Chart. The single gave Gerry Marsden a\n'first' in British recording history, by becoming the first person ever to top\nthe charts with two versions of the same song.\n\n## Contributing musicians and celebrities\n\nThe band and celebrity members included: Bruce Forsyth, Denny Laine, Jim\nDiamond, Tony Christie, Rick Wakeman, John Conteh, The Barron Knights, Jess\nConrad, Kiki Dee, the Foxes, Rolf Harris, Graham Gouldman, Kenny Lynch, Rick\nWild of The Overlanders, Keith Chegwin, Tony Hicks, Colin Blunstone, Tim\nHinkley, Johnny Logan, Zak Starkey, Girlschool, Black Lace, John Otway, Gary\nHolton, Nigel Holton, Hank Hancocks, Peter Cook, the Nolans, John Entwistle of\nThe Who, Mot\u00f6rhead, Karen Clark, Dave Lee Travis, Graham Dene, Ed Stewart,\nPhil Lynott, Smokie, Joe Fagin, Eddie Hardin, Gerard Kenny, Chris Robinson,\nTim Healy, Kin Kelly, John Verity, Rose Marie, David Shilling, Chris Norman,\nPete Spencer, Bernie Winters, Robert Heaton, and Frank Allen of The Searchers.\nPaul McCartney contributed some words on the B-side of the record which was\ntitled \"Messages\".\n\n## See also\n\n  * Bradford City stadium fire\n  * Bradford City A.F.C.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Black Lace website\n\n",
      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# I'll Be Seeing You (song)\n\n\"I'll Be Seeing You\" is a popular song about nostalgia, with music by Sammy\nFain and lyrics by Irving Kahal. Published in 1938, it was inserted into the\nBroadway musical Right This Way, which closed after fifteen performances. The\ntitle of the 1944 film I'll Be Seeing You was taken from this song at the\nsuggestion of the film's producer, Dore Schary. The song is included in the\nfilm's soundtrack. The resemblance between the main tune's first four lines\nand a passage within the theme of the last movement of Gustav Mahler's Third\nSymphony (1896) was pointed out by Deryck Cooke in 1970. Mahler may have\nderived this passage from the overture to Daniel Auber's comic opera (Marco\nSpada (1852). Billie Holiday's 1944 recording of the song was the final\ntransmission sent by NASA to the Opportunity rover on Mars when its mission\nended on 13 February 2019.\n\n## Chart appearances\n\nThe recording by Bing Crosby became a hit in 1944, reaching number one for the\nweek of July 1. Frank Sinatra's version with Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra\nfrom 1940 charted in 1944 and peaked at No. 4. A recording by the Poni-Tails\nreached number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending November 16,\n1959.\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# I'll Be on My Way\n\n\"I'll Be on My Way\" is a song attributed to John Lennon and Paul McCartney,\nwhich was first released on 26 April 1963 by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas\nas the b-side of their single \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", a song also\nattributed to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The single reached number two in the UK charts\nwhile \"From Me to You\" by the Beatles was occupying the number 1 position.\nAccording to Lennon, the song was written by McCartney: \"This was early Paul.\"\nHowever, there is good evidence that Lennon also contributed to the song.\nAuthor Todd Compton attributes it to \"McCartney\u2013Lennon.\" The Beatles recorded\na version of the song, first released in 1994 on the Live at the BBC\ncompilation.\n\n## Background\n\nIn 1980 Lennon said \"that's Paul on the voids [joys] of driving through the\ncountry.\" \"I'll Be on My Way\" is considered to be the first song that Lennon\nand McCartney \"gave away,\" and the Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas' version\nof the song is included on the EMI album The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave\nAway. In 1963, the Beatles and Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas were both acts\nmanaged by Brian Epstein, with George Martin as their producer. The song may\nhave been influenced by the musical and lyrical style of Buddy Holly. The\npersona forces a happy-go-lucky view on his break-up to make himself feel\nbetter, similar in character to Holly's 1959 song \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore.\"\nAs of July 2019, Paul McCartney's MPL Music and John Lennon's Lenono Music\nowns the copyright on that song along with \"Please Please Me,\" \"Ask Me Why,\"\n\"Love Me Do,\" \"P.S. I Love You,\" and \"Do You Want To Know A Secret.\"\n\n## Recording\n\nThis song was recorded by the Beatles on 4 April 1963 at the BBC Paris\nTheatre, London, and broadcast on the BBC radio show Side by Side on 24 June\n1963. This is the only known recording of \"I'll Be on My Way\" by the Beatles;\nit features joint lead vocals by McCartney and Lennon, and can be heard on the\nBeatles' album Live at the BBC, where it is the only previously unreleased\noriginal song.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n"

In better times, AJ (Triple H) would\nhave done anything to protect his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), a two-\nbit gangster and the son of Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) -- the city's toughest crime\nboss. While A.J. is in prison, Jack marries Claire (Parker Posey), the love of\nAJ's life, and together they raise a daughter, Pepper (Juliette Goglia).\nPepper is A.J.'s daughter, a fact known to Jack, but Jack pretends to be her\nbiological father.

However, Eric Hynes of The\nVillage Voice was more positive, praising the film as a \"meandering,\neccentric, downright adorable existential crime yarn\", while noting that\nLevesque's performance was closer to \"a steroidal Steven Seagal\" than \"Hackman\nor Cagney\".\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",

A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny\nthat he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the\nboat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint\nBraden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden\nseducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by\nJohnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that\nthe gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does\nJohnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing\nwith Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees\nthe riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that\nFrankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in\nNew Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball.\nFrankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny\nis eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to\nFrankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie\nscheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins\n$10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he\ndiscovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a\nwindow, into the street. Blackie, a dim-witted stooge who works for the boss,\nhears Braden drunkenly complain about how he has lost Nellie. Thinking he can\nbe of help, Blackie switches the blank cartridge in Frankie's stage gun for a\nreal bullet. The boss tries to prevent the impending disaster, but arrives on\nstage too late and Johnny is shot for real. Frankie forgives his gambling as\nthe love of her life appears to be dying but he stands up, apparently unhurt.\nJohnny was saved because the bullet struck a lucky medallion he was wearing\nthat Frankie had given him.\n\n## Primary cast\n\n  * Elvis Presley as Johnny\n  * Donna Douglas as Frankie\n  * Harry Morgan as Cully\n  * Sue Ane Langdon as Mitzi\n  * Nancy Kovack as Nellie Bly\n  * Audrey Christie as Peg\n  * Anthony Eisley as Clint Braden\n  * Robert Strauss as Blackie\n  * Joyce Jameson as Abigail\n  * Naomi Stevens as Princess Zolita (uncredited)\n  * Dave Willock as the bartender (uncredited)\n\n## Production\n\nThere was discussion that Ann Margaret might play the female lead - she owed\nEdward Small a film under a contract with her. Filming started in May 1965 and\ntook place in Hollywood and New Orleans. Under his contract with United\nArtists, Presley was paid $700,000 plus 50% of the profits.\n\n## Reception\n\nHoward Thompson of The New York Times reported that the film opened with a\n\"dull thud\" and \"sheds feathers almost from the start\" stating that Presley's\nformula never before \"seemed so feeble and so obvious.\" Variety wrote that the\nfilm \"hits the mark as pleasant entertainment, and is certain to be another\nPresley money-winner.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times felt that despite\n\"generally mediocre production values\" particularly lacking in good dance\nnumbers, the film was \"fast-moving fun\" and a good vehicle for Presley. The\nMonthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"After a long series of lifeless flops, Elvis\nPresley is here right back on form; or at least the film round him is (Elvis\nhimself rarely changes) ... Although the story tends to sag a little during\nthe romantic complications, the script is pleasantly witty, with Henry Morgan\nand the enchanting Nancy Kovack outstanding.\"\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of American films of 1966\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Frankie and Johnny - Sergent.com.au\n\n",
      "# Baby mama\n\nA baby mama (also baby-mama and baby-mother) is a mother who is not married to\nher child's father, although the term is often infused with other meanings as\nwell.\n\n## Origin\n\nThe term originated in Jamaican Creole as \"baby-mother\" (pronounced ), with\nthe first printed usage appearing in the Kingston newspaper, The Daily Gleaner\nin 1966. Another Daily Gleaner use dates from November 21, 1989. Originally,\nthe term was used by the fathers of illegitimate children to describe the\nmothers of their children, but the term is now in general use to describe any\nsingle mother. Peter L. Patrick, a linguistics professor who studies Jamaican\nEnglish, has said of the terms baby mother and baby father, \"[they] definitely\nimply there is not a marriage\u2014not even a common-law marriage, but rather that\nthe child is an 'outside' child\". Since entering currency in U.S. tabloids,\nthe terms baby mama and baby daddy have even begun to be applied to married\nand engaged celebrities.\n\n## Usage\n\n### In music\n\nBaby mother and baby mama had entered wide use in American hip-hop lyrics by\nthe mid-1990s. One of the first representations of baby mamas in hip-hop\nlyrics was by southern rapper Krazy, from Tampa, Florida. One of his songs was\ntitled \"I Hate My Baby Mama.\" The Outkast song \"Ms. Jackson\", released in\n2000, was dedicated to \"all the baby mamas' mamas\". American Idol winner\nFantasia Barrino released a song entitled \"Baby Mama\" in 2004. In this song\nshe is writing an ode to black single mothers and how to be a baby mama should\nbe a \"badge of honor\". She makes firsthand acknowledgements as a single mother\nand empathizes on the thoughts of baby mamas and how they are \"fed up with\nmakin' beds up.\" Planet Earth, an album by Prince released in 2007, features a\nsong called \"Future Baby Mama\". Three 6 Mafia had a song called \"Baby Mama\" on\n. Tupac's \"Dear Mama\", and \"Brenda's got a Baby\" are two hip hop songs that\nshow a strong Black woman/ mothering trope. Through these albums and songs,\nthere has come to be an acceptance to the term \"Baby Mama\" and also a creation\nto an alternative baby daddy.\n\n### In television\n\nAll My Babies' Mamas was an unaired reality show starring rapper Shawty Lo,\nshowcasing his lifestyle as the father of 11 children, mothered by 10\ndifferent women.\n\n### In film\n\nIn 2008, Universal Pictures released a comedy entitled Baby Mama starring Tina\nFey and Amy Poehler, in which Poehler plays a woman Fey hires to be her\nsurrogate. In many films, including some like Tyler Perry's \"Meet the Browns\",\nthat was released in 2008, there are many stereotypical representations of\nblack baby mamas. Brenda, who is played by Angela Bassett, is one of the main\ncharacters in the film that is portrayed as a stereotypical Black single\nmother who is caught in an endless cycle of poverty and struggle. She has\nthree children from three different men, none of which have a presence in\ntheir child's life. Throughout the film there is not indication that Brenda is\non welfare but nevertheless, she is a clear representation of a contemporary\n\"baby mama\". In stereo-typically fashion her character is someone who is\npowerless.\n\n## References\n\n"

    "question": "What is the mlb record for most hits in a row?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# Hitting streak\n\nIn baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in\nwhich a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According to the\nOfficial Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarily ended when a player\nhas at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated\nif all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch,\ndefensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the\nplayer has a sacrifice fly and no hit. Joe DiMaggio holds the Major League\nBaseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on\nMay 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak (91-for-223),\nwith 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in.\n\n## Major League Baseball records\n\nThere have been 55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a\nhitting streak of at least 30 games. Multiple streaks in the same season have\noccurred in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and\nBenito Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar, Jr.), 1999\n(Vladimir Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras),\nand 2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole\nstreak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar\nevent occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the end\nof another (Jimmy Rollins). Keeler's streak started in his final game of the\n1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season.\nRollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through\nthe first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of\n1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball recognizes two\nhitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest\nhitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005\u20132006). Keeler's,\nSisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when\ndiscussing single-season streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing\nmultiple-season streaks. This list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American\nAssociation Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887,\nthe major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which\nwas dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season,\nbut his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only \"hits\" were\nwalks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so\nLyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists.\nIn 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the\nstatistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand,\neven in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the\nruling affects only hit totals for the year; the batting champion for the year\nis not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-\nseason average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.\nTy Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple\nstreaks of 30 games or longer.

      "# List of New York Yankees team records\n\nThe New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx, New\nYork. They compete in the East Division of Major League Baseball's (MLB)\nAmerican League (AL). The club began play in 1903 as the Highlanders, after\nowners Frank Farrell and William S. Devery had bought the defunct Baltimore\nOrioles and moved the team to New York City; in 1913, the team changed its\nnickname to the Yankees. From 1903 to 2019, the franchise has won more than\n10,000 games and 27 World Series championships. The list below documents\nplayers and teams that hold particular club records. Outfielder Babe Ruth\nholds the most franchise records, with 16, including career home runs, and\ncareer and single-season batting average and on-base percentage. Shortstop\nDerek Jeter has the second-most records among hitters, with eight. Jeter's\nmarks include the records for career hits, singles, doubles, and stolen bases.\nAmong pitchers, Whitey Ford has the most Yankees records with five, all of\nwhich are career totals. These include games won, games started, and innings\npitched. Several Yankees hold AL and MLB records. Ruth has MLB single-season\nrecords for extra-base hits and total bases, and holds four other AL single-\nseason records. Outfielder Joe DiMaggio had a 56-game hitting streak in the\n1941 season, which remains an MLB record. Jack Chesbro holds three AL records\nthat he set in 1904: games won, games started, and complete games.\n\n## Table key\n\nStatistics are current through the 2019 season.\n\n## Individual career records\n\nThese are records of players with the best performance in particular\nstatistical categories during their career with the Yankees.\n\n### Career batting\n\n### Career pitching\n\n## Individual single-season records\n\nThese are records of Yankees players with the best performance in particular\nstatistical categories during a single season.\n\n### Single-season batting\n\n### Single-season pitching\n\n## Team single-game records\n\nThese are records of Yankees teams with the best performance in particular\nstatistical categories during a single game.\n\n### Single-game batting\n\n### Single-game pitching\n\n### Other\n\n## Team season records\n\nThese are records of Yankees teams with the best and worst performances in\nparticular statistical categories during a single season.\n\n### Season batting\n\n### Season pitching\n\n## Team all-time records\n\n## See also\n\n  * Baseball statistics\n  * New York Yankees award winners and league leaders\n\n## Notes\n\n  * Earned run average is calculated as , where formula_1 is earned runs and formula_2 is innings pitched.\n  * The figure listed is the MLB total.

      "# Hitting streak\n\nIn baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in\nwhich a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According to the\nOfficial Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarily ended when a player\nhas at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated\nif all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch,\ndefensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the\nplayer has a sacrifice fly and no hit.

      "# Rock with You\n\n\"Rock with You\" is a song recorded by American singer Michael Jackson. It was\nwritten by Rod Temperton and produced by Quincy Jones. It was first offered to\nKaren Carpenter, while she was working on her first solo album, but she turned\nit down. It was released on November 3, 1979, by Epic Records as the second\nsingle from Jackson's fifth solo studio album Off the Wall (1979). It was also\nthe third number-one hit of the 1980s, a decade whose pop singles chart would\nsoon be dominated by Jackson. It reached number one on both the US Billboard\npop, becoming Jackson's third #1 single and it also reached the top spot on\nR&B; charts. On the former, \"Rock with You\" spent four consecutive weeks at\nnumber one starting January 19, 1980. According to Billboard, the song was the\nfourth biggest single of 1980. It is also considered one of the last hits of\nthe disco era. It was re-released as a single on February 27, 2006, as part of\nthe box set.\n\n## Composition\n\nThis song is written in the key of E minor. Meter is 4/4 at 114 bpm.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nAllMusic highlighted the song on the album itself. Robert Christgau called it\na \"smooth ballad\".\n\n## Music video\n\nA music video was released for the song, using the shorter single version. It\nfeatures Michael in a sparkly sequined suit singing the song with a bright\nlaser behind him. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers. The music video was\nincluded on the video albums: Video Greatest Hits - HIStory, Number Ones and\nMichael Jackson's Vision.\n\n## Live performances\n\nMichael first performed the song on the Jacksons' Destiny World Tour on the\nsecond leg. He performed the song on the Jacksons' Triumph Tour and Victory\nTour. He performed the song on his solo tour the Bad World Tour. He also\nperformed the song during the HIStory World Tour, as a part of the Off the\nWall medley (Also featuring Off the Wall and Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough)\nin certain concerts. \"Rock with You\" was rehearsed for the Dangerous World\nTour, but was not performed. Jackson also would have performed it for the This\nIs It concert series, but the shows were canceled, due to his sudden death.\n\n## Michael Jackson: The Experience\n\nThe song is also featured in the game .\n\n## Mixes\n\n  * Original LP version \u2013 3:39\n    * This \"classic\" version was only released on initial runs of the LP record and cassette, as well as certain CD pressings manufactured in Japan, up to and including a Japanese-market version released in 1991. It was replaced by the full version of the 7\" remix on later LP pressings and all other CD editions. The original version was later remastered and released on the \"French Fans' Selection\" deluxe box set edition of King of Pop.\n  * 7\" remix video edit \u2013 3:23\n    * The \"remix\" was used for the single and to underscore the video. The remix re-pans the guitar, and adds more strings, horns, and hand claps in the chorus. An edit was made to the middle musical bridge by adding fingersnaps and shortening it from two parts to just one.\n  * 7\" version \u2013 3:39\n    * This is the same as the 7\" remix, but with the musical bridge left intact. This version appears on later pressings of the album.\n  * Extended version \u2013 4:57\n    * Available only on the Japanese 12\" promo, \"Rock with You / Robin Hood\". The latter song was recorded by Fox and the Promes.\n  * Masters at Work Remix \u2013 5:29\n  * Frankie's Favorite Club Mix \u2013 7:49\n  * Frankie Knuckles Radio Mix \u2013 3:50\n    * The Masters at Work Remix and Frankie Knuckles remixes all contain previously unheard vocals and ad-libs not heard on the original album version. This is because the remixers were given access to the master tapes of the song to produce their remix. The master tapes contained additional vocals and cuts that didn't make it onto the original album version.\n  * Freemasons Bootleg Remix \u2013 5:44\n  * 2012 Reeno 12\" Remix \u2013 7:16\n    * Remix made from the original 48-track masters.

This mix also contains some previously unused string parts.\n  * Live 1981 (3:55)\n    * The live version, taken from the 1981 album The Jacksons Live!, was included on the UK 12\" \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" single in 1983.\n  * Live 1988 (4:05)\n    * The live version, included in the deluxe edition of Bad 25 and on the DVD Live at Wembley July 16, 1988, was recorded during one of the shows at Wembley Stadium during the Bad World Tour.\n\n## Track listing and formats\n\nEuropean 7\" vinyl single\n\n* A. \"Rock with You\" \u2013 3:38\n* B. \"Get on the Floor\" \u2013 4:44\n\nNetherlands 12\" vinyl single\n\n* A. \"Rock with You\" \u2013 3:20\n* B1. \"You Can't Win\" \u2013 7:17\n* B2. \"Get on the Floor\" \u2013 4:44\n\nUK 12\" vinyl single\n\n* A. \"Rock with You\" - 3:20\n* B1: \"You Can't Win\" - 7:17\n* B2: \"Get on the Floor\" - 4:44\n\nUS 7\" vinyl single\n\n* A. \"Rock with You\" \u2013 3:20\n* B. \"Working Day and Night\" \u2013 4:55\n\nVisionary DualDisc single\n\nCD side\n\n* \"Rock with You\" (single mix) \u2013 3:23\n* \"Rock with You\" (Masters at Work Remix) \u2013 5:33\n\nDVD side\n\n* \"Rock with You\" (video) \u2013 3:23\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * Written and composed by Rod Temperton\n  * Produced by Quincy Jones\n  * Recorded and Mixed by Bruce Swedien\n  * Michael Jackson - lead and backing vocals\n  * Bobby Watson - bass\n  * John Robinson - drums\n  * David Williams, Marlo Henderson - electric guitar\n  * Greg Phillinganes, Michael Boddicker - synthesizers\n  * David \"Hawk\" Wolinski - Fender Rhodes\n\n  * Horns arranged by Jerry Hey and performed by The Seawind Horns\n    * Jerry Hey - trumpet and flugelhorn\n    * Larry Williams - tenor, alto saxophones and flute\n    * Kim Hutchcroft - baritone, tenor saxophones and flute\n    * William Reichenbach - trombone\n    * Gary Grant - trumpet\n  * Rhythm and vocal arrangements by Rod Temperton\n  * String arrangement by Ben Wright\n  * Concert master - Gerald Vinci\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n### All-time charts\n\n## Certifications\n\n## See also\n\n    * List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1980\n    * List of number-one R&B; singles of 1980 (U.S.)\n    * List of number-one singles of 2006 (Spain)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J. Kramer version\n\nThe Beatles' version was never released as a single in the UK, where a cover\nversion by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (released b/w \"I'll Be on My Way\",\nParlophone R5023, 26 April 1963) reached number two in the Record Retailer\nchart, and hit number one in the NME chart (used by Radio Luxembourg) and the\nBBC's Pick of the Pops chart, which were more widely recognised at the time.\nIt appeared on his album, Little Children. It reached number eight in the\nIrish Singles Chart.\n\n### Chart performance\n\n## Other covers\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1964 album The Chipmunks\nSing the Beatles Hits. Santo and Johnny, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Mary\nWells, Keely Smith, Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee, The Johnny Mann Singers, The Ray\nCharles Singers, Sharon Clark, and The Hollyridge Strings also recorded the\nsong. Swedish actress and recording artist Anita Lindblom recorded a Swedish-\nlanguage version titled \"Lyssna (vill du veta vad jag t\u00e4nker?)\" for her 1968\nalbum S\u00e5n't \u00e4r livet. The song reached the No. 1 position on Billboard in 1981\nand No. 2 in the United Kingdom in a cover version by Stars on 45 as part of a\nmedley, \"Stars on 45\".\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Rock This Country Tour\n\nThe Rock This Country Tour was the third concert tour by Canadian recording\nartist Shania Twain. The tour was Twain's first tour in eleven years and was\nbilled as her farewell tour. The tour kicked off on June 5, 2015, in Seattle,\nand concluded in Kelowna on October 27, 2015. The trek preceded the release of\nTwain's fifth studio album. At the end of 2015, the tour placed 19th on\nPollstar's \"2015 Year-End Top 100 Worldwide Tours\" list, grossing $69 million\nfrom 69 shows with a total attendance of 703,148.\n\n## Background\n\nOn March 4, 2015, while appearing on Good Morning America, Twain announced the\ntour as well as her upcoming album. Since this is her last tour, Twain said\nthat she wants to go out on bang and she's \"ready to hang my hat up in that\nregard\", which is touring. Twain also shared that this going to \"be a real,\nkickin' hard-hitting, fun party show\".

After making her way through the\naudience during \"Any Man of Mine\", Twain disappears for a costume change while\nher seven-member band provides an interlude of her 2003 international hit \"Ka-\nChing!\". Accompanied by a flurry of pyrotechnics, Twain reappears on stage in\na black leather, body-hugging ensemble for \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\" After the\nbreezy \"Come On Over\" and opening act accompanied duet of \"Party for Two\",\nTwain takes a moment to chat with the audience about the voice struggles she\nhas had in recent years and how she thought she \"would never sing again\" and\nthat it is a \"miracle\" she made it back onstage. Exclaiming that \"there's no\nway but up from here\", Twain ascends into the air on a saddle that takes her\nin a long, slow circle above the audience as she sings \"Up!\". Once back\nonstage, Twain and her band begin an acoustic set, beginning with her most\nrecent single, 2011's \"Today Is Your Day\" and the infectious and light \"No One\nNeeds to Know\". Twain is then left alone on center stage with her guitar,\nsinging her biggest hit, 1998's multi-platinum and Grammy award-winning\n\"You're Still the One\".

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is\nas well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in\nBible classes and children's ministries.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Committee on Bible Translation (CBT)\n  * Biblica\n  * Michael Marlowe on the NIV\n  * Read the New International Version (NIV) Bible \n  * \"Is Your Modern Translation Corrupt?\", Dr. James R.

      "# New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\n\nThe New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of the\nChristian Bible was the first of three inclusive language versions of the New\nInternational Version (NIV). It was published by Hodder and Stoughton (a\nsubsidiary of Lagardere Publishing) in London in 1995; New Testament and\nPsalms, with the full bible following in 1996. It was only released in the\nUnited Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. In 1997, an article by\nWorld Magazine accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the\nevangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by\nJames Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI,\nZondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States. The front\ncover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from\nthe standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear\nit was a feminist/Inclusive Language version. One of the criticisms was that\nthe word \u2018man\u2019 was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way\n(\u2018anyone\u2019 \u2018person\u2019 etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation\nwith the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of\nthe word \u2018man\u2019. A corrected edition was published in 1999 as the last edition.\nIn 2002 Today's New International Version (TNIV) was published for the English\nspeaking world as a replacement, but differing in its title with the addition\nof 'Today's'. This was also discontinued, with a slightly toned-down version\nof the TNIV being published as the New International Version in 2011.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# International Bible College\n\nInternational Bible College was a Christian Bible College located on northwest\nof historic downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Founded by Leonard Coote in\n1942, International Bible College was among the oldest Christian Colleges in\nTexas and the Southwest before it closed in 2010.\n\n## History\n\nInternational Bible College (now defunct) in San Antonio, was founded by Rev.\nLeonard W. Coote, an Oneness Pentecostal missionary to Japan. In 1942, when\nWorld War II temporarily halted his missionary efforts with the Japan\nApostolic Mission, Coote moved to San Antonio and began Emmanuel Gospel\nTabernacle (now Destiny Church) as well as IBC. He had previously established\na Bible training school for native workers in Ikoma, Japan, and wanted to\nbuild a similar Bible training center in the United States. The school,\nchartered as a nonprofit institution and dependent on private contributions\nfor support, was situated on a ten-acre campus atop \"Hallelujah Hill,\"\noverlooking San Antonio.\n\n### Peak enrollment and development\n\nIn 1965, the campus included 14 buildings; the library contained 3,000\nvolumes. By 1967 the campus included 19 buildings; that number grew to 27 by\n1995. Curriculum offerings in 1967 were a 2\u00bd-year course leading to a\nChristian worker's certificate, a three-year ministerial diploma course, and\ntwo four-year bible college courses-one leading to the Bachelor of Theology\ndegree (BTh) and the other to the Bachelor of Religious Education degree\n(BRE). Eventually IBC came to consider itself a \"nonsectarian school\", and at\nthe time of its closing was affiliated with the Oral Roberts University\nEducational Fellowship (ORUEF). Enrollment in 2001 was 91 full-time-equivalent\nstudents; faculty numbered 21. David W. Cook served as president until 2010.\n\n### Loss of certification and decline\n\nIBC was never accredited by a regional accrediting body but did obtain a\ncertificate of authority from the State of Texas authorizing it to grant\nbachelor's degrees in 1976. In the mid 1980s IBC began to face scrutiny from\nthe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and was required to gain\naccreditation from an accrediting body recognized by the State of Texas. When\nthe school failed to gain accreditation it was stripped of its ability to\ngrant degrees when its final certification expired on March 8, 1992. The\nschool was forced to change its name from International Bible College to\nInternational Bible Center. Enrollment steadily declined after the\ncertification was lost until the school closed in the fall of 2010.\n\n## Degrees\n\nThroughout most of its history IBC offered two baccalaureate degrees: the\nBachelor of Theology degree and the Bachelor of Religious Education degree. A\ntotal of 120 semester hours were to be completed, and for many years a 10,000\nword thesis was required. In addition it offered a three-year ministerial\ndiploma and one year Bible course. When it lost its ability to grant degrees\nin 1992 it began offering a Certificate of Biblical Studies, which required 64\nsemester hours, and a Diploma of Advanced Biblical Studies, requiring 128\nsemester hours.\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n",
      "# Luke\u2013Acts\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is the composite work of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the\nApostles in the New Testament. Both of these books of the Bible are credited\nto Luke. They also describe the narrative of those who continued to spread\nChristianity, ministry of Jesus and the subsequent ministry of the apostles\nand the Apostolic Age.\n\n## Authorship\n\nBoth the books of Luke and Acts are narratives written to a man named\nTheophilus. The book of Acts starts out with: \"The former treatise have I\nmade\", probably referring to the Gospel of Luke. Scholars believe that they\nwere written by the same person. Luke\u2013Acts has sometimes been presented as a\nsingle book in published Bibles or New Testaments, for example, in The\nOriginal New Testament (1985) and The Books of the Bible (2007). Luke is the\nlongest of the four gospels and the longest book in the New Testament;\ntogether with Acts of the Apostles it makes up a two-volume work from the same\nauthor, called Luke\u2013Acts. The cornerstone of Luke\u2013Acts' theology is \"salvation\nhistory\", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he\nhas acted, and will continue to act, in history.\n\n## Composition and setting\n\nIt divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with\nthe gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the arrival among men of Jesus\nthe Messiah, from his birth to the beginning of his earthly mission in the\nmeeting with John the Baptist followed by his earthly ministry, Passion,\ndeath, and resurrection (concluding the gospel story per se). The gospel's\nsources are the Gospel of Mark (for the narrative of Christ's earthly life),\nthe sayings collection called the Q source (for his teachings), and a\ncollection of material called the L (for Luke) source, which is found only in\nthis gospel. The work is Hellenized and written for a gentile audience\npossibly, in part, to counter a gnostic understanding of history. Marcion, a\nfamous 2nd-century heretic, who used a modified form of Luke known as the\nGospel of Marcion, did not use Acts, perhaps because he was unaware of it or\nintentionally excluded it from his biblical canon; Irenaeus, a proto-orthodox\napologist, is the first to use and mention Acts, specifically against\nMarcionism. Some scholars note that there are two versions of Luke\u2013Acts with\nthe longer version 10\u201320 percent longer than the shorter version. Scholars\ndisagree on which came first.\n\n## See also\n\n  * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * Joseph B.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes.

She was also interviewed by Lowe and confirmed that her third\nsolo studio album was being completed.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Back to You\" was written by Amy Allen, Parrish Warrington, Diederik Van\nElsas, Micah Premnath, and Selena Gomez. The production was handled by\nTrackside and Ian Kirkpatrick, the latter also working on Gomez's previous\nsingle \"Bad Liar\". The track has been described as an emotional acoustic\nmidtempo with country influences, being also called a \"dance-pop anthem\", as\nwell as an electropop and EDM ballad. Gomez said that it was a \"very special\nrecord\" and that she wanted it to be \"a beautiful message in a really\ncomplicated way but really fun\". The song is performed in the key of F major\nwith a tempo of 102 beats per minute in 4/4 time and follows a chord\nprogression of Dm\u2013B\u2013F. Gomez\u2019 vocals span two octaves, from C to C.\n\n## Music video\n\nA lyric video with scenes of the second season of 13 Reasons Why was released\non May 10, 2018.\n\n### Release and synopsis\n\nThe official music video was directed by Scott Cudmore. The imagery for the\nmusic video is inspired from the 1965 French New Wave film Pierrot le Fou. The\nmusic video starts at a party with Gomez, dressed in a vintage feather-trimmed\ngreen sequined high-neck dress, locking eyes with a sharply suited man (Andrey\nKupchenko), and they steal a convertible and end up frolicking in a bucolic\npasture. Gomez wears an ensemble fit for the French countryside: a vintage\nwhite skirt and a sleeveless orange-and-yellow crop top. and take Gomez\u2019s\ntwist on iconic \u201960s French-girl style as some summer style inspiration.\nNevertheless, Gomez's video, is saturated with Godard's quintessential\nfilmmaking quirks: fragmented editing; characters breaking the fourth wall;\nmelodramatic dialogue; a garish, primary color-focused palette; and cartoonish\nneorealism. Cinemaphiles will immediately notice parallels, as the music\nvideo's opening visual directly mirrors the famous party scene in \"Pierrot le\nFou,\" both doused in deep, ever-changing colors. The inane dialogue from side\ncharacters serves to highlight the shallow, bourgeois lifestyle that Pierrot\nwants to escape from. The two find they are wanted and burn their car to\ndestroy the evidence. The video returns to the party from the start and\ndespite everything, Gomez cycles back, locks eyes with a sharply dressed man\nand asks: \"Do you want to steal a car?\".\n\n## Accolades\n\n## Track listing\n\n  * Digital download\n\n  1. \"Back to You\" \u2013 3:30 \n\n  * Riton and Kah-Lo Remix\n\n  1. \"Back to You\" (Riton and Kah-Lo Remix) \u2013 3:27 \n\n  * Joey Pecoraro Remix\n\n  1. \"Back to You\" (Joey Pecoraro Remix) \u2013 3:46 \n\n  * Anki Remix\n\n  1. \"Back to You\" (Anki Remix) \u2013 4:41 \n\n## Credits and personnel\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n  * Selena Gomez \u2013 vocals, songwriter\n  * Amy Allen \u2013 songwriter\n  * Parrish Warrington \u2013 songwriter\n  * Diederik Van Elsas \u2013 songwriter\n  * Micah Premnath \u2013 songwriter\n  * Trackside \u2013 producers\n  * Ian Kirkpatrick \u2013 producer\n  * Chris Gehringer \u2013 mastering engineer, studio personnel\n  * Tony Maserati \u2013 mixer, studio personnel\n\n## Charts\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## Certifications\n\n## Release history\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Tears Dry on Their Own\n\n\"Tears Dry on Their Own\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Amy\nWinehouse from her second and final studio album Back to Black (2006). \"Tears\nDry on Their Own\" was released as the fourth single from Back to Black on 13\nAugust 2007. While the melody and lyrics are composed by Winehouse, the music\nbehind her voice is a sample interpolation of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's\n1967 Motown classic hit \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", penned by the married\nduo of Ashford & Simpson.

Featuring Winehouse making her way down\nHollywood Blvd and in a dim motel room, the video features the Grand Motel at\n1479 S La Cienega Blvd, in Los Angeles.

      "# Brenda's Got a Baby\n\n\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is the second single by Tupac Shakur from his debut\nalbum 2Pacalypse Now. The song, which features R&B; singer Dave Hollister\nsinging background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl\nnamed Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song\nexplores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their\nfamilies. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the\nplight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in\ngeneral, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father,\nthe government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song while filming\nthe feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old\ngirl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash\ncompactor.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the\nrest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with\nTupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also\nnotes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a \"damn shame\"\nbecause she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her\nfather is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who\nis also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac\nexplains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got\ntheir cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin\n(her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is\nmerely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom\nfloor. She throws the baby into a 'trash heap' but later retrieves it when she\nhears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed\nof herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone,\nand unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results\nin robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn\nmoney and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of\nher parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final\nminute consists of a chorus singing \"Don't you know she's got a baby?\"\nrepeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song \"Street\nRiders\" 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals\nwith this same subject called \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\". The song can be\nfound on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what\nShakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and \"Brenda\" and then the actual\nstory starts. Ethel \"Edy\" Proctor portrays Brenda. The video begins with\n\"based on a true story,\" although the characters themselves are fictitious,\nShakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old\ngirl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a\ntrash can. Parts of the video were included in , a 2003 documentary on 2Pac's\nlife, in a television show later in the music video of \"Ghetto Gospel\", in the\nmusic video of \"Changes\" and appears as a bonus in its entirety on the film's\nDVD. Part of the video and song was played in 2Pac's biopic film, All Eyez on\nMe, released on June 16, 2017. The video was directed by the Hughes brothers.\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# The Silence of the Lambs (film)\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American psychological horror film directed\nby Jonathan Demme from a screenplay written by Ted Tally, adapted from Thomas\nHarris's 1988 novel of the same name. The film stars Jodie Foster, Anthony\nHopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Anthony Heald. In the film, Clarice\nStarling, a young FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Hannibal\nLecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer to apprehend\nanother serial killer, known only as \"Buffalo Bill\", who skins his female\nvictims' corpses. The novel was Harris's first and second respectively to\nfeature the characters of Starling and Lecter, and was the second adaptation\nof a Harris novel to feature Lecter, preceded by the Michael Mann-directed\nManhunter (1986). The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991\nand grossed $272.7 million worldwide against its $19 million budget, becoming\nthe fifth-highest grossing film of 1991 worldwide. The film premiered at the\n41st Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden\nBear, while Demme received the Silver Bear for Best Director. Critically\nacclaimed upon release, it became only the third film (the other two being It\nHappened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)) to win\nAcademy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Director,\nBest Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first\n(and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film,\nand one of only six such films to be nominated in the category, along with The\nExorcist (1973), Jaws (1975), The Sixth Sense (1999), Black Swan (2010) and\nGet Out (2017). It is regularly cited by critics, film directors and audiences\nalike as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. In 2018\nEmpire ranked it 48th on their list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.\nThe American Film Institute ranked it as the 5th greatest and most influential\nthriller film of all time while the characters Clarice Starling and Hannibal\nLecter were ranked as the greatest film heroine and villain respectively. The\nfilm is considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by\nthe U.S. Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the National\nFilm Registry in 2011. A sequel titled Hannibal was released in 2001, in which\nHopkins reprised his role. It was followed by two prequels: Red Dragon (2002)\nand Hannibal Rising (2007).\n\n## Plot\n\nFBI trainee Clarice Starling is pulled from her training at the FBI Academy at\nQuantico, Virginia by Jack Crawford of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit.\nHe assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and\nincarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in\nthe pursuit of a psychopath serial killer nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\", who kills\nyoung women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Starling travels to\nthe Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by\nFrederick Chilton to Lecter's solitary quarters. Although initially pleasant\nand courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at \"dissecting\"\nhim and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks semen at\nher. Lecter, who considers this act \"unspeakably ugly\", calls Starling back\nand tells her to seek out an old patient of his. This leads her to a storage\nshed, where she discovers a man's severed head with a sphinx moth lodged in\nits throat. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to\nBuffalo Bill. He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he may\nbe transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Buffalo Bill abducts a\nSenator's daughter, Catherine Martin. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer\nLecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information\nthat helps them find Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter\ndemands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues about Buffalo Bill in\nexchange for personal information. Starling tells Lecter about the murder of\nher father when she was ten years old. Chilton secretly records the\nconversation and reveals Starling's deceit before offering Lecter a deal of\nChilton's own making. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he verbally\ntorments Senator Ruth Martin, and gives her misleading information on Buffalo\nBill, including the name \"Louis Friend\". Starling notices that \"Louis Friend\"\nis an anagram of \"iron sulfide\"\u2013fool's gold. She visits Lecter, who is now\nbeing held in a cage-like cell in a Tennessee courthouse, and asks for the\ntruth. Lecter tells her that all the information she needs is contained in the\ncase file. Rather than give her the real name, he insists that they continue\ntheir quid pro quo and she recounts a traumatic childhood incident where she\nwas awakened by the sound of spring lambs being slaughtered on a relative's\nfarm in Montana. Starling admits that she still sometimes wakes thinking she\ncan hear lambs screaming, and Lecter speculates that she is motivated to save\nCatherine in the hope that it will end the nightmares. Lecter gives her back\nthe case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by\nChilton and the police, who escort her from the building. Later that evening,\nLecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears. Starling\nanalyzes Lecter's annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill\nknew his first victim personally. Starling travels to the victim's hometown\nand discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and dress patterns\nidentical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims. She\ntelephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to form a \"woman\nsuit\" out of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest,\nhaving cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding an\nautogynephilic man named Jame Gumb, who once applied unsuccessfully for a sex-\nchange operation, believing himself to be a transgender woman. Starling\ncontinues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio, while\nCrawford leads an FBI HRT team to Gumb's address in Illinois. The house in\nIllinois is empty, and Starling is led to the house of \"Jack Gordon\", whom she\nrealizes is actually Jame Gumb, again by finding a sphinx moth. She pursues\nhim into his multi-room basement, where she discovers that Catherine is still\nalive, but trapped in a dry well. After turning off the basement lights, Gumb\nstalks Starling in the dark with night-vision goggles, but gives his position\naway when he cocks his revolver. Starling reacts just in time and fires all of\nher rounds, killing Gumb. Sometime later, at the FBI Academy graduation party,\nStarling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini. He\nassures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the\nfavor, which she says she cannot do. Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying\nthat he is \"having an old friend for dinner\", and starts following a newly\narrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling\n    * Masha Skorobogatov as young Clarice\n  * Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter\n  * Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford\n  * Ted Levine as Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb\n  * Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton\n  * Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin\n  * Diane Baker as U.S. Senator Ruth Martin\n  * Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp\n  * Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews\n  * Tracey Walter as Lamar\n  * Charles Napier as Lt.

Prior to the novel's release, Orion Pictures\npartnered with Gene Hackman to bring the novel to the big screen. With Hackman\nset to direct and possibly star in the role of Crawford, negotiations were\nmade to split the $500,000 cost of rights between Hackman and the studio. In\naddition to securing the rights to the novel, producers also had to acquire\nthe rights to the name \"Hannibal Lecter\", which were owned by Manhunter\nproducer Dino De Laurentiis. Owing to the financial failure of the earlier\nfilm, De Laurentiis lent the character rights to Orion Pictures for free. In\nNovember 1987, Ted Tally was brought on to write the adaptation; Tally had\npreviously crossed paths with Harris many times, with his interest in adapting\nThe Silence of the Lambs originating from receiving an advance copy of the\nbook from Harris himself. When Tally was about halfway through with the first\ndraft, Hackman withdrew from the project and financing fell through. However,\nOrion Pictures co-founder Mike Medavoy assured Tally to keep writing as the\nstudio itself took care of financing and searched for a replacement director.\nAs a result, Orion Pictures sought director Jonathan Demme to helm the\nproject. With the screenplay not yet completed, Demme signed on after reading\nthe novel. From there, the project quickly took off, as Tally explained,\n\"[Demme] read my first draft not long after it was finished, and we met, then\nI was just startled by the speed of things. We met in May 1989 and were\nshooting in November. I don't remember any big revisions.\"\n\n### Casting\n\nJodie Foster was interested in playing the role of Clarice Starling\nimmediately after reading the novel. However, in spite of the fact that Foster\nhad just won an Academy Award for her performance in the film The Accused\n(1988), Demme was not convinced that she was right for the part. Having just\ncollaborated on Married to the Mob (1988), Demme's first choice for the role\nof Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer, who turned it down, later saying, \"It was a\ndifficult decision, but I got nervous about the subject matter\". Still not\nconvinced, he went to Meg Ryan who rejected it as well for its gruesome themes\nand then to Laura Dern, of whom the studio was skeptical as not being a\nbankable choice. As a result, Foster was awarded the role due to her passion\ntowards the character. For the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Demme originally\napproached Sean Connery. After the actor turned it down, Anthony Hopkins was\nthen offered the part based on his performance in The Elephant Man (1980).\nOther actors considered for the role included Al Pacino, Robert De Niro,\nDustin Hoffman, Derek Jacobi and Daniel Day-Lewis. The mask Hopkins wore\nbecame an iconic symbol for the movie. It was created by Ed Cubberly, of\nFrenchtown, NJ, who had made numerous masks for NHL goalies. Gene Hackman was\noriginally cast to play Jack Crawford, the Agent-in-Charge of the Behavioral\nScience Unit of the FBI in Quantico, Virginia but he found the script \"too\nviolent.\" Scott Glenn was then cast in the role. To prepare for the role,\nGlenn met with John E. Douglas. Douglas gave Glenn a tour of the Quantico\nfacility and also played for him an audio tape containing various recordings\nthat serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves\nraping and torturing a 16-year-old girl. According to Douglas, Glenn wept as\nhe experienced the recordings and even changed his liberal stance on the death\npenalty.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Silence of the Lambs began on November 15, 1989\nand concluded on March 1, 1990. Filming primarily took place in and around\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with some scenes shot in nearby northern West\nVirginia. The home of Buffalo Bill used for exterior scenes was in Layton,\nPennsylvania. The exterior of the Western Center near Canonsburg, Pennsylvania\nserved as the setting for Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.\nIn what was a rare act of cooperation at the time, the FBI allowed scenes to\nbe filmed at the FBI Academy in Quantico; some FBI staff members even acted in\nbit parts.\n\n### Music\n\nThe musical score for The Silence of the Lambs was composed by Howard Shore,\nwho would also go on to collaborate with Demme on Philadelphia. Recorded in\nMunich during the latter half of the summer of 1990, the score was performed\nby the Munich Symphony Orchestra. \"I tried to write in a way that goes right\ninto the fabric of the movie,\" explained Shore on his approach. \"I tried to\nmake the music just fit in. When you watch the movie you are not aware of the\nmusic. You get your feelings from all elements simultaneously, lighting,\ncinematography, costumes, acting, music. Jonathan Demme was very specific\nabout the music.\" A soundtrack album was released by MCA Records on February\n5, 1991. Music from the film was later used in the trailers for its 2001\nsequel, Hannibal.\n\n## Release\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991, grossing $14\nmillion during its opening weekend.

      "# The Silence of the Lambs (film)\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American psychological horror film directed\nby Jonathan Demme from a screenplay written by Ted Tally, adapted from Thomas\nHarris's 1988 novel of the same name. The film stars Jodie Foster, Anthony\nHopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Anthony Heald. In the film, Clarice\nStarling, a young FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Hannibal\nLecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer to apprehend\nanother serial killer, known only as \"Buffalo Bill\", who skins his female\nvictims' corpses. The novel was Harris's first and second respectively to\nfeature the characters of Starling and Lecter, and was the second adaptation\nof a Harris novel to feature Lecter, preceded by the Michael Mann-directed\nManhunter (1986). The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991\nand grossed $272.7 million worldwide against its $19 million budget, becoming\nthe fifth-highest grossing film of 1991 worldwide. The film premiered at the\n41st Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden\nBear, while Demme received the Silver Bear for Best Director. Critically\nacclaimed upon release, it became only the third film (the other two being It\nHappened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)) to win\nAcademy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Director,\nBest Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first\n(and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film,\nand one of only six such films to be nominated in the category, along with The\nExorcist (1973), Jaws (1975), The Sixth Sense (1999), Black Swan (2010) and\nGet Out (2017). It is regularly cited by critics, film directors and audiences\nalike as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. In 2018\nEmpire ranked it 48th on their list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.\nThe American Film Institute ranked it as the 5th greatest and most influential\nthriller film of all time while the characters Clarice Starling and Hannibal\nLecter were ranked as the greatest film heroine and villain respectively. The\nfilm is considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by\nthe U.S. Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the National\nFilm Registry in 2011. A sequel titled Hannibal was released in 2001, in which\nHopkins reprised his role. It was followed by two prequels: Red Dragon (2002)\nand Hannibal Rising (2007).\n\n## Plot\n\nFBI trainee Clarice Starling is pulled from her training at the FBI Academy at\nQuantico, Virginia by Jack Crawford of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit.\nHe assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and\nincarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in\nthe pursuit of a psychopath serial killer nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\", who kills\nyoung women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Starling travels to\nthe Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by\nFrederick Chilton to Lecter's solitary quarters. Although initially pleasant\nand courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at \"dissecting\"\nhim and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks semen at\nher. Lecter, who considers this act \"unspeakably ugly\", calls Starling back\nand tells her to seek out an old patient of his. This leads her to a storage\nshed, where she discovers a man's severed head with a sphinx moth lodged in\nits throat. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to\nBuffalo Bill. He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he may\nbe transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Buffalo Bill abducts a\nSenator's daughter, Catherine Martin. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer\nLecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information\nthat helps them find Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter\ndemands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues about Buffalo Bill in\nexchange for personal information. Starling tells Lecter about the murder of\nher father when she was ten years old. Chilton secretly records the\nconversation and reveals Starling's deceit before offering Lecter a deal of\nChilton's own making. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he verbally\ntorments Senator Ruth Martin, and gives her misleading information on Buffalo\nBill, including the name \"Louis Friend\". Starling notices that \"Louis Friend\"\nis an anagram of \"iron sulfide\"\u2013fool's gold. She visits Lecter, who is now\nbeing held in a cage-like cell in a Tennessee courthouse, and asks for the\ntruth. Lecter tells her that all the information she needs is contained in the\ncase file. Rather than give her the real name, he insists that they continue\ntheir quid pro quo and she recounts a traumatic childhood incident where she\nwas awakened by the sound of spring lambs being slaughtered on a relative's\nfarm in Montana. Starling admits that she still sometimes wakes thinking she\ncan hear lambs screaming, and Lecter speculates that she is motivated to save\nCatherine in the hope that it will end the nightmares. Lecter gives her back\nthe case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by\nChilton and the police, who escort her from the building. Later that evening,\nLecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears. Starling\nanalyzes Lecter's annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill\nknew his first victim personally. Starling travels to the victim's hometown\nand discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and dress patterns\nidentical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims. She\ntelephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to form a \"woman\nsuit\" out of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest,\nhaving cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding an\nautogynephilic man named Jame Gumb, who once applied unsuccessfully for a sex-\nchange operation, believing himself to be a transgender woman. Starling\ncontinues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio, while\nCrawford leads an FBI HRT team to Gumb's address in Illinois. The house in\nIllinois is empty, and Starling is led to the house of \"Jack Gordon\", whom she\nrealizes is actually Jame Gumb, again by finding a sphinx moth. She pursues\nhim into his multi-room basement, where she discovers that Catherine is still\nalive, but trapped in a dry well. After turning off the basement lights, Gumb\nstalks Starling in the dark with night-vision goggles, but gives his position\naway when he cocks his revolver. Starling reacts just in time and fires all of\nher rounds, killing Gumb. Sometime later, at the FBI Academy graduation party,\nStarling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini. He\nassures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the\nfavor, which she says she cannot do. Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying\nthat he is \"having an old friend for dinner\", and starts following a newly\narrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling\n    * Masha Skorobogatov as young Clarice\n  * Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter\n  * Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford\n  * Ted Levine as Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb\n  * Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton\n  * Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin\n  * Diane Baker as U.S. Senator Ruth Martin\n  * Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp\n  * Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews\n  * Tracey Walter as Lamar\n  * Charles Napier as Lt.

Prior to the novel's release, Orion Pictures\npartnered with Gene Hackman to bring the novel to the big screen. With Hackman\nset to direct and possibly star in the role of Crawford, negotiations were\nmade to split the $500,000 cost of rights between Hackman and the studio. In\naddition to securing the rights to the novel, producers also had to acquire\nthe rights to the name \"Hannibal Lecter\", which were owned by Manhunter\nproducer Dino De Laurentiis. Owing to the financial failure of the earlier\nfilm, De Laurentiis lent the character rights to Orion Pictures for free. In\nNovember 1987, Ted Tally was brought on to write the adaptation; Tally had\npreviously crossed paths with Harris many times, with his interest in adapting\nThe Silence of the Lambs originating from receiving an advance copy of the\nbook from Harris himself. When Tally was about halfway through with the first\ndraft, Hackman withdrew from the project and financing fell through. However,\nOrion Pictures co-founder Mike Medavoy assured Tally to keep writing as the\nstudio itself took care of financing and searched for a replacement director.\nAs a result, Orion Pictures sought director Jonathan Demme to helm the\nproject. With the screenplay not yet completed, Demme signed on after reading\nthe novel. From there, the project quickly took off, as Tally explained,\n\"[Demme] read my first draft not long after it was finished, and we met, then\nI was just startled by the speed of things. We met in May 1989 and were\nshooting in November. I don't remember any big revisions.\"\n\n### Casting\n\nJodie Foster was interested in playing the role of Clarice Starling\nimmediately after reading the novel. However, in spite of the fact that Foster\nhad just won an Academy Award for her performance in the film The Accused\n(1988), Demme was not convinced that she was right for the part. Having just\ncollaborated on Married to the Mob (1988), Demme's first choice for the role\nof Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer, who turned it down, later saying, \"It was a\ndifficult decision, but I got nervous about the subject matter\". Still not\nconvinced, he went to Meg Ryan who rejected it as well for its gruesome themes\nand then to Laura Dern, of whom the studio was skeptical as not being a\nbankable choice. As a result, Foster was awarded the role due to her passion\ntowards the character. For the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Demme originally\napproached Sean Connery. After the actor turned it down, Anthony Hopkins was\nthen offered the part based on his performance in The Elephant Man (1980).\nOther actors considered for the role included Al Pacino, Robert De Niro,\nDustin Hoffman, Derek Jacobi and Daniel Day-Lewis. The mask Hopkins wore\nbecame an iconic symbol for the movie. It was created by Ed Cubberly, of\nFrenchtown, NJ, who had made numerous masks for NHL goalies. Gene Hackman was\noriginally cast to play Jack Crawford, the Agent-in-Charge of the Behavioral\nScience Unit of the FBI in Quantico, Virginia but he found the script \"too\nviolent.\" Scott Glenn was then cast in the role. To prepare for the role,\nGlenn met with John E. Douglas. Douglas gave Glenn a tour of the Quantico\nfacility and also played for him an audio tape containing various recordings\nthat serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves\nraping and torturing a 16-year-old girl. According to Douglas, Glenn wept as\nhe experienced the recordings and even changed his liberal stance on the death\npenalty.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Silence of the Lambs began on November 15, 1989\nand concluded on March 1, 1990. Filming primarily took place in and around\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with some scenes shot in nearby northern West\nVirginia. The home of Buffalo Bill used for exterior scenes was in Layton,\nPennsylvania. The exterior of the Western Center near Canonsburg, Pennsylvania\nserved as the setting for Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.\nIn what was a rare act of cooperation at the time, the FBI allowed scenes to\nbe filmed at the FBI Academy in Quantico; some FBI staff members even acted in\nbit parts.\n\n### Music\n\nThe musical score for The Silence of the Lambs was composed by Howard Shore,\nwho would also go on to collaborate with Demme on Philadelphia.

      "# Sign of the Times (Harry Styles song)\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" is the debut single by English singer-songwriter Harry\nStyles from his self-titled debut studio album. Released on 7 April 2017 by\nColumbia Records, it was written by Styles, Jeff Bhasker, Mitch Rowland, Ryan\nNasci, Alex Salibian, and Tyler Johnson, and produced by Bhasker, Salibian,\nand Johnson. Musically, it was described by critics as a pop rock and soft\nrock ballad. Its accompanying music video was released on 8 May.\n\n## Background and release\n\nRumours about Styles embarking on a solo career sparked in 2015, when it was\nreported that Sony Music wanted Styles to release a solo album during . By the\nend of 2015, four new songs written and performed by Styles were registered on\nthe ASCAP online database, which was believed to be for his potential debut\nsolo album at the time. Shortly after, Styles signed with American agent\nJeffrey Azoff and inked a record contract with Columbia Records. In September\n2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man, which led to media\nspeculation about a new album on the horizon. In February 2017, the CEO of\nColumbia Records, Rob Stringer, revealed that the album was close to being\nfinished and called it \"authentic\". A month later, it was reported that the\nalbum sounded like David Bowie and Queen, and was later revealed to have been\nexecutively produced by Grammy award-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye\nWest, Fun, Mark Ronson). The same report also hinted that the lead single\nwould be released in late April or early May and sounded \"like it would be a\nsmash in any decade\". The same month, US radio host Elvis Duran accidentally\nrevealed during his show that Styles' debut single would be released on 7\nApril 2017. On 25 March, Styles teased the new single with a television ad\nduring The Voice UK. On 31 March, the singer revealed through social media\nthat his single is titled \"Sign of the Times\". On 7 April, the song premiered\nduring Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show on BBC Radio 1.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe song is a pop rock, soft rock, piano ballad, with glam rock influences.\nAccording to Billboard, it \"folds in psychedelic soul, indie rock and spacey\npop\". The \"apocalyptic\" power ballad shows influences from 70s British rock.\nThe track was co-written by Jeff Bhasker, Alex Salibian and Tyler Johnson.\nAlso credited were Mitch Rowland, Ryan Nasci, and Styles (who received the top\ncredit). Rowland played guitar and drums, Nasci the bass, and Bhasker the\npiano, keyboard and lap steel parts. A 25 voice choir provided harmonies\nthroughout the song. The track was recorded at Village Studios in Los Angeles\nand Geejam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and was mixed by\nSpike Stent. \"Sign of the Times\" is composed in the key of F major and set in\na 4/4 time signature at a moderately slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. The\nidea of the song was conceived by Styles while playing chords on the piano in\nJamaica. Styles explained to Rolling Stone that \"The song is written from a\npoint of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there's a\ncomplication. The mother is told, 'The child is fine, but you're not going to\nmake it.' The mother has five minutes to tell the child, 'Go forth and\nconquer.'\" The entire song was cut in three hours according to Bhasker, who\ncalled it \"an instant classic-sounding record from conception to completion\".\n\n## Music video\n\nDirected by Yoann Lemoine, the song's music video was released on 8 May 2017.\nIt features Styles singing in a meadow, flying in the skies, and walking on\nwater.

      "# Sign of the Times (Harry Styles song)\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" is the debut single by English singer-songwriter Harry\nStyles from his self-titled debut studio album. Released on 7 April 2017 by\nColumbia Records, it was written by Styles, Jeff Bhasker, Mitch Rowland, Ryan\nNasci, Alex Salibian, and Tyler Johnson, and produced by Bhasker, Salibian,\nand Johnson. Musically, it was described by critics as a pop rock and soft\nrock ballad. Its accompanying music video was released on 8 May.\n\n## Background and release\n\nRumours about Styles embarking on a solo career sparked in 2015, when it was\nreported that Sony Music wanted Styles to release a solo album during . By the\nend of 2015, four new songs written and performed by Styles were registered on\nthe ASCAP online database, which was believed to be for his potential debut\nsolo album at the time. Shortly after, Styles signed with American agent\nJeffrey Azoff and inked a record contract with Columbia Records. In September\n2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man, which led to media\nspeculation about a new album on the horizon. In February 2017, the CEO of\nColumbia Records, Rob Stringer, revealed that the album was close to being\nfinished and called it \"authentic\". A month later, it was reported that the\nalbum sounded like David Bowie and Queen, and was later revealed to have been\nexecutively produced by Grammy award-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye\nWest, Fun, Mark Ronson). The same report also hinted that the lead single\nwould be released in late April or early May and sounded \"like it would be a\nsmash in any decade\". The same month, US radio host Elvis Duran accidentally\nrevealed during his show that Styles' debut single would be released on 7\nApril 2017. On 25 March, Styles teased the new single with a television ad\nduring The Voice UK. On 31 March, the singer revealed through social media\nthat his single is titled \"Sign of the Times\". On 7 April, the song premiered\nduring Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show on BBC Radio 1.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe song is a pop rock, soft rock, piano ballad, with glam rock influences.\nAccording to Billboard, it \"folds in psychedelic soul, indie rock and spacey\npop\". The \"apocalyptic\" power ballad shows influences from 70s British rock.\nThe track was co-written by Jeff Bhasker, Alex Salibian and Tyler Johnson.\nAlso credited were Mitch Rowland, Ryan Nasci, and Styles (who received the top\ncredit). Rowland played guitar and drums, Nasci the bass, and Bhasker the\npiano, keyboard and lap steel parts. A 25 voice choir provided harmonies\nthroughout the song. The track was recorded at Village Studios in Los Angeles\nand Geejam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and was mixed by\nSpike Stent. \"Sign of the Times\" is composed in the key of F major and set in\na 4/4 time signature at a moderately slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. The\nidea of the song was conceived by Styles while playing chords on the piano in\nJamaica. Styles explained to Rolling Stone that \"The song is written from a\npoint of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there's a\ncomplication. The mother is told, 'The child is fine, but you're not going to\nmake it.' The mother has five minutes to tell the child, 'Go forth and\nconquer.'\" The entire song was cut in three hours according to Bhasker, who\ncalled it \"an instant classic-sounding record from conception to completion\".\n\n## Music video\n\nDirected by Yoann Lemoine, the song's music video was released on 8 May 2017.\nIt features Styles singing in a meadow, flying in the skies, and walking on\nwater.

It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and\n2015, an agreement was made with FIFA, and the award was temporarily merged\nwith the FIFA World Player of the Year and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or.\nHowever, the partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon\nd'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award (now named The\nBest FIFA Men's Player). Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon\nd'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the\nprevious year, based on voting by football journalists, from 1956 to 2006.\nAfter 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right\nto vote. Originally, it was an award for players from Europe. In 1995, the\nBallon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been\nactive at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all\nprofessional footballers from around the world being eligible.\n\n## History\n\nStanley Matthews of Blackpool was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.\nPrior to 1995, the award was often known in English language media as the\nEuropean Footballer of the Year award. Milan's George Weah, the only African\nrecipient, became the first non-European to win the award in the year that\nrules of eligibility were changed. Ronaldo of Internazionale became the first\nSouth American winner two years later. Lionel Messi has won the award a record\nsix times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Three players have won the\naward three times each: Johan Cruyff of Ajax and Barcelona, Michel Platini of\nJuventus, and Marco van Basten of Milan. With seven awards each, Dutch,\nGerman, and Portuguese players have won the most Ballons d'Or. Only Germany\n(1972) and the Netherlands (1988) took all three top spots in one year. Two\nSpanish clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid, share the top for employing the most\nwinners, with eleven wins each.

After 2011, UEFA created\nthe UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the format of the original\nBallon d'Or. Eight players (Bobby Charlton, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd M\u00fcller,\nPaolo Rossi, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, and Kak\u00e1) have won the FIFA\nWorld Cup, the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, and the Ballon d'Or during\ntheir careers. The award shows a bias in favor of attacking players. Over\ntime, the award has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs.

      "# The 100 (TV series)\n\nThe 100 (pronounced The Hundred) is an American post-apocalyptic science\nfiction drama television series that premiered on March 19, 2014, on The CW.\nThe series, developed by Jason Rothenberg, is loosely based on the novel\nseries of the same name by Kass Morgan. The series follows a group of post-\napocalyptic survivors, chiefly a group of criminal adolescents, including\nClarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake\n(Bob Morley), Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon\nBostick), Monty Green (Christopher Larkin), Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), John\nMurphy (Richard Harmon), and Wells Jaha (Eli Goree). They are among the first\npeople from a space habitat, the Ark, to return to Earth after a devastating\nnuclear apocalypse. Other lead characters include Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige\nTurco), Clarke's mother; Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a council member on\nthe Ark; and Thelonious Jaha (Isaiah Washington), the Chancellor of the Ark\nand Wells's father. In April 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh\nseason, which will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced\nthat the series will conclude with the seventh season.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe setting is 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out\nalmost all life on Earth. Thousands of people live in a space station orbiting\nEarth, which they call the Ark, constructed of connecting space stations and\nspacecraft. Three generations have been born in space, bringing the population\nof the Ark beyond carrying capacity. The future is jeopardized by over-\npopulation. 100 juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to\ndetermine whether it is habitable. They discover that some survived the\napocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the\nReapers, another group of Grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the\nMountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from\nthose who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership\nof Bellamy and Clarke, the 100 attempt to survive the harsh surface\nconditions, battle hostile Grounders and establish communication with the Ark.\nIn the second season, 48 of the remaining 100 are captured and taken to Mount\nWeather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men\nare transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment\nas their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on\nEarth. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation\nefficacy: their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside\ncontainment. The inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on\nEarth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people,\nnaming the main settlement at Alpha Station \"Camp Jaha\". In the third season,\nAlpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former\nteacher, and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with\nthe Grounders. Pike uses very dangerous methods, which further damages their\nalready fragile relationship with the grounders. An artificial intelligence\nnamed A.L.I.E. who was commanded to make life better for mankind is revealed\nto have responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching\nthe nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of\nnearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In\nthe season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E. In the fourth\nseason, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to\ndecades of neglect that will result in 96 percent of the planet becoming\nuninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming\nwave of radiation. When it is discovered that the Grounders with black blood,\nknown as the Nightbloods \u2013 can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others\nattempt to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is\ndiscovered that can protect 1,200 people for over 5 years from the new\napocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the\nbunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the\nremnants of the Ark. However, Clarke, who is now a nightblood remained on the\nEarth's surface alone. In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of\nthe nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot\nleft on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood Grounder who also survived\nthe wave of radiation that swept the planet after the meltdown, have been\nliving. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on\nthe ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley between the prisoners and a new,\nunited clan, known as Wonkru, begins, resulting in a battle ending with the\nvalley being destroyed. The survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep\nwhile they wait for the Earth to recover. In the sixth season, after 125 years\nin cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they\nare no longer orbiting Earth and have been brought to a new habitable world,\nAlpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new\nsociety, led by ruling families known as the Primes. However, they also\ndiscover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as\nthe Children of Gabriel.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n  * Eliza Taylor as Clarke Griffin\n  * Paige Turco as Abigail \"Abby\" Griffin (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Thomas McDonell as Finn Collins (seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Eli Goree as Wells Jaha (season 1; guest season 2)\n  * Marie Avgeropoulos as Octavia Blake\n  * Bob Morley as Bellamy Blake\n  * Kelly Hu as Callie \"Cece\" Cartwig (season 1)\n  * Christopher Larkin as Monty Green (seasons 1\u20135; guest season 6)\n  * Devon Bostick as Jasper Jordan (seasons 1\u20134)\n  * Isaiah Washington as Thelonious Jaha (seasons 1\u20135)\n  * Henry Ian Cusick as Marcus Kane (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Lindsey Morgan as Raven Reyes (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1)\n  * Ricky Whittle as Lincoln (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n  * Richard Harmon as John Murphy (season 3\u2013present; recurring seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Zach McGowan as Roan (season 4; recurring season 3)\n  * Tasya Teles as Echo (season 5\u2013present; recurring season 4; guest seasons 2\u20133)\n  * Shannon Kook as Jordan Green (season 6\u2013present; guest season 5)\n\n### Notes\n\n## Episodes\n\nThe 100 premiered on March 19, 2014. On May 8, 2014, The CW renewed The 100\nfor a second season, which premiered on October 22, 2014. On January 11, 2015,\nThe CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on January 21,\n2016. On March 12, 2016, The 100 was renewed for a fourth season of 13\nepisodes, which premiered on February 1, 2017. On March 10, 2017, The CW\nrenewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on April 24, 2018. On\nMay 9, 2018, the series was renewed for a sixth season, which premiered on\nApril 30, 2019. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a seventh\nseason, that will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced the\nseventh season will be the final season, finishing the show with a total of\n100 episodes across all seven seasons.\n\n## Production\n\nPost production, including ADR recording for the series, was done at the\nrecording studio Cherry Beach Sound. David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki\nand Valyrian for Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for The\nGrounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole English. The\nlanguage is called \"Trig\" on the show. After his constructed language work on\nStar-Crossed, Peterson was contacted by the producers of The 100 to create a\nlanguage for the Grounders, an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years\nhave passed since the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant\nlanguage change. Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in\nwhich the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their speech\nand to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives from that\ncant and evolved over several short generations of survivors of the\napocalypse.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia.\nProduction on the pilot occurred during the second quarter of 2013. After the\nshow was picked up to series, filming occurred for the first season between\nAugust 2013 and January 2014.

Filming for the fourth season\ncommenced on August 2, 2016, and concluded on January 18, 2017. Filming for\nthe fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January 27,\n2018.\n\n### Casting\n\nIn late February 2013, Bob Morley and Eli Goree were cast as Bellamy Blake and\nWells Jaha, respectively, followed a day later by the casting of Henry Ian\nCusick as Marcus Kane. Less than a week later, Eliza Taylor and Marie\nAvgeropoulos were cast in co-starring roles as Clarke Griffin and Octavia\nBlake, respectively.

Its first season has a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with\nan average score of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Although flooded\nwith stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make The 100 a rare high-\nconcept guilty pleasure\". On Metacritic, the first season scores 63 out of 100\npoints, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The\nsecond season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100% on\nRotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 8.08/10. On Metacritic, the season is\nassigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 2 critics. In a review of the\nseason 2 finale, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club said, \"Very few shows manage to\nreally push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels\nlegitimately difficult. Breaking Bad did it. The Sopranos did it. Game of\nThrones has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical\nmurkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, happy ending if it\ndoesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' The 100 has done\nthe same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex\nstakes it's spent a whole season building up\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington\nPost, in another positive review, wrote: \"I can say with some assurance that\nI've rarely seen a program demonstrate the kind of consistency and thematic\ndedication that The 100 has shown in its first two seasons. This is a show\nabout moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been\nlaudably committed to those ideas from Day 1\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the third\nseason received an overall rating of 83% with an average rating of 8.01/10.\nThe Critical consensus is, \"The 100 goes macro in season 3, skillfully\nexpanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape\". On\nMetacritic, the season is assigned a score of 77 out of 100, based on 3\ncritics, indicating generally positive reviews. Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote\nin an early review of the third season: \"When looking at the epic feel and\nvaried array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly\nrecalls \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to\nrecall how limited the scope and the ambitions of \"The 100\" were two years\nago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season\nthree (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more\npolitically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the\ndepiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally\nadmirable\". In a review of the season 3 finale \"Perverse Instantiation: Part\nTwo\", Mariya Karimjee of Vulture.com wrote: \"Every moment of this finale is\npitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing,\nand the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. \"Perverse\nInstantiation: Part Two\" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its\ndisparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four\". In another\nreview of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of The A.V.\nClub wrote: \"Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100,\nit needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it\nwas defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second\nhalf of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink,\nfocusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral\nchoices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays\noff with \"Perverse Instantiation: Part Two,\" a thrilling, forward-thinking\nfinale that provides some necessary closure to this season\". He gave the\nfinale itself an \"A-\" rating. The fourth season is generally considered to be\nan improvement over the third season, receiving a 93% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus\nis, \"Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their\nfavorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their\nthrilling circumstances\". On Metacritic, the season is assigned a score of 80\nout of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating generally positive reviews. The\nsecond portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the\nfirst portion, with the episodes Die All, Die Merrily and Praimfaya often\ncited as the two best episodes of the season. Die All, Die Merrily has a\n9.5/10 rating from IGN, a perfect 5/5 rating from Vulture and a perfect A\nrating from The AV Club. Praimfaya has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from\nThe AV Club. The fifth season currently has a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average of 8.8/10. The critical consensus is, \"Five years in, The 100\nmanages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season.\" This is\nthe highest rating any season of the show has received to date. On Metacritic,\nthe season is assigned a score of 80 out of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating\ngenerally positive reviews. All episodes of the season received highly\npositive reviews, but the third episode Sleeping Giants has received\nparticular high acclaim. In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the episode is\ndescribed as being a \"good ol' fashioned episode of The 100\", praising its\nbalance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The episode also gained a\n4.5/5 rating from TVOverMind, praising the \"pulse-pounding action\" and\napproach to problem solving. Brian Lowry of The Boston Globe said: \"Our\nattraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different\nfuturistic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it\na reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes\". Allison\nKeene of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating: \"The sci-fi\ndrama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only\nby attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space\". Kelly West of\nCinema Blend gave it a more positive review while noting: \"CW's Thrilling New\nSci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more\nwith a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and\nthriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when The 100\nbegins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge\".\nIGN's editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing:\n\"Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, The 100 was a very\nstrong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series\ninto the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring\nseries on TV these days\". Maureen Ryan of Variety named the show one of the\nbest of 2015. In 2016, the year Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list\nof the \"40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time\", the episode \"Thirteen\"\nattracted criticism when Lexa, one of the series' LGBT characters, was killed\noff. Critics and fans considered the death a continuation of a persistent\ntrope in television in which LGBT characters are killed off far more often\nthan others \u2013 implicitly portraying them as disposable, as existing only to\nserve the stories of straight characters, or to attract viewers. A widespread\ndebate among writers and fans about the trope ensued, with Lexa's death cited\nas a prime example of the trope, and why it should end. Showrunner Jason\nRothenberg eventually wrote in response that \"I (...) write and produce\ntelevision for the real world where negative and hurtful tropes exist. And I\nam very sorry for not recognizing this as fully as I should have\".\n\n### Ratings\n\nAn estimated 2.7million American viewers watched the series premiere, which\nreceived an 18\u201349 rating of 0.9, making it the most-watched show in its time\nslot on The CW since 2010, with the series Life Unexpected.\n\n### Accolades\n\n## Prequel series\n\nIn October 2019, it was confirmed Rothenberg was developing a The 100 prequel\nseries for The CW. It was reported that a backdoor pilot episode had been\nordered, which will air as an episode of the seventh and final season of The\n100. The prequel series is set to show the events 97 years before the original\nseries, beginning with the nuclear apocalypse that wiped out almost all life\non Earth.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# The Surplus\n\n\"The Surplus\" is the tenth episode of the fifth season of the television\nseries The Office, and the show's eighty-second episode overall. The episode\naired in the United States on December 4, 2008 on NBC. In this episode, the\noffice is at odds over whether to spend a budget surplus on new chairs or a\nnew photocopier, with Jim, Pam, and Oscar in particular trying to convince\nMichael how to spend the money. Meanwhile, Andy and Angela visit Schrute Farms\nto discuss their wedding plans.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nOscar (Oscar Nunez) informs Michael (Steve Carell) that the office must spend\na $4300 surplus or lose it in next year's budget. When Michael opens up the\nfloor for suggestions, factions break out and officemates square off against\none another in order to get what they want. Oscar suggests that they replace\nthe copier while Pam (Jenna Fischer) suggests they buy new chairs and Toby\n(Paul Lieberstein) suggests that they get the air quality in the office tested\nsaying that there is radon coming from downstairs and asbestos coming from the\nceiling. Jim (John Krasinski) takes Oscar's side, much to Pam's shock, because\nhe started making copies himself since he and Pam started dating (asking Pam\nto make copies makes him feel awkward) and knows how bad the copier is, while\nthe rest of the employees side with Pam. Pam notices the copier malfunctioning\nwhen she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs. Michael does not\nchoose a side, because he does not want to be the bad guy, so both sides start\nwarming up to him to win him over. Jim and Oscar take Michael out for lunch,\nwhile Pam puts on more make-up and starts to hit on Michael. Meanwhile, Angela\n(Angela Kinsey) and Andy (Ed Helms) visit Schrute Farms to discuss wedding\nplans with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with\nDwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela's father. An Amish minister who\nonly speaks German plays the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight\ngoes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on\nAngela's finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears\nto be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting\ntogether with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the\nmock wedding was an actual wedding since Andy technically acted as their\nwitness and the supposedly fake minister was actually marrying them in German.\nHe tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on\nhis farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately\nkisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to\ntake care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).\nMichael still remains indecisive regarding what to buy, so he brings in a\nthird party: Hank (Hugh Dane) the security guard. However, Hank is more\ninterested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael\ncalls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that\nhe has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting\npaid a bonus equal to 15% of it. Michael then tells the employees that he is\nnot going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar realizes that\nMichael now knows about the 3rd option (Michael immediately says \"645 dollars\"\nwhen Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is but struggles to calculate 15% of\n200). Michael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees'\nintrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that\nthey will be unable to come to a consensus by the day's end and enable him to\ntake the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced\ninstead of remaining deadlocked, which upsets Michael. Later Michael is shown\nwearing a fur coat he had bought in anticipation of receiving the bonus, which\nhad fake blood thrown on it by activists. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try\nto get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, telling him that he\nis on \"dangerous ground\". Pam is nasty towards Jim during the entire debate,\nwhich Jim seems more easygoing about. However, at the end of the episode, Jim\ngets back at Pam for winning the debate by reverting to his earlier practice\nof having Pam make copies for him.\n\n## Reception\n\n\"The Surplus\" was voted the eighth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the\nfifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the\nepisode was rated 8.42 out of 10.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * This episode begins Ryan Howard's 11-episode absence from the office, as he went on vacation. He would return in \"Dream Team\".\n  * According to the commentary on this episode, B. J. Novak says that he was going to co-star in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds which is why his character is going to Thailand.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Surplus\" at NBC.com\n\n",

      "# Kate Barry\n\nCatharine Moore Barry ( October 1752\u2013 September 1823) was a heroine of the\nAmerican Revolutionary War. She was the daughter of Charles and Mary Moore,\nand the eldest of ten children. She married Andrew Barry in 1767 at the age of\n15 and lived on Walnut Grove Plantation in Roebuck, South Carolina during the\n18th century. She was instrumental in helping to warn the militia of the\ncoming British before the Battle of Cowpens in 1781. According to legend, she\ntied her toddler to the bedpost while she rode out to warn neighbors that the\nBritish were coming. Her warning helped to prepare the colonial forces to\ndefeat the British governor, Cornwallis and his men and drive them north, out\nof the state of South Carolina. She is buried in the family cemetery in Moore,\nSouth Carolina, beside her husband, Andrew, who was one of the first elders of\nthe Nazareth Presbyterian Church. She knew the Indian trails and shortcuts\nwhere almost no patriots lived. Barry was a spy and message bearer for the\nmilitia when the Battle of Cowpens was fought on January 17, 1781. The Battle\nof Cowpens (January 17, 1781) was a decisive victory by Continental army\nforces under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, in the Southern campaign of the\nAmerican Revolutionary War. It was a turning point in the reconquest of South\nCarolina from the British. Kate Barry was an ancestor of the actress Amanda\nBlake (1929-1989), remembered for the role of the red-haired saloon\nproprietress \"Miss Kitty Russell\" on the television western Gunsmoke. Blake\nplaced a cameo-sized portrait of Barry owned by her family in the Spartanburg,\nSouth Carolina local history museum, where it remains on display to this day.\n\n## References\n\n  * Silcox-Garrett, Diane.

      "# The 100 (TV series)\n\nThe 100 (pronounced The Hundred) is an American post-apocalyptic science\nfiction drama television series that premiered on March 19, 2014, on The CW.\nThe series, developed by Jason Rothenberg, is loosely based on the novel\nseries of the same name by Kass Morgan. The series follows a group of post-\napocalyptic survivors, chiefly a group of criminal adolescents, including\nClarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake\n(Bob Morley), Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon\nBostick), Monty Green (Christopher Larkin), Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), John\nMurphy (Richard Harmon), and Wells Jaha (Eli Goree). They are among the first\npeople from a space habitat, the Ark, to return to Earth after a devastating\nnuclear apocalypse. Other lead characters include Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige\nTurco), Clarke's mother; Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a council member on\nthe Ark; and Thelonious Jaha (Isaiah Washington), the Chancellor of the Ark\nand Wells's father. In April 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh\nseason, which will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced\nthat the series will conclude with the seventh season.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe setting is 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out\nalmost all life on Earth. Thousands of people live in a space station orbiting\nEarth, which they call the Ark, constructed of connecting space stations and\nspacecraft. Three generations have been born in space, bringing the population\nof the Ark beyond carrying capacity. The future is jeopardized by over-\npopulation. 100 juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to\ndetermine whether it is habitable. They discover that some survived the\napocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the\nReapers, another group of Grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the\nMountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from\nthose who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership\nof Bellamy and Clarke, the 100 attempt to survive the harsh surface\nconditions, battle hostile Grounders and establish communication with the Ark.\nIn the second season, 48 of the remaining 100 are captured and taken to Mount\nWeather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men\nare transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment\nas their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on\nEarth. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation\nefficacy: their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside\ncontainment. The inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on\nEarth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people,\nnaming the main settlement at Alpha Station \"Camp Jaha\". In the third season,\nAlpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former\nteacher, and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with\nthe Grounders. Pike uses very dangerous methods, which further damages their\nalready fragile relationship with the grounders. An artificial intelligence\nnamed A.L.I.E. who was commanded to make life better for mankind is revealed\nto have responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching\nthe nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of\nnearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In\nthe season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E. In the fourth\nseason, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to\ndecades of neglect that will result in 96 percent of the planet becoming\nuninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming\nwave of radiation. When it is discovered that the Grounders with black blood,\nknown as the Nightbloods \u2013 can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others\nattempt to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is\ndiscovered that can protect 1,200 people for over 5 years from the new\napocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the\nbunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the\nremnants of the Ark. However, Clarke, who is now a nightblood remained on the\nEarth's surface alone. In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of\nthe nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot\nleft on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood Grounder who also survived\nthe wave of radiation that swept the planet after the meltdown, have been\nliving. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on\nthe ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley between the prisoners and a new,\nunited clan, known as Wonkru, begins, resulting in a battle ending with the\nvalley being destroyed. The survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep\nwhile they wait for the Earth to recover. In the sixth season, after 125 years\nin cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they\nare no longer orbiting Earth and have been brought to a new habitable world,\nAlpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new\nsociety, led by ruling families known as the Primes. However, they also\ndiscover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as\nthe Children of Gabriel.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n  * Eliza Taylor as Clarke Griffin\n  * Paige Turco as Abigail \"Abby\" Griffin (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Thomas McDonell as Finn Collins (seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Eli Goree as Wells Jaha (season 1; guest season 2)\n  * Marie Avgeropoulos as Octavia Blake\n  * Bob Morley as Bellamy Blake\n  * Kelly Hu as Callie \"Cece\" Cartwig (season 1)\n  * Christopher Larkin as Monty Green (seasons 1\u20135; guest season 6)\n  * Devon Bostick as Jasper Jordan (seasons 1\u20134)\n  * Isaiah Washington as Thelonious Jaha (seasons 1\u20135)\n  * Henry Ian Cusick as Marcus Kane (seasons 1\u20136)\n  * Lindsey Morgan as Raven Reyes (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1)\n  * Ricky Whittle as Lincoln (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n  * Richard Harmon as John Murphy (season 3\u2013present; recurring seasons 1\u20132)\n  * Zach McGowan as Roan (season 4; recurring season 3)\n  * Tasya Teles as Echo (season 5\u2013present; recurring season 4; guest seasons 2\u20133)\n  * Shannon Kook as Jordan Green (season 6\u2013present; guest season 5)\n\n### Notes\n\n## Episodes\n\nThe 100 premiered on March 19, 2014. On May 8, 2014, The CW renewed The 100\nfor a second season, which premiered on October 22, 2014. On January 11, 2015,\nThe CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on January 21,\n2016. On March 12, 2016, The 100 was renewed for a fourth season of 13\nepisodes, which premiered on February 1, 2017. On March 10, 2017, The CW\nrenewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on April 24, 2018. On\nMay 9, 2018, the series was renewed for a sixth season, which premiered on\nApril 30, 2019. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a seventh\nseason, that will consist of 16 episodes. In August 2019, it was announced the\nseventh season will be the final season, finishing the show with a total of\n100 episodes across all seven seasons.\n\n## Production\n\nPost production, including ADR recording for the series, was done at the\nrecording studio Cherry Beach Sound. David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki\nand Valyrian for Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for The\nGrounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole English. The\nlanguage is called \"Trig\" on the show. After his constructed language work on\nStar-Crossed, Peterson was contacted by the producers of The 100 to create a\nlanguage for the Grounders, an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years\nhave passed since the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant\nlanguage change. Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in\nwhich the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their speech\nand to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives from that\ncant and evolved over several short generations of survivors of the\napocalypse.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia.\nProduction on the pilot occurred during the second quarter of 2013. After the\nshow was picked up to series, filming occurred for the first season between\nAugust 2013 and January 2014.

Filming for the fourth season\ncommenced on August 2, 2016, and concluded on January 18, 2017. Filming for\nthe fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January 27,\n2018.\n\n### Casting\n\nIn late February 2013, Bob Morley and Eli Goree were cast as Bellamy Blake and\nWells Jaha, respectively, followed a day later by the casting of Henry Ian\nCusick as Marcus Kane. Less than a week later, Eliza Taylor and Marie\nAvgeropoulos were cast in co-starring roles as Clarke Griffin and Octavia\nBlake, respectively. Throughout March, the rest of the cast was filled out,\nwith Paige Turco cast as Abigail Walters (now Abigail Griffin), Isaiah\nWashington as Chancellor Jaha, Thomas McDonnell as Finn Collins, Kelly Hu as\nCallie Cartwig, and Christopher Larkin as Monty Green.

Its first season has a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with\nan average score of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Although flooded\nwith stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make The 100 a rare high-\nconcept guilty pleasure\". On Metacritic, the first season scores 63 out of 100\npoints, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The\nsecond season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100% on\nRotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 8.08/10. On Metacritic, the season is\nassigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 2 critics. In a review of the\nseason 2 finale, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club said, \"Very few shows manage to\nreally push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels\nlegitimately difficult. Breaking Bad did it. The Sopranos did it. Game of\nThrones has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical\nmurkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, happy ending if it\ndoesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' The 100 has done\nthe same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex\nstakes it's spent a whole season building up\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington\nPost, in another positive review, wrote: \"I can say with some assurance that\nI've rarely seen a program demonstrate the kind of consistency and thematic\ndedication that The 100 has shown in its first two seasons. This is a show\nabout moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been\nlaudably committed to those ideas from Day 1\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the third\nseason received an overall rating of 83% with an average rating of 8.01/10.\nThe Critical consensus is, \"The 100 goes macro in season 3, skillfully\nexpanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape\". On\nMetacritic, the season is assigned a score of 77 out of 100, based on 3\ncritics, indicating generally positive reviews. Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote\nin an early review of the third season: \"When looking at the epic feel and\nvaried array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly\nrecalls \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to\nrecall how limited the scope and the ambitions of \"The 100\" were two years\nago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season\nthree (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more\npolitically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the\ndepiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally\nadmirable\". In a review of the season 3 finale \"Perverse Instantiation: Part\nTwo\", Mariya Karimjee of Vulture.com wrote: \"Every moment of this finale is\npitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing,\nand the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. \"Perverse\nInstantiation: Part Two\" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its\ndisparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four\". In another\nreview of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of The A.V.\nClub wrote: \"Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100,\nit needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it\nwas defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second\nhalf of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink,\nfocusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral\nchoices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays\noff with \"Perverse Instantiation: Part Two,\" a thrilling, forward-thinking\nfinale that provides some necessary closure to this season\". He gave the\nfinale itself an \"A-\" rating. The fourth season is generally considered to be\nan improvement over the third season, receiving a 93% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus\nis, \"Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their\nfavorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their\nthrilling circumstances\". On Metacritic, the season is assigned a score of 80\nout of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating generally positive reviews. The\nsecond portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the\nfirst portion, with the episodes Die All, Die Merrily and Praimfaya often\ncited as the two best episodes of the season. Die All, Die Merrily has a\n9.5/10 rating from IGN, a perfect 5/5 rating from Vulture and a perfect A\nrating from The AV Club. Praimfaya has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from\nThe AV Club. The fifth season currently has a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes\nwith an average of 8.8/10. The critical consensus is, \"Five years in, The 100\nmanages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season.\" This is\nthe highest rating any season of the show has received to date. On Metacritic,\nthe season is assigned a score of 80 out of 100, based on 1 critic, indicating\ngenerally positive reviews. All episodes of the season received highly\npositive reviews, but the third episode Sleeping Giants has received\nparticular high acclaim. In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the episode is\ndescribed as being a \"good ol' fashioned episode of The 100\", praising its\nbalance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The episode also gained a\n4.5/5 rating from TVOverMind, praising the \"pulse-pounding action\" and\napproach to problem solving. Brian Lowry of The Boston Globe said: \"Our\nattraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different\nfuturistic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it\na reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes\". Allison\nKeene of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating: \"The sci-fi\ndrama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only\nby attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space\". Kelly West of\nCinema Blend gave it a more positive review while noting: \"CW's Thrilling New\nSci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more\nwith a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and\nthriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when The 100\nbegins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge\".\nIGN's editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing:\n\"Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, The 100 was a very\nstrong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series\ninto the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring\nseries on TV these days\". Maureen Ryan of Variety named the show one of the\nbest of 2015. In 2016, the year Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list\nof the \"40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time\", the episode \"Thirteen\"\nattracted criticism when Lexa, one of the series' LGBT characters, was killed\noff. Critics and fans considered the death a continuation of a persistent\ntrope in television in which LGBT characters are killed off far more often\nthan others \u2013 implicitly portraying them as disposable, as existing only to\nserve the stories of straight characters, or to attract viewers. A widespread\ndebate among writers and fans about the trope ensued, with Lexa's death cited\nas a prime example of the trope, and why it should end. Showrunner Jason\nRothenberg eventually wrote in response that \"I (...) write and produce\ntelevision for the real world where negative and hurtful tropes exist. And I\nam very sorry for not recognizing this as fully as I should have\".\n\n### Ratings\n\nAn estimated 2.7million American viewers watched the series premiere, which\nreceived an 18\u201349 rating of 0.9, making it the most-watched show in its time\nslot on The CW since 2010, with the series Life Unexpected.\n\n### Accolades\n\n## Prequel series\n\nIn October 2019, it was confirmed Rothenberg was developing a The 100 prequel\nseries for The CW. It was reported that a backdoor pilot episode had been\nordered, which will air as an episode of the seventh and final season of The\n100. The prequel series is set to show the events 97 years before the original\nseries, beginning with the nuclear apocalypse that wiped out almost all life\non Earth.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

I have a lot of memories of wounds\nI have received from others, but I have no memories of the wounds I have given\nto others. In short, the demand and supply of \"shuttle\" do not match. Maybe\nit's caused by more unintended injuries. Maybe there are people who hurt\nothers in their own existence. Maybe the memory of the wound I got was a self-\ninflicted scratch.

      "# Last Man Standing (Australian TV series)\n\nLast Man Standing is an Australian television series which aired in Australia\nfrom June 2005 to October 2005 on Seven Network; and in New Zealand from April\nto September 2005. It was aired also in Finland (Viimeiseen mieheen) in 2007.\nThe series did not return for a second season.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe main characters are three best friends \u2014 Adam, Bruno and Cameron \u2014 who\nlive and work in Melbourne. Adam is newly single, having come out of a long-\nterm relationship, and is dealing with the dating world for the first time in\na long time. Cameron is the sexual predator of the group, although this role\nhas been somewhat lessened by the fact that his ex-wife Zoe \u2014 who left when he\nhad an affair \u2014 is now part of the group, and is becoming friends with the\nwomen he dates. Bruno is a nurse who has a habit of falling for women who\ndon't care for him, while ignoring the many women who do. All three are\ndiscovering that, in their late twenties, they are still single and really\nhave no idea about women whatsoever. In keeping with the show's distinctly\nMelbourne feel, iconic Melbourne rock band Dallas Crane recorded a cover of\nCome See Me, originally by The Pretty Things, for the show's theme tune. The\ncover can be found as a B-side to the band's Curiosity single\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main\n\n  * Rodger Corser as Adam Logan\n  * Travis McMahon as Bruno Palmer\n  * Matt Passmore as Cameron Kennedy\n  * Miriama Smith as Zoe Hesketh\n\n### Recurring\n\n  * Fletcher Humphrys as Anto\n  * Anita Hegh as Marly\n  * Jesse Griffin as Chich\n  * Nikola Dubois as Taia\n  * Jacinta Stapleton as Syl\n  * Stephen Phillips as Mark\n  * Gillian Hardy as Anne\n  * Terry Kenwrick as Gavin\n  * Kat Stewart as Claire\n  * Cal Wilson as Nurse Jude Vanderwert\n  * Susan Godfrey as Nurse Rachel Barton\n\n## Broadcast history\n\nThe series premiered in Australia on 6 June 2005 - although it premiered in\nNew Zealand some two months earlier. It struggled to find an audience from the\nbeginning, with an average Australian viewership of 750,000 weekly viewers.\nThese low ratings occurred despite the show having Desperate Housewives as a\nlead in, which at the time was attracting over 2 million viewers a week. It\nwas thought by critics that Last Man Standing appealed only to \"inner city\nlefties\", unlike past successful Australian dramas such as Blue Heelers and\nAll Saints which have more widespread demographic appeal. Given that a full 22\nepisodes had been filmed before the series began airing, the Seven Network\naired consistent repeats to allow the show to find an audience. Ratings didn't\nclimb, however, and in early September, the network announced the show's\ncancellation. The series finale aired on 25 October. This episode ended in a\ncliffhanger, which - due to the show's cancellation - will remain unresolved.\nThe series began its airing in the UK on the FX channel in early 2006. The\nseries began its airing in Finland on the Sub (formerly known as Subtv)\nchannel in June 2007.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of Australian television series\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Last Man Standing at the National Film and Sound Archive\n  * Last Man Standing on 7plus\n\n",

    "question": "When was the new international version bible's first major revision released?",
    "gold_doc": [
      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition.

      "# FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs\nbetween different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined. Donahue was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the\n\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\" category in 2014 for his work at KSAN and\nKMPX.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * jive95.com Web site honoring KSAN-FM in its glory days\n\n",

Data include interval\nmeasures of highest and lowest elevation for all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and territories. Which state or territory is \"highest\" and \"lowest\"\nis determined by the definition of \"high\" and \"low\". For instance, Alaska\ncould be regarded as the highest state because Denali, at , is the highest\npoint in the United States. However, Colorado, with the highest mean elevation\nof any state as well as the highest low point, could also be considered a\ncandidate for \"highest state\". Determining which state is \"lowest\" is equally\nproblematic.

In Europe, Australia and Africa\n((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans\nfrom 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the\nAmericas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in\nJapan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation\n(OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these\ncountries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of\nRussia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have\nchanged to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in\nthe United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not\nbecome widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated\nradio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this\narticle are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to\n300 MHz.\n\n## CCIR bandplan\n\n### Center frequencies\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,\n0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz\nchannel spacings throughout Europe.\n\n  * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.\n  * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.\n  * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.\n  * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity.\n\n### ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong\nused the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was\nchanged to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States,\nMexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center\nfrequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers\nare rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The\ncenter frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The\nfrequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz),\nis used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio\ntuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and\nsold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7\nMHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (\u00b110 kHz) could be received,\nsuch as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of\ndigital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant\nwhen the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down\nor convert to digital by September 2015\u2014but there are still analog television\nstations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also\nanalog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of\n87.9\u201391.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band,\nexclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels\n(92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221\u2013300) may be used by both commercial\nand non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this\nreservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be\nassigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one\ngeographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7,\netc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7\netc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM\nbroadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated\npower (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300\nfeet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were\n92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9,\n101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other\nfrequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW,\n2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC\nswitched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently\noperating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and\nchange antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six\nkilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late\n2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and\nclass conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-\nadjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\n### Deviation and bandpass\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and\nsubcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150\nkHz total (\u00b175 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the\nband. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-\nstereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by\nthe subcarriers.\n\n## OIRT bandplan\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries\nof the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe\n(OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100\n(later 104) MHz broadcast band\u2014in line with Western Europe. The lower portion\nof the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer\nreach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for\nreaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception.\nIn a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate\ninterference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as\nearly as in eighties in some East European countries. Following the collapse\nof the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as\nprivate stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of\nequipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission\nnetworks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM\nband, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the\nUSSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the\nlack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries\nwhich still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the\n87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning\nof the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally\ncoordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in\nthe VHF band in Geneva, 1984 . Allocated frequencies are still valid and are\nused in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into\noperation at 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984, and nine primary\ntransmitters were built during next three years along country; 270\ntransmitters from 45 locations should be the final number . The transition was\nfinished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in\n2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur\nradio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform\npropagation and interference experiments in the 70\u201370.5 MHz band. In Belarus,\nonly government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All\nstations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main\npurpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014,\nRussia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the\n\"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to\nreach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based\non 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to\nreduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other\natmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However,\nmultipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo\nis generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process\ncalled polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25\nkHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal\nstructure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band\n(70\u201370.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is\nentirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band\n(50\u201354 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there\nis an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing\nbecause the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single\nbroadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the\nband. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within\nthe 87.5\u2013108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D\ntherefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to\nmake full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\n## Japanese bandplan\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76\u201395 MHz (previously 76\u201390). The 90\u2013108 MHz section\nwas used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel\nwas 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to\nslightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations\nthat can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial\nradio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of\nreceiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same\nmodel can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz,\nthe frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the\nradio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode\nor other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios\nwere formerly marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 76\u201388 section. If these radios\nwere sold in the US, for example, the 76\u201388 section would be marked TV sound\nfor VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88\u2013108\nsection band as normal FM. The compatibility of \"TV sound\" with conventional\nFM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception\nof the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use\nanalog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand\nautomobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM\nband, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9\nMHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing\nan incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in\nundesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular\ninternational FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese\nband (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert\nmodes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some\nconverters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical\nfrequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the\n102\u2013108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car\nradios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow\npass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better\nsolution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the\ncountry where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with\nAustralian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was\nintending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due\nto CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in\nAustralia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\n## Historic U.S. bandplan\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42\u201350 MHz band\n(this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations\nknown as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already\nusing FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band\nfrom a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in\nthe northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United\nStates FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88\u2013106 MHz band (later\nextended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although\nconverters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to\nrebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set\nFM radio back ten years. The \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for\n(with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant,\nalthough the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted\n\"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other\nnetworks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television,\nwhich RCA wanted to focus on. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment\non turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5\nand 6 (76\u201388 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital\ntelevision transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed\nto June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies\ncorresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76\nMHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\n## FM radio switch-off\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM\nradio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to\ndiscontinue FM as a result.\n\n## See also\n\n  * FM broadcasting\n  * Frequency modulation\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# The Surplus\n\n\"The Surplus\" is the tenth episode of the fifth season of the television\nseries The Office, and the show's eighty-second episode overall. The episode\naired in the United States on December 4, 2008 on NBC. In this episode, the\noffice is at odds over whether to spend a budget surplus on new chairs or a\nnew photocopier, with Jim, Pam, and Oscar in particular trying to convince\nMichael how to spend the money. Meanwhile, Andy and Angela visit Schrute Farms\nto discuss their wedding plans.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nOscar (Oscar Nunez) informs Michael (Steve Carell) that the office must spend\na $4300 surplus or lose it in next year's budget. When Michael opens up the\nfloor for suggestions, factions break out and officemates square off against\none another in order to get what they want. Oscar suggests that they replace\nthe copier while Pam (Jenna Fischer) suggests they buy new chairs and Toby\n(Paul Lieberstein) suggests that they get the air quality in the office tested\nsaying that there is radon coming from downstairs and asbestos coming from the\nceiling. Jim (John Krasinski) takes Oscar's side, much to Pam's shock, because\nhe started making copies himself since he and Pam started dating (asking Pam\nto make copies makes him feel awkward) and knows how bad the copier is, while\nthe rest of the employees side with Pam. Pam notices the copier malfunctioning\nwhen she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs. Michael does not\nchoose a side, because he does not want to be the bad guy, so both sides start\nwarming up to him to win him over. Jim and Oscar take Michael out for lunch,\nwhile Pam puts on more make-up and starts to hit on Michael. Meanwhile, Angela\n(Angela Kinsey) and Andy (Ed Helms) visit Schrute Farms to discuss wedding\nplans with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with\nDwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela's father. An Amish minister who\nonly speaks German plays the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight\ngoes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on\nAngela's finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears\nto be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting\ntogether with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the\nmock wedding was an actual wedding since Andy technically acted as their\nwitness and the supposedly fake minister was actually marrying them in German.\nHe tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on\nhis farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately\nkisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to\ntake care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).\nMichael still remains indecisive regarding what to buy, so he brings in a\nthird party: Hank (Hugh Dane) the security guard. However, Hank is more\ninterested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael\ncalls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that\nhe has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting\npaid a bonus equal to 15% of it. Michael then tells the employees that he is\nnot going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar realizes that\nMichael now knows about the 3rd option (Michael immediately says \"645 dollars\"\nwhen Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is but struggles to calculate 15% of\n200). Michael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees'\nintrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that\nthey will be unable to come to a consensus by the day's end and enable him to\ntake the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced\ninstead of remaining deadlocked, which upsets Michael. Later Michael is shown\nwearing a fur coat he had bought in anticipation of receiving the bonus, which\nhad fake blood thrown on it by activists. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try\nto get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, telling him that he\nis on \"dangerous ground\". Pam is nasty towards Jim during the entire debate,\nwhich Jim seems more easygoing about. However, at the end of the episode, Jim\ngets back at Pam for winning the debate by reverting to his earlier practice\nof having Pam make copies for him.\n\n## Reception\n\n\"The Surplus\" was voted the eighth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the\nfifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the\nepisode was rated 8.42 out of 10.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * This episode begins Ryan Howard's 11-episode absence from the office, as he went on vacation. He would return in \"Dream Team\".\n  * According to the commentary on this episode, B. J. Novak says that he was going to co-star in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds which is why his character is going to Thailand.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"The Surplus\" at NBC.com\n\n",
      "# New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\n\nThe New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of the\nChristian Bible was the first of three inclusive language versions of the New\nInternational Version (NIV). It was published by Hodder and Stoughton (a\nsubsidiary of Lagardere Publishing) in London in 1995; New Testament and\nPsalms, with the full bible following in 1996. It was only released in the\nUnited Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. In 1997, an article by\nWorld Magazine accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the\nevangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by\nJames Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI,\nZondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States. The front\ncover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from\nthe standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear\nit was a feminist/Inclusive Language version. One of the criticisms was that\nthe word \u2018man\u2019 was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way\n(\u2018anyone\u2019 \u2018person\u2019 etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation\nwith the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of\nthe word \u2018man\u2019. A corrected edition was published in 1999 as the last edition.\nIn 2002 Today's New International Version (TNIV) was published for the English\nspeaking world as a replacement, but differing in its title with the addition\nof 'Today's'. This was also discontinued, with a slightly toned-down version\nof the TNIV being published as the New International Version in 2011.\n\n## References\n\n",

In fact, Ev'rything's Coming Up\nDusty had been released in the US a few months prior, but as the title track\nof You Don't Have to Say You Love Me became a huge hit single for Springfield,\nPhilips USA decided to repackage and retitle the album after the single.

      "# Light of the Seven\n\n\"Light of the Seven\" is a piece in the HBO's series Game of Thrones, the\ntelevision series adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.\nIt first played during the season six finale of the show and was composed by\nRamin Djawadi in 2016. The \"Light of the Seven\" is the first time piano is\nused in the music for Game of Thrones. It was nominated by the International\nFilm Music Critics Association for Film Music Composition of the Year.\n\n## Background\n\nIn an interview, Djawadi spoke about \"Light of the Seven\", which largely\nconsisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, \"The\ninteresting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season\nshowrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of\nthe episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in\nepisode 10.' We talked about the 'Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be\na new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't\nwant to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We\ndiscussed it. The piano is not really in the language of the Game of Thrones\nscore.\" Djawadi had tried other instruments, including playing the whole tune\nwith harp, but none of them sounded right, eventually he settled on the colder\nsound of the piano. Djawadi said: \"It all felt like a perfect fit. What's\ngreat about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes\nlong. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then\ngive it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in\neither direction.\" Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical\nLannister theme, \"The Rains of Castamere\", in order to create more of a\nmystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison,\nand Djawadi instructed the boys to sing in such a way that although it is \"not\nout of tune, but you get that feeling of Something\u2019s wrong.\" Djawadi\ndescribing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by\nsaying \"The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all\ntogether. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately \u2014 the solo\nviolins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And\nthe organ as well.\" In another interview, Djawadi talked about the process,\nsaying, \"That was the big guidance for me, in how I wanted to build this\npiece, It's a different instrument, and I put it in an upper register, but the\nidea is that it's building something that stays the same but changes over\ntime. Of course, now that I say that, people might be like, 'No, it's not\nreally that.' And it's not staying true to the form. Obviously the picture is\nguiding me, so I have to pull back and break away from it. I couldn't keep it\nas a passacaglia all the way through. But there are definitely moments where\nit defaults to that.\"\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Light of the Seven\" has a duration of approximately ten minutes. When Djawadi\noriginally composed the piece, he intended at first to make it a passacaglia.\nThe instrumentation of \"Light of the Seven\" consists of piano, organ, strings\nand two boy soloists. On why he decided to use two young soloists instead of a\nfull choir, Djawadi said, \"I felt that two of them were more haunting than\nusing a full choir, because it's a smaller environment, when they're running\naround in the catacombs.\"\n\n## Credits and personnel\n\nPersonnel adapted from the album liner notes.\n\n  * Ramin Djawadi \u2013 composer, primary artist, producer\n\n  * David Benioff \u2013 liner notes\n  * D.B. Weiss \u2013 liner notes\n\n## Live performances\n\nDjawadi has performed the piece with a live orchestra at the Game of Thrones\nLive Concert Experience, which consisted of 24 dates in cities across the\nUnited States and Canada.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe piece received universal praise from critics and fans, with Lili\nLoofbourow of The Week calling it the \"real winner\" of the season finale.\nDjawadi responded to the universal praise the composition got, saying, \"I\nnever would have thought that would happen, It's so exciting because it's such\na special finale.\"\n\n## Aftermath\n\nA remixed version of \"Light of the Seven\" was used in a season 7 trailer. The\nfinal motif from this piece is used in the season 6 track \"Hear Me Roar\", and\nis also used from season 7 onwards in tracks involving Cersei Lannister and\nher machinations, such as \"The Long Farewell\" or \"No One Walks Away from Me\",\nacting as an alternate theme to \"The Rains of Castamere\" for her character.\n\n## Charts\n\n## Accolades\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\n## See also\n\n    * Game of Thrones Theme\n    * Music of Game of Thrones\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# Kate Barry\n\nCatharine Moore Barry ( October 1752\u2013 September 1823) was a heroine of the\nAmerican Revolutionary War. She was the daughter of Charles and Mary Moore,\nand the eldest of ten children. She married Andrew Barry in 1767 at the age of\n15 and lived on Walnut Grove Plantation in Roebuck, South Carolina during the\n18th century. She was instrumental in helping to warn the militia of the\ncoming British before the Battle of Cowpens in 1781. According to legend, she\ntied her toddler to the bedpost while she rode out to warn neighbors that the\nBritish were coming. Her warning helped to prepare the colonial forces to\ndefeat the British governor, Cornwallis and his men and drive them north, out\nof the state of South Carolina. She is buried in the family cemetery in Moore,\nSouth Carolina, beside her husband, Andrew, who was one of the first elders of\nthe Nazareth Presbyterian Church. She knew the Indian trails and shortcuts\nwhere almost no patriots lived. Barry was a spy and message bearer for the\nmilitia when the Battle of Cowpens was fought on January 17, 1781. The Battle\nof Cowpens (January 17, 1781) was a decisive victory by Continental army\nforces under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, in the Southern campaign of the\nAmerican Revolutionary War. It was a turning point in the reconquest of South\nCarolina from the British. Kate Barry was an ancestor of the actress Amanda\nBlake (1929-1989), remembered for the role of the red-haired saloon\nproprietress \"Miss Kitty Russell\" on the television western Gunsmoke. Blake\nplaced a cameo-sized portrait of Barry owned by her family in the Spartanburg,\nSouth Carolina local history museum, where it remains on display to this day.\n\n## References\n\n  * Silcox-Garrett, Diane.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is\nas well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in\nBible classes and children's ministries.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Committee on Bible Translation (CBT)\n  * Biblica\n  * Michael Marlowe on the NIV\n  * Read the New International Version (NIV) Bible \n  * \"Is Your Modern Translation Corrupt?\", Dr. James R.

Since then it has undergone\nthe following changes:\n\n  * NYBS formed Young Men's NYBS (YMNYBS) in 1823.\n  * NYBS broke up into Ward Associations in 1827.\n  * Ward Associations reformed into New York City Bible Society (NYCBS) in 1828.\n  * NYCBS merged back into the Young Men's NYBS in 1832.\n  * Marine Bible Society merged with YMNYBS in 1840. All became known as NYBS.\n  * Name changed to New York Bible Society International in 1971.\n  * Name changed to New York International Bible Society in 1974.\n  * Renamed International Bible Society (IBS) in 1988.\n  * Living Bibles International merger occurred in 1992.\n  * International Bible Society and Send the Light (STL) merged on March 1, 2007, forming a new organization called IBS-STL.\n  * Name changed to Biblica in 2009.\n\nThe organization moved to Colorado Springs from New York in 1988 and moved\ninto its current facility in 1989.\n\n## Translations\n\nBiblica's international ministry began in 1810 with its sponsorship of William\nCarey\u2019s Bible translation work in India. The worldwide work expanded in 1992\nfollowing the merger with Living Bibles International, through which Biblica\ndeveloped its global translation ministry. The reach of Biblica around the\nworld again expanded through its merger with Send the Light (STL) in 2007.\nBiblica is perhaps best known for its New International Version (NIV) version\nof the Bible, the best-selling contemporary English translation.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Bible society\n  * New International Version\n  * Zondervan\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\n\nThe New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of the\nChristian Bible was the first of three inclusive language versions of the New\nInternational Version (NIV). It was published by Hodder and Stoughton (a\nsubsidiary of Lagardere Publishing) in London in 1995; New Testament and\nPsalms, with the full bible following in 1996. It was only released in the\nUnited Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. In 1997, an article by\nWorld Magazine accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the\nevangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by\nJames Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI,\nZondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States. The front\ncover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from\nthe standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear\nit was a feminist/Inclusive Language version. One of the criticisms was that\nthe word \u2018man\u2019 was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way\n(\u2018anyone\u2019 \u2018person\u2019 etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation\nwith the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of\nthe word \u2018man\u2019. A corrected edition was published in 1999 as the last edition.\nIn 2002 Today's New International Version (TNIV) was published for the English\nspeaking world as a replacement, but differing in its title with the addition\nof 'Today's'. This was also discontinued, with a slightly toned-down version\nof the TNIV being published as the New International Version in 2011.\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# International Bible College\n\nInternational Bible College was a Christian Bible College located on northwest\nof historic downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Founded by Leonard Coote in\n1942, International Bible College was among the oldest Christian Colleges in\nTexas and the Southwest before it closed in 2010.\n\n## History\n\nInternational Bible College (now defunct) in San Antonio, was founded by Rev.\nLeonard W. Coote, an Oneness Pentecostal missionary to Japan. In 1942, when\nWorld War II temporarily halted his missionary efforts with the Japan\nApostolic Mission, Coote moved to San Antonio and began Emmanuel Gospel\nTabernacle (now Destiny Church) as well as IBC. He had previously established\na Bible training school for native workers in Ikoma, Japan, and wanted to\nbuild a similar Bible training center in the United States. The school,\nchartered as a nonprofit institution and dependent on private contributions\nfor support, was situated on a ten-acre campus atop \"Hallelujah Hill,\"\noverlooking San Antonio.\n\n### Peak enrollment and development\n\nIn 1965, the campus included 14 buildings; the library contained 3,000\nvolumes. By 1967 the campus included 19 buildings; that number grew to 27 by\n1995. Curriculum offerings in 1967 were a 2\u00bd-year course leading to a\nChristian worker's certificate, a three-year ministerial diploma course, and\ntwo four-year bible college courses-one leading to the Bachelor of Theology\ndegree (BTh) and the other to the Bachelor of Religious Education degree\n(BRE). Eventually IBC came to consider itself a \"nonsectarian school\", and at\nthe time of its closing was affiliated with the Oral Roberts University\nEducational Fellowship (ORUEF). Enrollment in 2001 was 91 full-time-equivalent\nstudents; faculty numbered 21. David W. Cook served as president until 2010.\n\n### Loss of certification and decline\n\nIBC was never accredited by a regional accrediting body but did obtain a\ncertificate of authority from the State of Texas authorizing it to grant\nbachelor's degrees in 1976. In the mid 1980s IBC began to face scrutiny from\nthe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and was required to gain\naccreditation from an accrediting body recognized by the State of Texas. When\nthe school failed to gain accreditation it was stripped of its ability to\ngrant degrees when its final certification expired on March 8, 1992. The\nschool was forced to change its name from International Bible College to\nInternational Bible Center. Enrollment steadily declined after the\ncertification was lost until the school closed in the fall of 2010.\n\n## Degrees\n\nThroughout most of its history IBC offered two baccalaureate degrees: the\nBachelor of Theology degree and the Bachelor of Religious Education degree. A\ntotal of 120 semester hours were to be completed, and for many years a 10,000\nword thesis was required. In addition it offered a three-year ministerial\ndiploma and one year Bible course. When it lost its ability to grant degrees\nin 1992 it began offering a Certificate of Biblical Studies, which required 64\nsemester hours, and a Diploma of Advanced Biblical Studies, requiring 128\nsemester hours.\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n",
      "# Luke\u2013Acts\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is the composite work of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the\nApostles in the New Testament. Both of these books of the Bible are credited\nto Luke. They also describe the narrative of those who continued to spread\nChristianity, ministry of Jesus and the subsequent ministry of the apostles\nand the Apostolic Age.\n\n## Authorship\n\nBoth the books of Luke and Acts are narratives written to a man named\nTheophilus. The book of Acts starts out with: \"The former treatise have I\nmade\", probably referring to the Gospel of Luke. Scholars believe that they\nwere written by the same person. Luke\u2013Acts has sometimes been presented as a\nsingle book in published Bibles or New Testaments, for example, in The\nOriginal New Testament (1985) and The Books of the Bible (2007). Luke is the\nlongest of the four gospels and the longest book in the New Testament;\ntogether with Acts of the Apostles it makes up a two-volume work from the same\nauthor, called Luke\u2013Acts. The cornerstone of Luke\u2013Acts' theology is \"salvation\nhistory\", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he\nhas acted, and will continue to act, in history.\n\n## Composition and setting\n\nIt divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with\nthe gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the arrival among men of Jesus\nthe Messiah, from his birth to the beginning of his earthly mission in the\nmeeting with John the Baptist followed by his earthly ministry, Passion,\ndeath, and resurrection (concluding the gospel story per se). The gospel's\nsources are the Gospel of Mark (for the narrative of Christ's earthly life),\nthe sayings collection called the Q source (for his teachings), and a\ncollection of material called the L (for Luke) source, which is found only in\nthis gospel. The work is Hellenized and written for a gentile audience\npossibly, in part, to counter a gnostic understanding of history. Marcion, a\nfamous 2nd-century heretic, who used a modified form of Luke known as the\nGospel of Marcion, did not use Acts, perhaps because he was unaware of it or\nintentionally excluded it from his biblical canon; Irenaeus, a proto-orthodox\napologist, is the first to use and mention Acts, specifically against\nMarcionism. Some scholars note that there are two versions of Luke\u2013Acts with\nthe longer version 10\u201320 percent longer than the shorter version. Scholars\ndisagree on which came first.\n\n## See also\n\n  * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n  * Joseph B.

      "# New International Version\n\nThe New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Bible\nfirst published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society).\nThe NIV was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible\nscholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal\nimportance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern\nEnglish. A team of 15 biblical scholars, representing a variety of\ndenominations, worked from the oldest copies of reliable texts, variously\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Each section was subjected to multiple\ntranslations and revisions, and those assessed in detail to produce the best\noption. Everyday Bible readers were used to provide feedback on ease of\nunderstanding and comprehensibility. Finally, plans were made to continue\nrevision of the Bible as new discoveries were made and as changes in the use\nof the English language occurred. The NIV is published by Zondervan in the\nUnited States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV was updated in 1984\nand 2011, and has become one of the most popular and best selling modern\ntranslations.\n\n## History\n\nThe NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the\nvalue of producing a translation in the common language of the American\npeople. The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity\nChristian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed\nChurch, National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international\nscholars. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie\nCarlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris,\nEarl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer,\nCharles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen\nW. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was\nselected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the\nfull Bible in 1978. The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1995 a new\nversion of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full\nBible following in 1996 as the New International Version Inclusive Language\nEdition, but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from\nconservative evangelical groups there to inclusive language. A further edition\nwith minor edits was published in 1999.\n\n### 2011 update\n\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released. The update modified and\ndropped some of the gender-neutral language of the TNIV (such as going back to\nusing \"mankind\" and \"man\" instead of \"human beings\" and \"people\"), along with\nother changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.\nKeith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the\nTNIV, said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and\nunderestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\n\n### Derivative versions\n\n#### Plain English version (NIrV)\n\nAn 'easy-reader' version, New International Reader's Version (NIrV), was\npublished in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\n\n#### Spanish version (NVI)\n\nIn 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish\nwith the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated\nNVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English\ntranslation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990 the committee on Bible\ntranslation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a\ntranslation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both\ntestaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI\nBible in 1999.\n\n## Textual basis\n\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the\nDead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and\nTheodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and\nfor the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New\nTestament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies\nand of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the\ntranslation.\n\n## Translation methodology\n\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using\nHebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern\nEnglish language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten\nyears and involved a team of over 100 scholars. from the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The\nrange of those participating included many different denominations such as\nAnglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and\nPresbyterian. The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-\nthought or literal and phrase by phrase translations. Recent archaeological\nand linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have\ntraditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional\ntranslations were generally retained.\n\n## Circulation\n\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International\nVersion has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible\nin CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. There\nare numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and\nbackground information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among\nthese are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study\nBible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision,\nReflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.\n\n## Reception\n\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured\nwhat Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to\nProtestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly,\nrelies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was\ntalking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim,\nWright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do\nnot convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or\nreflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the\nNIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's\nspecific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to\nthe 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus\nChrist\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans\n3:22. Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such\nas the NRSV uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense \"So out of the ground the LORD\nGod formed every animal...\". Some have questioned the NIV choice of pluperfect\n\"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals...\" to try\nto make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John\nSailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation ... hardly possible ... but\nit misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were\ncreated in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man\nshould be alone.\" Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984\nedition for the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For\nwhen I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I\ndid not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger\nalso criticized the addition of your into , so it becomes \"Though it (the\nmustard seed) is the smallest of all your seeds.\" The usage of your was\nremoved in the 2011 revision. Non-literal translation is used to give\ninterpretations, such as in , which the NIV translates as \"for we also forgive\neveryone who sins against us\" rather than \"for we also forgive every one that\nis indebted to us\", or translating the Greek word \"sarx\" (flesh) as \"sinful\nnature\".\n\n### 2011 revision\n\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update,\ncalling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through\nrigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy,\nand a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible\nappealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected\nthe 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped\nsome gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher\nLifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores.\nWhile the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations\nchanges are right and defensible. Professor of New Testament Studies, Rodney\nJ. Decker, wrote in Themelios Journal review of the NIV 2011 that, By taking a\nmediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending,\nI think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to\nproduce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those\nweighted more heavily with formal equivalence...If we are serious about making\nthe word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then\nwe must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the\naverage English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only\ncommunicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in\nEnglish that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is\nas well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in\nBible classes and children's ministries.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Committee on Bible Translation (CBT)\n  * Biblica\n  * Michael Marlowe on the NIV\n  * Read the New International Version (NIV) Bible \n  * \"Is Your Modern Translation Corrupt?\", Dr. James R.

      "# Do You Want to Know a Secret\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles\nfrom their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison. In the United\nStates, it was the first top ten song to feature Harrison as a lead singer,\nreaching No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1964 as a single released by Vee-Jay,\nVJ 587.\n\n## Composition\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", written in autumn 1962, was primarily composed\nby John Lennon but credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The 1963 version by Billy J.\nKramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to\n\"McCartney\u2013Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt\nDisney\u2019s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's\nmother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the\nsong in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come\nright after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love\nyou... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it\nwas a \"50\u201350 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but\nLennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview\nthat he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best\nsuited Harrison.\n\n## Recording\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison\nto sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the\nworld\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as\npart of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along\nwith nine other songs for Please Please Me. Harrison sang two songs on Please\nPlease Me\u2014this song by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't\nBother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles'\nnext UK album With the Beatles. Harrison and Lennon both played acoustic\nguitars on the recording in different channels \u2013 Harrison's guitar was panned\nto the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n## Single release\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-\nJay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind\nanother Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in Billboard, reaching number three\non the Cash Box chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart\npublished by the Teletheatre Research Institute. In the U.S., it was the most\nsuccessful Beatles song on which Harrison sang lead vocal until \"Something\"\npeaked at #1 as part of a double-sided number one hit with \"Come Together\" in\n1969.\n\n## Personnel\n\n  * George Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (right channel)\n  * John Lennon \u2013 acoustic guitar (left channel), backing vocals\n  * Paul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n  * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tapped drumsticks\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith Personnel per Walter Everett and John Winn\n\n## Charts and certifications\n\n### Charts\n\n### Certifications\n\n## The Billy J.

It tells of a couple who\npromise to love each other. The song's narrator tells of being with his\ngrandfather, and reading a note that was written by his late grandmother back\nwhen both grandparents were younger. The grandfather explains that he had\nintended to meet her at a certain tree: \"If you get there before I do, don't\ngive up on me / I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how\nlong I'll be / But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see / And\nbetween now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you / Love, me.\" In\nthe second verse, the narrator and his grandfather are at a church where they\nstopped to pray just before the late grandmother died, and the grandfather\nreads the note and begins to cry, that is the first time that he ever saw his\ngrandfather crying.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video was directed by Peter Lippman and premiered in late 1991.\n\n## Chart positions\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# Middle income trap\n\nThe middle income trap is a theoretical economic development situation in\nwhich a country that attains a certain income (due to given advantages) gets\nstuck at that level. The World Bank defines as the 'middle-income range'\ncountries with gross national product per capita that has remained between\n$1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nAccording to the idea, a country in the middle income trap has lost its\ncompetitive edge in the export of manufactured goods because of rising wages.\nHowever, it is unable to keep up with more developed economies in the high-\nvalue-added market. As a result, newly industrialised economies such as South\nAfrica and Brazil have not, for decades, left what the World Bank defines as\nthe 'middle-income range' since their per capita gross national product has\nremained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices. They suffer from\nlow investment, slow growth in the secondary industry, limited industrial\ndiversification and poor labor market conditions.\n\n## Avoidance\n\nAvoiding the middle income trap entails identifying strategies to introduce\nnew processes and find new markets to maintain export growth. Ramping up\ndomestic demand is also important\u2014an expanding middle class can use its\nincreasing purchasing power to buy high-quality, innovative products and help\ndrive growth. The biggest challenge is moving from resource-driven growth that\nis dependent on cheap labor and capital to growth based on high productivity\nand innovation. This requires investments in infrastructure and\neducation\u2014building a high-quality education system that encourages creativity\nand supports breakthroughs in science and technology that can be applied back\ninto the economy.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Dual-sector model\n  * Human capital\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n  * Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century\n  * Indonesia Risks Falling into the Middle Income Trap\n  * Philippines Faces Middle Income Trap\n  * Russians are stuck in 'Middle Income Trap'\n  * Latin America's Middle Income Trap\n  * How China can avoid the middle income trap\n  * \"The Middle-Income Trap.

      "# Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\n\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the opening song from the musical Oklahoma!,\nwhich premiered on Broadway in 1943. It was written by composer Richard\nRodgers and lyricist/librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The leading male\ncharacter in Oklahoma!, Curly McLain, sings the song at the beginning of the\nfirst scene of the musical. The refrain runs: \"Oh, what a beautiful mornin'! /\nOh, what a beautiful day! / I've got a beautiful feelin' / Ev'rythin's goin'\nmy way.\" Curly's \"brimming optimism is perfectly captured by Rodgers'\nebullient music and Hammerstein's buoyant pastoral lyrics.\" This was the first\nsong of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical collaboration to be heard by theatre\naudiences. It has become one of their most famous numbers and \"quickly became\none of the most popular American songs to emerge from the wartime era, gaining\ncurrency away from Broadway first on the radio and recordings, and then later\non numerous television variety shows.\" Brooks Atkinson, reviewing the original\nproduction in The New York Times, wrote that the number changed the history of\nmusical theatre: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the\nbanalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\"\n\n## Noteworthy recordings\n\nNoteworthy recordings include the following:\n\n  * Bing Crosby and Trudy Erwin recorded the song in 1943 for Decca, as the B-side of a single covering \"People Will Say We're In Love\". The recording peaked at No. 4 on US charts.\n  * Frank Sinatra recorded the song as a single in 1943, released by Columbia Records as catalogue number 36682, it reached the No. 12 spot in the charts. The song appears on more than two dozen Frank Sinatra compilations. Sinatra first recorded the song a cappella: \"a musician's strike ... occurred just as Sinatra was set to enter the studio and lay down his first tracks under the Columbia banner, so ... Sinatra went into the studio with a group of vocalists and recorded several songs ... a cappella\".\n  * Ray Charles recorded the song several times, and one of his live recordings from the 1970s with the Count Basie Orchestra is included on his posthumous album Ray Sings, Basie Swings (2006)\n  * Eels included the song on their live album Oh What a Beautiful Morning (2000).\n  * James Taylor recorded the song in 2008 and released it as a bonus track on his album Covers (2008) and also on his album Other Covers (2009).\n  * Sharon, Lois & Bram recorded a version and performed it on their television program, Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show.\n\nOther artists who have recorded the song include Rosemary Clooney on several\nof her albums, Peggy Lee, Nelson Eddy, and Joanie Bartels. Classical singers\nwho have recorded it include Placido Domingo, Bryn Terfel, Marilyn Horne and\nSamuel Ramey, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir made a choral version.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nEthan Mordden titled his book about the dawn of the \"Golden Age\" of musicals\nBeautiful Mornin: The Broadway Musical in the 1940s (1999).\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\": Gordon MacRae sings the song in the original film version (1955)\n  * \"Great Performances\" version: Hugh Jackman sings the song in the PBS production of Oklahoma!

      "# Joel DiGregorio\n\nWilliam Joel \"Taz\" DiGregorio (January 8, 1944 \u2013 October 12, 2011) was a\nlongtime member and keyboardist for the Charlie Daniels Band. He was born and\nlived in Southbridge, Massachusetts until 1962 when he went on the road. He\nwas self-taught on the keyboards, practicing from tunes by Elvis Presley, Fats\nDomino, and Little Richard following his attendance at a Ray Charles concert.\n\n## Musical career\n\nHe learned the Fats Domino song \"Blue Monday\" at the age of sixteen. Once, he\njust started playing and singing the entire song and his sister asked him \"How\ndid you do that?\" and he replied \"I don't know\" and that kickstarted his\ncareer. He once played with a band at The Golden Nugget in Worcester,\nMassachusetts and played with Fay Adams & The Drifters. He fulfilled his goal\nof becoming a professional musician, initiating his career with his first\nband, the group Paul Chaplain and his Emeralds, best known for their minor hit\n\"Shortnin' Bread\" (1960). They sold about 250,000 copies of their album in\n1959. He was on the album at the age of seventeen and he didn't know a lot\nabout life and music, but he knew 8 chords and he recorded the song, Shortnin'\nBread, and it became a hit. By the early 1960s, the group disbanded, leaving\nDiGregorio to find other gigs which included playing in a lounge band in\nFlorida under the name of Little Joe and the Romans with Bill B. on guitar,\nBobby J. on drums, and Ben on bass. They also played at Benny's Rebel Room in\nWashington, DC and various lounges and clubs in Lexington, Kentucky, Dayton,\nOhio and Syracuse, New York. In Lexington, Charlie sat in at the Southland\nBowl lounge and, even then was well liked by the audience. It was rumored back\nthen that Joel stuck popsicle sticks into broken organ keys to make the broken\nkeys playable in his earlier years. This was observed by band members while\nplaying at Benny's Rebel Room in 1965. In 1964, he was working with a band\nthat played different types of music. He sang and played bass pedals on the\norgan. There was a saxophone player in the band named Jerry Kaskie, who was\nthen drafted into the military. Then, they hired a guitarist, who was also\ndrafted. Taz then got a job at a club called the LaFlame near the Air Force\nbase in Orlando. Charlie Daniels went there as the main attraction once, and\nhis guitarist quit and he was playing bass. They decided to have lunch\ntogether and Daniels told Joel that if he cut his hair, he could play in his\nband called the Jaguars. A few years later, DiGregorio was drafted and served\nwith the US Army. Upon his return home, he resumed his career with Daniels and\nfollowing some ensemble changes The Charlie Daniels Band launched what became\na commercially successful body of work, beginning with their self-titled debut\nalbum in 1970. In 1979, their signature hit \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia,\"\nwhich achieved a number 3 placing on the US Pop Charts, was co-written by\nDiGregorio. In addition to his work with Daniels, he recorded the solo\nprojects Midnight in Savannah (2008) and Shake Rag (2008).\n\n### Charlie Daniels Band\n\nThe original Charlie Daniels Band was Charlie, Jerry Corbitt from the\nYoungbloods, Billy Cox from the Band of Gypsys, Jeffrey Meyer, and Taz. They\nstayed together for six months, but then it didn't work out. After that, it\nwas Charlie, Taz, Jeffrey, and Earl Grigsby. The original Charlie Daniels Band\ncan still be heard on a bootleg album called \"Corbitt and Daniels, Live from\nCarnegie Hall.\"\n\n## Nickname\n\nFrom the Charlie Daniels Band album Te John, Grease, & Wolfman, which the name\ncomes from the band members' nicknames, \"Te John\" was the bassist, \"Wolfman\"\nthe drummer, and Joel, being that he was half Italian and half French Canadian\nwas \"Grease\". According to DiGregorio, \"Charlie loves giving people\nnicknames,\" which is \"one of those Southern rock cultural things.\" Taz got his\nnickname from when they were on the tour bus with their first road manager\nnamed Jesse Craig. Joel had his hair down past his shoulders and once, his\nhair was sticking up and Jesse was laughing and saying that he looked like a\nTasmanian devil. Then Charlie was joking around and called him \"Taz\". The\nnickname \"Grease\" never stuck, but \"Taz\" did.\n\n## Death\n\nDiGregorio was killed in a single car accident on Interstate 40 in Cheatham\nCounty, Tennessee, on October 12, 2011. He was driving to meet the band's tour\nbus, which was headed to a concert set for Wednesday night in Cumming,\nGeorgia. He was 67 years old.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# You Are My Sunshine\n\n\"You Are My Sunshine\" is a song popularized by Jimmie Davis and Charles\nMitchell in 1939. It has been declared one of the state songs of Louisiana\nbecause of its association with Davis, a country music singer and governor of\nthe state in the years 1944\u20131948 and 1960\u20131964. The song has been covered\nnumerous times \u2014 so often, in fact, that it is \"one of the most commercially\nprogrammed numbers in American popular music.\" The song, originally country\nmusic, has \"virtually lost\" its original country music identity, and\n\"represent[s] both the national flowering of country music and its eventual\nabsorption into the mainstream of American popular culture.\" In 1941, it was\ncovered by Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Mississippi John Hurt, Wayne King and\nLawrence Welk. The versions by Autry, Crosby, and King reached the US charts\nof the day. In subsequent years, it was covered by Doris Day (1951), Nat King\nCole (1955), The Marcels (1961), Ray Charles (1962), Ike & Tina Turner, The\nRivingtons (1962), Andy Williams (1963), Burl Ives (1968), Frank Turner, The\nBeach Boys, Aretha Franklin, Anne Murray (1979), Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis,\nJohnny Cash, Norman Blake , Brian Wilson, Mouse and the Traps, Gene Vincent,\nJamey Johnson, Low, Mose Allison, Bryan Ferry, Carly Simon, Madeline Eastman,\nYusuf Islam, Copeland, Johnny and the Hurricanes, and Barbra Lica (2012),\namongst many others. The 1940 version by Davis has been added to the National\nRecording Registry in the Library of Congress on March 21, 2013, for long-term\npreservation. Virginia Shehee, a long-time Davis family friend and member of\nthe Louisiana State Senate from 1976 to 1980, introduced legislation to make\n\"You Are My Sunshine\" the official state song.\n\n## Early recordings\n\nTwo versions of \"You Are My Sunshine\" were recorded and released in 1939 prior\nto Jimmie Davis' version. The first was recorded for Bluebird Records (RCA-\nVictor's budget label) on August 22, 1939, by The Pine Ridge Boys (Marvin\nTaylor and Doug Spivey), who were from Atlanta. The second was recorded for\nDecca Records on September 13, 1939, by The Rice Brothers Gang. This group was\noriginally from north Georgia but relocated to Shreveport, where they were\nperforming on the radio station KWKH. The version by Jimmie Davis was recorded\nfor Decca Records on February 5, 1940.\n\n## Authorship\n\nWhile Davis and Mitchell are the credited songwriters of \"You Are My\nSunshine\", Davis was never known to actually claim authorship, as he bought\nthe song and rights from Paul Rice and put his own name on it, a practice not\nuncommon in the pre-World War II music business, though some early versions of\nthe song credit it to the Rice Brothers. Descendants and associates of Oliver\nHood, a LaGrange, Georgia, musician who collaborated with Rice, state that\nHood wrote the song in the early 1930s and first performed it at a Veterans of\nForeign Wars convention at LaGrange, Georgia, in 1933. According to OffBeat\nmagazine, clarinetist Pud Brown was also involved with the Rice Brothers for\nthe song's origin or first arrangement. Davis said that for some time he had\nbeen enthusiastic about the song and had unsuccessfully tried to convince\nrecord companies to record it before finally making his own 1940 record of the\nsong. Davis' version was popular and was followed by numerous other covers,\nincluding those of Bing Crosby and Gene Autry, whose versions made the number\na big hit. Davis emphasized his association with the song when running for\ngovernor of Louisiana in 1944, singing it at all his campaign rallies while\nriding on a horse named \"Sunshine\".\n\n## In popular culture\n\nFilm appearances\n\n* Take Me Back to Oklahoma (1940) \u2013 sung by Tex Ritter\n* Strictly in the Groove (1942) \u2013 sung by Jimmie Davis.\n* Meet Me in St. Gallen (2018) - sung by Moira Dela Torre\n* Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins (1975)\n* O Brother, Where Art Thou?

      "# The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)\n\nThe Prisoners are fictional characters from the comic book series The Walking\nDead and the television series of the same name.\n\n## Appearances\n\n### Comic book series\n\nDuring Rick's coma, due to the news broadcasts, the inmates and guards had a\nbasic understanding of what was going on. Soon, many of the guards abandoned\nthe prison and the inmates to fend for themselves; at about the same time, a\nfew walkers had somehow gotten inside and began to kill the inmates. Several\nof the guards freed the inmates and joined together to fight their way out,\nresulting in heavy casualties. By the time Rick and his group discovered the\nprison, it was discovered that there were only four survivors left who were\nlocked up inside the cafeteria. The two groups come into conflict after one of\nthem, Thomas Richards, kills two of the survivors, Rachel and Susie Greene,\nHershel Greene's two youngest twin daughters. Dexter is falsely accused of the\ncrime due to him being the \"only\" prisoner who was arrested for murder (it is\nlater revealed that Thomas was arrested for murder as well and initially lied\nabout being arrested for committing tax fraud). Thomas also tries to kill\nAndrea who is left without an earlobe and two scars as well as Patricia. Rick\nsaves Andrea who beats Thomas brutally, and the second attempted murder on\nPatricia's life is stopped by a vengeful Maggie, who empties her entire\nfirearm magazine into Thomas. After Thomas is killed, Dexter and Andrew try to\nkick out Rick's group, resulting in walkers flooding the courtyard. During the\nstruggle, Rick shoots Dexter in the head, covering it up as friendly-fire, and\nAndrew surrenders, running outside the gates to die. Axel, the only prisoner\nto side with Rick, joins the group and later becomes a vital and trusted\nmember of the group until he is killed during the second assault on the Prison\nfrom Woodbury.\n\n### Television series\n\nThe prisoners debut in \"Sick\" where they witness Rick amputating the lower\nportion of Hershel's leg after he is bitten by walkers. Rick makes a deal with\nthe Prisoners to clear out a cell block for them in exchange for half of their\nfood. Tomas brutally Big Tiny after he is scratched by a walker, despite the\nlatter's pleas that he doesn't feel any effects. Tomas tries twice to\nassassinate Rick while clearing out the cells, so Rick kills Tomas with his\nmachete, and chases Andrew and locks him in a courtyard full of walkers. Rick,\nDaryl, and T-Dog hold Axel and Oscar at gunpoint; Axel begs for his life, but\nOscar refuses to beg. Rick's group shows mercy on them and allows them to stay\nin the prison, though he and Oscar are told to stay in another block. Oscar\nand Axel find it very disturbing to stay with their deceased inmates and begs\nRick to let them stay. T-Dog sympathizes with the prisoners and asks Rick to\nlet them join the group, but Rick is adamant about keeping to their earlier\ncompromise. Later, a horde of walkers is let into the prison courtyard,\nresulting in the deaths of T-Dog and Lori. When the prison's sirens sound off,\nOscar explains that the back-up generators are powering the alarms, and takes\nRick to shut them down. Andrew, who survived and is revealed to have let the\nwalkers loose and turned on the alarms, attacks Rick in the generator room.\nOscar kills Andrew, and Oscar and Axel are then allowed to stay with the\nothers. Axel and Oscar helps dig graves for those who died during the walker\nattack. Axel volunteers to go to Woodbury, but stays behind to protect the\nprison. Oscar instead decides to go. During his plan to rescue Glenn Rhee and\nMaggie Greene, members of Rick's group, Oscar is shot dead by a Woodbury\nsoldier. At the prison, Axel soon tries to win the favor of the group by\ntrying to stir up conversations and takes a liking to Beth and Carol, flirting\nwith them both. He is later shown saddened by Oscar's death. Axel, Hershel,\nand Beth, visit new arrivals Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben. He helps the\ngroup fortify the prison, and becomes friendly with Carol by telling her\nstories of his criminal past. He reveals that he was sentenced for trying to\nrob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the police did not believe him and\nfound his brother's gun and assumed it to be the real weapon and he was\nincarcerated. He is killed by The Governor by a shot to the head as part of a\nsurprise attack initiating his assault on the prison.\n\n## Casting and television series reception\n\nAndrew was portrayed by actor and rapper Markice Moore. He had originally\nauditioned for the pilot episode for the role of T-Dog, which went to IronE\nSingleton. Moore was later cast on season 3 as Andrew through his agency:\n\"Production was very hush hush about season 3 so I didn't even know I booked\nit officially until a week before shooting. I was elated; I couldn't believe\nit when my manager, Gail Tassell called to tell me the good news. I'm a huge\nfan of the show, it's my favorite show on TV, so yes it was a dream come\ntrue.\" Per Glen Mazzara, \"Andrew is really Tomas' right-hand man. These guys\nare really the ones who have been intimidating Axel and Oscar.\" Lew Temple was\nalso cast as Axel. He described him as a \"a gregarious Southern redneck-biker\ntype, who has big heart\" and \"a sense of compassion for his fellow man, but he\nis not as meek as he might appear, and though he has had to survive with four\nother hardened criminals, sans Oscar, this brave new world is something\nentirely different for him. He wants to associate and assimilate into the\ngroup of survivors, to the point of trying too hard to be accepted. He has a\nwry sense of humor and ironic quick wit. He will make you laugh and cry in the\nsame offering.\" Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that \"things\nbecome sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew\ninto a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick\ndoes not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a\ngrowing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter\nnoted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea\nof walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that\nthis decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of\nmurder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group\nand forced his own son to put down his mother\". Los Angeles Times columnist\nLaura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open\nthe lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you\nconsider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with\nvendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of Slant Magazine described\nthe episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a\nconspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of\ndisconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene\nends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a\nforeboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden\nstrike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how\nthe episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in\nthe show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode\n\"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking\nlengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan\nSepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it\nhelps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first\nplace. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who\nprobably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the\ngate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for Rolling Stone magazine that\nwhen Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar\nshoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers\nthat Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in\nthe series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I\nloved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people\nwith him! [...] Die Hard TWD fans will remember my character forever because\nof all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick! The fight scenes\nwere great! Especially in my death scene.\" Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club\nin his review of \"Sick\", joked of Oscar and Axel, \"I'm sure the remaining\nprisoners are completely harmless. They said they were harmless\u2014why would they\nlie?\" Showrunner Glen Mazzara commented that in \"Killer Within\", Axel and\nOscar want to be let into the group so they \"prove themselves, which is why\nOscar takes action and kills Andrew (Markice Moore), so that he can gain\naccess to the group. Throughout the entire season, it's a major theme: Who can\nRick let in? Not just into the prison, but let in emotionally.\" Los Angeles\nTimes columnist Laura Hudson observed tribalism as a trope in \"Killer Within\",\nwhich she ascribed to the reluctance of Maggie, Rick, and others in the group\nto allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. Hudson noted that these characters\nhad been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past\ncivilization for so long that they have reverted to \"traveling in a small,\ntightly knit group, hunting and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part\nof their it as a deadly threat.\" Zack Handlen commented in his review of \"Made\nto Suffer\" that \"Axel's enthusiasm for getting laid is sending off all kinds\nof creepy vibes, just the way he got real interested when he found out Beth\nwas 17 could be a bad sign. (His assumption that Carol was a lesbian was kind\nof funny, though.)\" Lew Temple found out about Axel's death about two weeks\nbefore the episode \"Home\" was filmed: \"[Glen Mazzara] had just come down to\nscreen the season 3 premiere episode for cast and crew on location. It was\ngreat! It was a lovely evening. We celebrated an amazing kick-off to a great\nnew season. And that particular night was the first time I had met Glen in\nperson. We had a really nice visit about what we were doing with Axel, and he\nwas so effusive and kind and lovely, saying \"I really dig how you're bringing\nAxel out, and the layers that are there. We can go in so many directions\nbecause you're keeping things close to the vest and we're not sure what he's\nabout.\" So I was fairly excited, and I got a call from his assistant the next\nday saying Glen wanted to speak with me, and I'm like oh, great!, assuming\nhe's going to want to speak more about character development. 15 to 20 seconds\ninto the conversation he says, \"Lew, this is really unfortunate but I've got\nto let you know that Axel is going to take a bullet to the head.\" Eric Goldman\nat IGN thought the death of Axel was a huge surprise. Phil Dyess-Nugent,\nwriting for The A.V. Club, commented that in his earlier appearances, \"Lew\nTemple managed to invest Axel with a certain mangy charm, and he really\nblossoms in this episode; when he's chatting up Carol and shining a little\nwhite-trash charm, I found myself thinking, \"Shit, I'm glad this guy's\naround,\" which is a thought I haven't had about Rick or Glenn or Maggie or\nHershel in living memory. Unfortunately, the show itself seems to share Rick's\ndistrust of letting in strangers.\"\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Remember Me (T.I. song)\n\n\"Remember Me\" was the planned first single from the re-release of T.I.'s sixth\nalbum, Paper Trail; however, the re-release was eventually shelved, although\nthe song would still be released digitally.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the UK, the song was released as a single and was taken from an EP,\nentitled Paper Trail: Case Closed. It features Mary J. Blige. The song was\nofficially released to urban radio the week of July 7, 2009. The main message\nof the song is remembrance. Its original title was \"Don't Forget.\" The song is\nabout T.I.'s jail sentence and how he wants people to remember him as he is\nnot going to be gone forever, including the verse \"By the time you hear this,\nI'd be half way home.\" It also talks about the hard times in his life and how\nhe does not give up. In the song T.I. mentions Martin Luther King and Malcolm\nX and how he is the modern day version of them. With no promotion the single\nsold over 80,000 downloads in its first week, and it debuted at No. 29 on the\nBillboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video was directed by Jessy Terrero, and follows on from the themes of the\nsong, showing prisoners being forgotten by their significant others while\nincarcerated. A trailer was posted on June 15, 2009, and the full video was\nreleased on July 13, 2009, and it was later released on iTunes on July 28. The\nbeginning of the video starts where Dead and Gone left off, with T.I. being\nled to a prison cell to begin a sentence. T.I. then appears inside of his\nhouse, but he cannot be seen by anyone else. He finds his wife and another man\ncelebrating after finding out T.I. was going to prison. Two other prisoners\nare featured in similar scenarios, where they appear outside of their homes\nbut cannot be seen. One inmate sees his girlfriend cheating on him in front of\nhis daughter, and another sees his girlfriend throw a letter he wrote to her\nin a trash can. The video ends with T.I. being released from prison.\n\n## Track listing\n\nDigital single\n\n## Chart Positions\n\n## References\n\n",
      "# O. Henry's Full House\n\nO. Henry's Full House is a 1952 American anthology film made by 20th Century\nFox, consisting of five films, each based on a story by O. Henry. The film was\nproduced by Andr\u00e9 Hakim and directed by five directors from five screenplays\nwith different authors. The music score was composed by Alfred Newman. The\nfilm is narrated by author John Steinbeck, who made his only on-camera\nappearance to introduce each story. Howard Hawks \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" was\nso poorly received that the studio removed it before the film opened widely.\n\n## The five stories\n\n### \"The Cop and the Anthem\"\n\nDirected by Henry Koster, from a screenplay by Lamar Trotti, it stars Charles\nLaughton, Marilyn Monroe and David Wayne. As winter approaches, a vagrant\ndecides it's time for his annual winter spell in prison. But no matter how\nhard he tries, he cannot get himself arrested.\n\n### \"The Clarion Call\"\n\nDirected by Henry Hathaway, from a screenplay by Richard L. Breen, it stars\nDale Robertson and Richard Widmark. Plot: A detective cannot arrest a murderer\nhe knows from his past due to his honor involving an outstanding financial\ndebt to the criminal. Once a newspaper offers a reward, after being mocked by\nthe criminal, the detective arrests the criminal and collects the reward to\nrepay the debt. This vignette reunited Henry Hathaway and Richard Widmark\nwho'd worked together on the noir classic Kiss of Death (1947). Widmark's\ncharacter in The Clarion Call, \"Johnny Kernan\", is actually a reprise of his\nOscar-nominated character \"Tommy Udo\" from Kiss of Death. Widmark's Udo/Kernan\ncharacter was inspired by his love of Batman comics' \"The Joker\". The Tommy\nUdo performance in turn influenced Frank Gorshin in preparation for his\n\"Riddler\" character on the Batman TV series in the 1960s.\n\n### \"The Last Leaf\"\n\nDirected by Jean Negulesco, from a screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, it\nstars Anne Baxter, Jean Peters, and Gregory Ratoff. The story is set in\nGreenwich Village during a pneumonia epidemic. An old artist saves the life of\na young artist, dying of pneumonia, by giving her the will to live. She can\nsee an ivy plant through the window gradually losing its leaves, and has taken\nit into her head that she will die when the last leaf falls. Seemingly, it\nnever does fall, and she survives. In reality, the vine lost all its leaves.\nWhat she thought she saw was in actuality a leaf, painted on the wall with\nperfect realism, by the old artist. The old artist dies of a heart attack\nwhile out in the wet and cold, painting the last leaf.\n\n### \"The Ransom of Red Chief\"\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks, from a screenplay by Ben Hecht, Nunnally Johnson and\nCharles Lederer, it stars Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Lee Aaker. Two con men\nkidnap a child in order to collect a substantial ransom, but the child proves\nto be too much for them.\n\n### \"The Gift of the Magi\"\n\nDirected by Henry King, from a screenplay by Walter Bullock, it stars Jeanne\nCrain and Farley Granger. On Christmas Eve, with little money, Della sells her\nhair to buy her husband Jim a watch fob. Jim has sold his watch to buy her a\npair of ornamental combs. When they exchange these now useless gifts, they\nrealize how deep is their love for one another.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Review at TimeOut Film\n  * Review at Channel 4 Film\n  * Review at Family Friendly Movies\n\n",

Writing for The New York Times, Daniel M. Gold described the plot as\n\"a tangle of dithering storylines\" and Levesque's acting as \"inert\". The New\nYork Post's Lou Lumenick derided Inside Out as \"nonsensical, thickly plotted\ngumbo\" which he found to be unintentionally funnier than Levesque's other\nstarring role in the comedy film The Chaperone. However, Eric Hynes of The\nVillage Voice was more positive, praising the film as a \"meandering,\neccentric, downright adorable existential crime yarn\", while noting that\nLevesque's performance was closer to \"a steroidal Steven Seagal\" than \"Hackman\nor Cagney\".\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Tom Donahue\n\nTom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (May 21, 1928 \u2013 April 28, 1975), was an American rock\nand roll radio disc jockey, record producer and concert promoter.\n\n## Early life\n\nDonahue was born Thomas Coman in South Bend, Indiana, United States. His\ncareer started in 1949 on the East Coast of the U.S. at WTIP in West Virginia\nand continued at WIBG in Philadelphia and WINX in Maryland. He moved to San\nFrancisco in 1961 during the payola scandal involving Alan Freed, Dick Clark\nand several other East Coast DJs. He was brought to San Francisco by Les\nCrane, former Program Director at WIBG who had been hired to \"make a winner\nout of loser station\", KYA. Crane also brought in Peter Tripp from WMGM, New\nYork and \"Bobby Mitchell\" from WIBG.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile a disc jockey at Top Forty station KYA (now KOIT) in San Francisco,\nDonahue and Mitchell formed a record label. Autumn Records had subsequent hits\nwith Bobby Freeman and The Mojo Men, and Sly Stone was a staff producer. But\nAutumn's biggest act was one that Donahue discovered, produced, recorded, and\nmanaged, The Beau Brummels, which he later sold to Warner Bros. Records. He\nalso opened a psychedelic nightclub, Mothers, on Broadway in San Francisco,\nand produced concerts at the Cow Palace, the Oakland Auditorium and\nCandlestick Park with his partner Mitchell (later known as Bobby Tripp in Los\nAngeles radio; real name Michael Guerra, d. 1968). Together, they produced the\nlast public appearance of The Beatles on August 29, 1966 at Candlestick Park.\nDonahue wrote a 1967 Rolling Stone article titled \"AM Radio Is Dead and Its\nRotting Corpse Is Stinking Up the Airwaves\", which also lambasted the Top\nForty format. He subsequently took over programming for a foreign-language\nstation KMPX and changed it into what is considered to be America's first\nalternative \"free-form\" radio station. The station played album tracks chosen\nby the DJs on the largely ignored FM band. This one move introduced\nprogressive radio to the U.S. In 1969, besides his roles as a DJ, station\nmanager, and live show producer, he also managed Leigh Stephens (former lead\nguitarist of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Blue Cheer), Micky\nWaller (a British drummer who played in the Steampacket, Brian Auger, Julie\nDriscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Jeff Beck Group, 1968-69), and Pete\nSears in the band Silver Metre, and in 1970 Stoneground. Donahue, and his DJ\nwife Raechel also took over programming of free-form radio stations KMET and\nKPPC-FM in Los Angeles. In 1972, he moved to the role of general manager at\nKSAN, where he encouraged DJs to play music from different eras and genres\ninterspersed with interesting commentary. A re-created example of Donahue's DJ\nshow can be found on the album The Golden Age Of Underground Radio.\n\n## Death\n\nDonahue died from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 46. He was inducted\ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a non-performer, one of only\nthree disc jockeys to receive that honor. In 2006, Donahue was inducted into\nthe Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the first class of broadcasters\nenshrined.

It is\nlocated near the Cliff House restaurant, perched on the headlands on the\ncliffs just north of Ocean Beach. The Camera and restaurant are currently\nowned by the National Park Service and are within the Golden Gate National\nRecreation Area. The Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of\nHistoric Places in 2001 and is within the NPS Sutro Historic District. It is\nwithin the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, since being acquired by the\nNational Park Service in 1977.\n\n## History\n\nCameras obscura, devices which project an image of the surroundings onto a\nsurface using only existing exterior light sources, usually sunlight, have a\nlong history in San Francisco. The first recorded reference to one in the city\nis from the 1860s in an attraction called Woodward's Gardens. A previous\nincarnation of the Cliff House was noted to have had a camera obscura on its\nfourth floor in 1896. This camera obscura was destroyed when the restaurant\nburned down in 1907. When the third Cliff House reopened in 1937, the owner\nwas approached by businessman Floyd Jennings with the idea of adding a camera\nobscura to the cliffs beside the restaurant. It was installed on the site in\n1946 and has been in continuous operation since then.\n\n## Technology\n\nThe San Francisco Camera Obscura projects an image onto a horizontal viewing\ntable via a reflected image from a viewpoint at the top of the building. A\nmetal hood in the cupola at the top of the building slowly rotates, making a\nfull revolution in about six minutes, allowing for a 360\u00b0 view around the\nbuilding. Light enters the building via an angled mirror in the metal hood. It\nthen passed through a lens with a 150 in. (381 cm) focal length and is\nprojected onto a parabolic white \"table\" in a black room. The origin of the\nlens is uncertain but it appears to have been part of a telescope, likely\nmanufactured by the Clark Lens Company of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n## Preservation\n\nThe Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of Historic Places in\n2001 for its engineering significance. While the exterior of the building was\nextensively modified in 1957 to appear as a giant camera, the internal\nworkings of the camera obscura, the basis of its placement on the Register,\nhave remained unchanged since its erection in 1946. The 1957 external\narchitecture was eligible to be evaluated for historical significance upon\nreaching fifty years of age in 2007.\n\n## See also\n\n  * National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco, California\n  * Sutro Historic District\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  *  \n\n",
      "# The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)\n\nThe Prisoners are fictional characters from the comic book series The Walking\nDead and the television series of the same name.\n\n## Appearances\n\n### Comic book series\n\nDuring Rick's coma, due to the news broadcasts, the inmates and guards had a\nbasic understanding of what was going on. Soon, many of the guards abandoned\nthe prison and the inmates to fend for themselves; at about the same time, a\nfew walkers had somehow gotten inside and began to kill the inmates. Several\nof the guards freed the inmates and joined together to fight their way out,\nresulting in heavy casualties. By the time Rick and his group discovered the\nprison, it was discovered that there were only four survivors left who were\nlocked up inside the cafeteria. The two groups come into conflict after one of\nthem, Thomas Richards, kills two of the survivors, Rachel and Susie Greene,\nHershel Greene's two youngest twin daughters. Dexter is falsely accused of the\ncrime due to him being the \"only\" prisoner who was arrested for murder (it is\nlater revealed that Thomas was arrested for murder as well and initially lied\nabout being arrested for committing tax fraud). Thomas also tries to kill\nAndrea who is left without an earlobe and two scars as well as Patricia. Rick\nsaves Andrea who beats Thomas brutally, and the second attempted murder on\nPatricia's life is stopped by a vengeful Maggie, who empties her entire\nfirearm magazine into Thomas. After Thomas is killed, Dexter and Andrew try to\nkick out Rick's group, resulting in walkers flooding the courtyard. During the\nstruggle, Rick shoots Dexter in the head, covering it up as friendly-fire, and\nAndrew surrenders, running outside the gates to die. Axel, the only prisoner\nto side with Rick, joins the group and later becomes a vital and trusted\nmember of the group until he is killed during the second assault on the Prison\nfrom Woodbury.\n\n### Television series\n\nThe prisoners debut in \"Sick\" where they witness Rick amputating the lower\nportion of Hershel's leg after he is bitten by walkers. Rick makes a deal with\nthe Prisoners to clear out a cell block for them in exchange for half of their\nfood. Tomas brutally Big Tiny after he is scratched by a walker, despite the\nlatter's pleas that he doesn't feel any effects. Tomas tries twice to\nassassinate Rick while clearing out the cells, so Rick kills Tomas with his\nmachete, and chases Andrew and locks him in a courtyard full of walkers. Rick,\nDaryl, and T-Dog hold Axel and Oscar at gunpoint; Axel begs for his life, but\nOscar refuses to beg. Rick's group shows mercy on them and allows them to stay\nin the prison, though he and Oscar are told to stay in another block. Oscar\nand Axel find it very disturbing to stay with their deceased inmates and begs\nRick to let them stay. T-Dog sympathizes with the prisoners and asks Rick to\nlet them join the group, but Rick is adamant about keeping to their earlier\ncompromise. Later, a horde of walkers is let into the prison courtyard,\nresulting in the deaths of T-Dog and Lori. When the prison's sirens sound off,\nOscar explains that the back-up generators are powering the alarms, and takes\nRick to shut them down. Andrew, who survived and is revealed to have let the\nwalkers loose and turned on the alarms, attacks Rick in the generator room.\nOscar kills Andrew, and Oscar and Axel are then allowed to stay with the\nothers. Axel and Oscar helps dig graves for those who died during the walker\nattack. Axel volunteers to go to Woodbury, but stays behind to protect the\nprison. Oscar instead decides to go. During his plan to rescue Glenn Rhee and\nMaggie Greene, members of Rick's group, Oscar is shot dead by a Woodbury\nsoldier. At the prison, Axel soon tries to win the favor of the group by\ntrying to stir up conversations and takes a liking to Beth and Carol, flirting\nwith them both. He is later shown saddened by Oscar's death. Axel, Hershel,\nand Beth, visit new arrivals Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben. He helps the\ngroup fortify the prison, and becomes friendly with Carol by telling her\nstories of his criminal past. He reveals that he was sentenced for trying to\nrob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the police did not believe him and\nfound his brother's gun and assumed it to be the real weapon and he was\nincarcerated. He is killed by The Governor by a shot to the head as part of a\nsurprise attack initiating his assault on the prison.\n\n## Casting and television series reception\n\nAndrew was portrayed by actor and rapper Markice Moore. He had originally\nauditioned for the pilot episode for the role of T-Dog, which went to IronE\nSingleton. Moore was later cast on season 3 as Andrew through his agency:\n\"Production was very hush hush about season 3 so I didn't even know I booked\nit officially until a week before shooting. I was elated; I couldn't believe\nit when my manager, Gail Tassell called to tell me the good news. I'm a huge\nfan of the show, it's my favorite show on TV, so yes it was a dream come\ntrue.\" Per Glen Mazzara, \"Andrew is really Tomas' right-hand man. These guys\nare really the ones who have been intimidating Axel and Oscar.\" Lew Temple was\nalso cast as Axel. He described him as a \"a gregarious Southern redneck-biker\ntype, who has big heart\" and \"a sense of compassion for his fellow man, but he\nis not as meek as he might appear, and though he has had to survive with four\nother hardened criminals, sans Oscar, this brave new world is something\nentirely different for him. He wants to associate and assimilate into the\ngroup of survivors, to the point of trying too hard to be accepted. He has a\nwry sense of humor and ironic quick wit. He will make you laugh and cry in the\nsame offering.\" Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that \"things\nbecome sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew\ninto a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick\ndoes not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a\ngrowing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter\nnoted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea\nof walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that\nthis decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of\nmurder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group\nand forced his own son to put down his mother\". Los Angeles Times columnist\nLaura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open\nthe lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you\nconsider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with\nvendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of Slant Magazine described\nthe episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a\nconspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of\ndisconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene\nends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a\nforeboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden\nstrike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how\nthe episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in\nthe show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode\n\"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking\nlengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan\nSepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it\nhelps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first\nplace. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who\nprobably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the\ngate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for Rolling Stone magazine that\nwhen Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar\nshoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers\nthat Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in\nthe series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I\nloved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people\nwith him! [...] Die Hard TWD fans will remember my character forever because\nof all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick! The fight scenes\nwere great! Especially in my death scene.\" Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club\nin his review of \"Sick\", joked of Oscar and Axel, \"I'm sure the remaining\nprisoners are completely harmless. They said they were harmless\u2014why would they\nlie?\" Showrunner Glen Mazzara commented that in \"Killer Within\", Axel and\nOscar want to be let into the group so they \"prove themselves, which is why\nOscar takes action and kills Andrew (Markice Moore), so that he can gain\naccess to the group. Throughout the entire season, it's a major theme: Who can\nRick let in? Not just into the prison, but let in emotionally.\" Los Angeles\nTimes columnist Laura Hudson observed tribalism as a trope in \"Killer Within\",\nwhich she ascribed to the reluctance of Maggie, Rick, and others in the group\nto allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. Hudson noted that these characters\nhad been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past\ncivilization for so long that they have reverted to \"traveling in a small,\ntightly knit group, hunting and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part\nof their it as a deadly threat.\" Zack Handlen commented in his review of \"Made\nto Suffer\" that \"Axel's enthusiasm for getting laid is sending off all kinds\nof creepy vibes, just the way he got real interested when he found out Beth\nwas 17 could be a bad sign. (His assumption that Carol was a lesbian was kind\nof funny, though.)\" Lew Temple found out about Axel's death about two weeks\nbefore the episode \"Home\" was filmed: \"[Glen Mazzara] had just come down to\nscreen the season 3 premiere episode for cast and crew on location. It was\ngreat! It was a lovely evening. We celebrated an amazing kick-off to a great\nnew season. And that particular night was the first time I had met Glen in\nperson. We had a really nice visit about what we were doing with Axel, and he\nwas so effusive and kind and lovely, saying \"I really dig how you're bringing\nAxel out, and the layers that are there. We can go in so many directions\nbecause you're keeping things close to the vest and we're not sure what he's\nabout.\" So I was fairly excited, and I got a call from his assistant the next\nday saying Glen wanted to speak with me, and I'm like oh, great!, assuming\nhe's going to want to speak more about character development. 15 to 20 seconds\ninto the conversation he says, \"Lew, this is really unfortunate but I've got\nto let you know that Axel is going to take a bullet to the head.\" Eric Goldman\nat IGN thought the death of Axel was a huge surprise. Phil Dyess-Nugent,\nwriting for The A.V. Club, commented that in his earlier appearances, \"Lew\nTemple managed to invest Axel with a certain mangy charm, and he really\nblossoms in this episode; when he's chatting up Carol and shining a little\nwhite-trash charm, I found myself thinking, \"Shit, I'm glad this guy's\naround,\" which is a thought I haven't had about Rick or Glenn or Maggie or\nHershel in living memory. Unfortunately, the show itself seems to share Rick's\ndistrust of letting in strangers.\"\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Ms. Pac-Man\n\nGeneral Computer originally made the game as a modification kit for the\noriginal Pac-Man, titled Crazy Otto. Following legal action with Atari, GCC\nwas forced to present the project to Midway Games, the North American\ndistributor of Pac-Man, before release, who purchased the project. Multiple\nnames were made for the game, including Super Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man and Mrs.\nPac-Man, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. Namco\npresident Masaya Nakamura helped design the character of Ms. Pac-Man, and\ncollected royalties for each arcade cabinet sold. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by\ncritics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist,\nsome labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest\nvideo games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games\never made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and\nhandheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms.\nPac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor\ncompany, Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by\neating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to\nlose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the monsters to\nturn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be\neaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase,\nthe speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the\nmonsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n### Differences from the original Pac-Man\n\n  * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.\n  * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.\n  * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.\n  * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.\n  * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.\n  * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.\n  * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \"she dramatically swoons and falls\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.\n  * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the attract opening sequence for Jr. Pac-Man.\n  * The sound effects and music are all new.\n\n### Fruit point values\n\nAfter level 7, any fruit will appear, although its point value will be the\nsame (unlike in Pac-Man, in which the Key will always be the fruit after level\n13).\n\n## History\n\nMs. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called\nCrazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer\nCorporation (GCC). While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a\nlawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile\nAttack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion\nkits without consent from the original game manufacturer. Rather than\nscrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed\ngame to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become\nimpatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would\nbe Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their\nattention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco\nto prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and\ncharacters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game\nelements were altered to better reflect the Pac-Man series. The game was\ninitially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character.\nInspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female\ncounterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-\nWoman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then\nrealized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby\nto Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their\nrelationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac-Man, and then\nfinally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve\nGolson said \"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super\nPac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all\noccurred within 72 hours of actual production. According to one 1982 estimate,\na majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki\nof Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original\nPac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of\nwomen as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders\nwho have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\" The game was later awarded the\nCertificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982\nArcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular,\nMidway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer\nList of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent,\ncausing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-\nMan was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that\neventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and\nMidway. GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was\nmanufactured without Namco's blessing. Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at\nthat time, helped design the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae\nsaid, \"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the\nPresident of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept,\nget rid of the hair.' Ms. Pac-Man lost her hair\u2013it was actually Pac-Woman at\nthe time, I believe. The beauty mark stayed, and the lips stayed. I think we\nadded a bow, and were quickly done with it, so Ms. Pac-Man had been created.\"\nHowever, Macrae also said, \"At the same time, there was a little bit of\nembarrassment, I believe, in-house in Japan, of the fact that the sequel was\nbeing done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement\nthat Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms.\nPac-Man, being the same as what they got on Pac-Man, and Midway could choose\nto do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\"\n\n## Ports\n\nAtari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and\nAtari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX\nSpectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the\nAtarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all\nfour intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was\npublished to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \"A decent adaptation overall,\nand a good game in its own right.\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man\ngames, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the\narcades, you'll love her here, too.\"\n\n## Intellectual rights\n\nThe GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway Games in 1982, as\nat the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from\nNamco. In the years since, the Ms. Pac-Man license fell back to Namco (now\nBandai Namco) after Midway went bankrupt in 2010. Around 2019, AtGames, a\ncompany that specializes in microconsoles feature retro arcade hits, had\napproached the GCC group members about licensing Ms. Pac-Man. AtGames had\nlearned that while some of the ongoing royalties for the Ms. Pac-Man were\nbeing met by Bandai Namco, they were not meeting all the terms. Bandai Namco,\non learning that AtGames has been seeking these rights for a possible mini-\narcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames, declaring that AtGames was\nviolating Bandai Namco's control of the license.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that the Genesis version of Ms.\nPac-Man, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling\nGenesis games. The same year, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as\nnumber 12 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying that it has aged far\nbetter than the original Pac-Man due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes,\nmoving fruits, and intermissions. They added, \"It has the broadest appeal of\nany game Next Generation has seen, with the possible exception of Tetris.\nWomen love it. Men Love it. Children love it.\" In 2009, Game Informer put Ms.\nPac-Man 10th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it\n\"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\". This is down one rank\nfrom Game Informers previous best games of all-time list. Entertainment Weekly\ncalled Ms. Pac-Man one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In\n2016, Ms. Pac-Man placed 5th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time\nlist.\n\n### Re-releases\n\n  * In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man included in a CD-i Arcade Classics collection (released in Europe, but not in North America). It had all of the extra features of Tengen's ports even though neither Tengen nor Williams Electronics had made this version.\n  * It is included in Namco's, Microsoft's and Atari's late 1990s series of classic game anthologies, and is an unlockable minigame in the SNES version of and in Pac-Man World 2.\n  * A standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. Ms. Pac-Man and four other games (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious and Pole Position) are included in a self-contained joystick hand controller.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was also a free game bundled with every Xbox Live Arcade disc for the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 XBLA version was released on January 9, 2007, featuring an online leaderboard and twelve achievements.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was later released on Namco Museum Volume 3; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all Namco Museum releases).\n  * As of July 11, 2008, Ms. Pac Man is available for Apple's iPhone through the App Store. The game was also released in July for Windows Mobile.\n  * As part of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, Ms. Pac-Man is one of the games included on the home version of Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine.\n  * It was included as downloadable content in Pac-Man Museum for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Ms. Pac-Man at the Arcade History database\n  * Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 at Atari Mania\n  * GCC 2004 reunion audio Presentation by GCC alumni of their company history, including development of Ms. Pac-Man\n  * Twin Galaxies has a scoreboard for Ms. Pac-Man high scores (registration required)\n\n"

Namco\npresident Masaya Nakamura helped design the character of Ms. Pac-Man, and\ncollected royalties for each arcade cabinet sold. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by\ncritics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist,\nsome labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest\nvideo games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games\never made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and\nhandheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms.\nPac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor\ncompany, Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by\neating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to\nlose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the monsters to\nturn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be\neaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase,\nthe speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the\nmonsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n### Differences from the original Pac-Man\n\n  * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.\n  * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.\n  * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.\n  * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.\n  * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.\n  * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.\n  * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \"she dramatically swoons and falls\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.\n  * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the attract opening sequence for Jr. Pac-Man.\n  * The sound effects and music are all new.\n\n### Fruit point values\n\nAfter level 7, any fruit will appear, although its point value will be the\nsame (unlike in Pac-Man, in which the Key will always be the fruit after level\n13).\n\n## History\n\nMs. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called\nCrazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer\nCorporation (GCC). While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a\nlawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile\nAttack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion\nkits without consent from the original game manufacturer. Rather than\nscrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed\ngame to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become\nimpatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would\nbe Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their\nattention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco\nto prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and\ncharacters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game\nelements were altered to better reflect the Pac-Man series. The game was\ninitially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character.\nInspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female\ncounterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-\nWoman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then\nrealized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby\nto Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their\nrelationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac-Man, and then\nfinally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve\nGolson said \"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super\nPac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all\noccurred within 72 hours of actual production. According to one 1982 estimate,\na majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki\nof Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original\nPac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of\nwomen as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders\nwho have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\" The game was later awarded the\nCertificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982\nArcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular,\nMidway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer\nList of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent,\ncausing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-\nMan was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that\neventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and\nMidway. GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was\nmanufactured without Namco's blessing. Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at\nthat time, helped design the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae\nsaid, \"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the\nPresident of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept,\nget rid of the hair.' Ms. Pac-Man lost her hair\u2013it was actually Pac-Woman at\nthe time, I believe. The beauty mark stayed, and the lips stayed. I think we\nadded a bow, and were quickly done with it, so Ms. Pac-Man had been created.\"\nHowever, Macrae also said, \"At the same time, there was a little bit of\nembarrassment, I believe, in-house in Japan, of the fact that the sequel was\nbeing done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement\nthat Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms.\nPac-Man, being the same as what they got on Pac-Man, and Midway could choose\nto do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\"\n\n## Ports\n\nAtari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and\nAtari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX\nSpectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the\nAtarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all\nfour intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of\nPac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-\nMan had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in\n1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was\ncontrolled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum\nfluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at\nthe 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation\nreleased a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth\nintermissions, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.\nTengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo\nEntertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-\nMan in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in\nJapan. The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super\nNES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four\ndifferent sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller\nmazes, and \"strange\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let\nplayers make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the\noriginal arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two\npeople to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at\nlevel 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It\nwas released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super\nPac-Man).\n\n### Reception\n\nIn January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the\nYear award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated\nthat Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-\nselling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than\none million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version,\nthree of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is\ntimeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The\nfourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity\nof Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original\ngame but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat\nfrustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super\nNES in the form of an unlockable in . In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the\nLynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and\nfound the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed\nthe Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \"it offers a fun and non-\nviolent challenge which will appeal to anyone\" giving a final score of 79 out\nof 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he\nliked the \"neat little between-level scenes\" and the \"jolly title tune\" giving\na final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was\npublished to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \"A decent adaptation overall,\nand a good game in its own right.\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man\ngames, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the\narcades, you'll love her here, too.\"\n\n## Intellectual rights\n\nThe GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway Games in 1982, as\nat the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from\nNamco. In the years since, the Ms. Pac-Man license fell back to Namco (now\nBandai Namco) after Midway went bankrupt in 2010. Around 2019, AtGames, a\ncompany that specializes in microconsoles feature retro arcade hits, had\napproached the GCC group members about licensing Ms. Pac-Man. AtGames had\nlearned that while some of the ongoing royalties for the Ms. Pac-Man were\nbeing met by Bandai Namco, they were not meeting all the terms. Bandai Namco,\non learning that AtGames has been seeking these rights for a possible mini-\narcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames, declaring that AtGames was\nviolating Bandai Namco's control of the license.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that the Genesis version of Ms.\nPac-Man, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling\nGenesis games. The same year, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as\nnumber 12 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying that it has aged far\nbetter than the original Pac-Man due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes,\nmoving fruits, and intermissions. They added, \"It has the broadest appeal of\nany game Next Generation has seen, with the possible exception of Tetris.\nWomen love it. Men Love it. Children love it.\" In 2009, Game Informer put Ms.\nPac-Man 10th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it\n\"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\". This is down one rank\nfrom Game Informers previous best games of all-time list. Entertainment Weekly\ncalled Ms. Pac-Man one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In\n2016, Ms. Pac-Man placed 5th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time\nlist.\n\n### Re-releases\n\n  * In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man included in a CD-i Arcade Classics collection (released in Europe, but not in North America). It had all of the extra features of Tengen's ports even though neither Tengen nor Williams Electronics had made this version.\n  * It is included in Namco's, Microsoft's and Atari's late 1990s series of classic game anthologies, and is an unlockable minigame in the SNES version of and in Pac-Man World 2.\n  * A standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. Ms. Pac-Man and four other games (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious and Pole Position) are included in a self-contained joystick hand controller.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was also a free game bundled with every Xbox Live Arcade disc for the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 XBLA version was released on January 9, 2007, featuring an online leaderboard and twelve achievements.\n  * Ms. Pac-Man was later released on Namco Museum Volume 3; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all Namco Museum releases).\n  * As of July 11, 2008, Ms. Pac Man is available for Apple's iPhone through the App Store. The game was also released in July for Windows Mobile.\n  * As part of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, Ms. Pac-Man is one of the games included on the home version of Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine.\n  * It was included as downloadable content in Pac-Man Museum for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360.\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Ms. Pac-Man at the Arcade History database\n  * Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 at Atari Mania\n  * GCC 2004 reunion audio Presentation by GCC alumni of their company history, including development of Ms. Pac-Man\n  * Twin Galaxies has a scoreboard for Ms. Pac-Man high scores (registration required)\n\n"

      "# Alex Campbell (golfer)\n\nAlexander Campbell (28 November 1876 \u2013 16 December 1942) was a Scottish\nprofessional golfer and golf course architect of the late 19th and early 20th\ncentury. In total, Campbell had five top-10 finishes in major championships.\n\n## Early life\n\nAlex/Alec \"Nipper\" Campbell was born in Scotland on 28 November 1876, the son\nof Alexander Campbell and Margaret Campbell n\u00e9e Patterson. He had five\nbrothers who also became golf professionals.\n\n## Golf career\n\nCampbell was the head professional at several golf clubs, including The\nCountry Club (Brookline, Massachusetts, 1896\u20131916), Baltimore Country Club\n(Baltimore, Maryland), Northmoor Golf Club (Celina, Ohio), Losantiville\nCountry Club (Cincinnati, Ohio), Miami Valley Golf Club and Moraine Country\nClub (Dayton, Ohio). He was also a golf course architect, designing the\nMoraine Country Club. In 1913, at The Country Club, he played a friendly match\nagainst Wilfrid Reid upon the Englishman's arrival in Boston to play in the\n1913 U.S. Open. During his 20-year career at The Country Club, he was involved\nin the development of caddy Francis Ouimet as a player.\n\n### 1901 U.S. Open\n\nCampbell finished in eighth place in the 1901 U.S. Open at Myopia Hunt Club.\nWillie Anderson won his first of four U.S. Open titles in a playoff over Alex\nSmith.

      "# World Golf Championships\n\nThe World Golf Championships (WGC) are a group of four annual events for\nprofessional golfers created by the International Federation of PGA Tours. All\nfour WGC tournaments are official money events on the PGA Tour and the\nEuropean Tour, and officially sanctioned by the Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour,\nSunshine Tour, and PGA Tour of Australasia. All four WGC events offer\ncomparable prize money to the major championships. In the pantheon of golf\nevents, some rank WGCs immediately below the major championships and above all\nother competitions; however, others would put The Players Championship, the\nso-called \"Fifth Major\", above WGC events. The winner of a WGC event earns a\nthree-year PGA Tour exemption.\n\n## Events\n\nThe first three events all began in 1999, although the WGC Invitational is the\ndirect successor of the World Series of Golf, which began in 1976 and the WGC\nMatch Play Championship is a direct successor to the Andersen Consulting World\nChampionship of Golf which began in 1995. The WGC-Mexico Championship\noriginally traveled to different venues around the world. After 2006 it\nsuperseded the Doral Open, a long-standing event at the Doral Resort in\nFlorida. The HSBC Champions, first held in 2005, was awarded World Golf\nChampionships status starting with the 2009 edition. It is now the fourth\ntournament on the worldwide calendar. In April 2011, the Sunshine Tour\nannounced that it would host a fifth WGC event. The event, to be known as the\nTournament of Hope, was to be linked to awareness of poverty and HIV/AIDS in\nAfrica. In early 2012 it was announced that the tournament would be played in\n2013; later in 2012 it was announced that the tournament would not be a WGC\nevent, but ultimately the tournament never took place. The WGC concept was\nintroduced to create a larger group of golf tournaments with a high global\nprofile by bringing the leading golfers from different tours together on a\nmore regular basis, rather than just for the major championships. At the time\nthe publicity spoke of a \"World Tour\" which might develop on the basis of the\nWorld Championships and the majors. The \"World Tour\" concept seems to have\nbeen dropped, but the four events usually attract almost all of the elite\nplayers who are eligible to compete and they rank among the most prestigious\nand high-profile events outside of the majors. The prize money on offer is\nvery close to being the highest for any professional golf tournament. Winners\ngenerally receive 70 to 78 Official World Golf Rankings points, the most\nawarded for any tournament apart from the major championships, which carry 100\npoints, and The Players Championship, which is allocated 80. Tiger Woods has\ndominated these tournaments, winning 16 of the first 32 individual (non-World\nCup) events and winning at least one event each year from 1999 to 2009. From\n2000 to 2006 the men's golf World Cup, a tournament for teams of two players\nrepresenting their country, was a World Golf Championship event, although it\nwas not an official money event on any tour. Beginning in 2007 it is no longer\npart of the World Golf Championships, but it is still played, and is currently\nknown as the Mission Hills World Cup. Also from 2000 to 2006, two or three of\nthe four events were staged in the United States in most of the years, and one\nor two were staged elsewhere. Starting in 2007, all three of the individual\nWorld Golf Championships events were played in the United States, which\nattracted criticism from some golfers, including Tiger Woods and Ernie Els,\nand in the media outside the United States. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem\nresponded by insisting that playing in the U.S is best for golf as more money\ncan be made there than elsewhere. This criticism has been muted since the 2009\nelevation of the HSBC Champions, held in China, to full WGC status. In\naddition, the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017 marked the move of half the WGC\nevents to outside the United States. The winners receive Wedgwood trophies\nnamed for a golf legend. The HSBC Champions features The Old Tom Morris Cup;\nthe Dell Match Play Championship, The Walter Hagen Cup; the Mexico\nChampionship, The Gene Sarazen Cup; and the Bridgestone Invitational, The Gary\nPlayer Cup.\n\n## Winners\n\nThe 2016 Invitational was not co-sanctioned with the European Tour.\n\n## Multiple winners\n\nDustin Johnson is the only player to win all four individual WGCs. Tiger\nWoods' 18 WGC victories dwarfs his nearest rival, Johnson, with six. Although\nnot counting as individual wins, Woods also won the then WGC-World Cup with\nthe United States, and 2-time WGC winner Ernie Els won the same competition\nwith South Africa.\n\n  * Note: The World Cup did not count as individual wins, so it is not mentioned here as a part of this table.\n\n## National summary\n\n## Notes and references\n\n## External links\n\n  * Official site\n\n",
      "# List of The Open Championship venues\n\nThe Open Championship is an annual golf competition established in 1860, and\nconducted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (the R&A;). It is\nplayed on the weekend of the third Friday in July, and is the last of the four\nmajor championships to be played each year. The championship is currently held\non a different course each year. Of the 14 that have been used, 10 are\ncurrently used in the rota. All the courses on the rota are links courses.\nPrestwick Golf Club hosted the first championship in 1860 and remained the\nsole venue until 1873, when the Old Course at St Andrews hosted the event.\nPrestwick hosted a further 12 championships, the last in 1925. Musselburgh\nLinks became the third course to host the championship in 1874. The three\ncourses rotated the hosting of the championship until 1892 when Muirfield\nhosted the event. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers built their own\ncourse at Muirfield and Musselburgh was removed from the rota as a result.\nRoyal St George's Golf Club became the first course outside Scotland to host\nthe championship in 1894. Royal Liverpool Golf Club hosted the event for the\nfirst time in 1897. Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club became the next course to\nhost the event in 1909. The course hosted a further championship in 1920, but\nfurther attempts to host the Championship in 1938 and 1949 were thwarted by\nbad weather and the course was dropped from the rota. Royal Troon, Royal\nLytham & St Annes and Carnoustie held the Open Championship for the first time\nin 1923, 1926 and 1931 respectively. The following year Prince's Golf Club\nhosted the event for the only time. The course was requisitioned by the\nmilitary during the Second World War and was extensively damaged. Royal\nBirkdale was chosen as the host course in 1940, however, due to the Second\nWorld War the event did not go ahead. It was not until 1954 that Royal\nBirkdale hosted the Open. The Old Course at St Andrews has hosted the most\nchampionships with 29 in total, most recently with the 2015 Open Championship.\nThe championship has been held outside Scotland and England twice, in 1951 and\n2019; Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland was the venue for both\ntournaments.

      "# Ireland at the Rugby World Cup\n\nThe Ireland national rugby union team have played all eight Rugby World Cup\ntournaments. They have played in the quarter-finals at all but two\ntournaments, but have yet to progress to the semi-finals. They have finished\ntop of their pool twice. Ireland has never played either South Africa or\nEngland in a World Cup match. Ireland has competed at every Rugby World Cup\nsince the tournament was first held in Australia and New Zealand in 1987.\n\n## Summary\n\nAfter a loss to Wales, Ireland finished second in their pool in 1987 but were\nthen knocked out by Australia in their quarter final in Sydney. In 1991\nIreland again lost only the one match in pool play (to Scotland). They again\nmet the Australians in the quarter-finals, who defeated them by one point.\nRunner-up in their pool in 1995 to New Zealand, Ireland were defeated by\nFrance in their quarter-final in Durban. Ireland finished second in their pool\nin 1999, behind Australia and went into the quarter-final play-offs (a system\nexclusive to the 1999 tournament). There they lost to Argentina, and thus, not\nbeing quarter-finalists, they were not given automatic entry into 2003. They\ndefeated Russia and Georgia to go through the 2003 World Cup as Europe 1. They\nfinished second to Australia in their pool, and were knocked out by France in\nthe quarter finals. They started in the so-called \"Group of death\" with hosts\nFrance, Argentina, Namibia and Georgia in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They\nplayed Namibia (the lowest ranked team in the World cup) in their opening game\non 9 September which resulted in a narrow 32\u201317 win. Their progress was then\nput into doubt when they beat Georgia 14\u201310, not obtaining a bonus point.\nFrance's victory over Namibia 87\u201310 put Ireland's progression from the group\nin doubt, and this was compounded when the French defeated Ireland 25\u20133.\nEntering their last group match against Argentina, needing four tries to\nsecure a bonus point without allowing Argentina anything, Ireland were\ndefeated by 30 points to 15 and crashed out at the pool stage for the first\ntime. Ireland began their 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign on the back of four\ndefeats in a series of warm-up tests in August, with a 22\u201310 victory over the\nUnited States in New Plymouth on 11 September. Failing to secure a bonus point\nagainst world cup minnows the United States, a team ranked far below Ireland,\nthis was an unconvincing win. Contrary to preceding form, and indeed beating\nmost commentators expectations, Ireland produced a memorable performance to\ndefeat reigning tri-nations champions Australia 15\u20136 in their second pool game\nin Eden Park in Auckland on 17 September. This was the first Irish win against\ntri-nations opposition in the southern hemisphere in 32 years. It was also\nIreland's first ever win against Australia in the Rugby World Cup. After\ncomprehensive wins against Russia and Italy in the final two pool-stage\nmatches, Ireland topped Pool C. This was the first ever time Ireland came\nfirst in a world cup pool. Ireland advanced to the quarter-finals to face\nWales in Wellington. They were defeated 22\u201310 by the Welsh, thus ending their\n2011 campaign. Ireland topped Pool D of the 2015 Rugby World Cup with four\nvictories and with two bonus points. Ireland beat Canada and Romania with\nbonus points in their first two games. Ireland then faced Italy, coming out on\ntop 16\u20139, the only try coming from Keith Earls who surpassed Brian O'Driscoll\nas Ireland's leading Rugby World Cup try scorer with eight. The final pool\ngame saw Ireland face France. The winner would set up a quarter final against\nArgentina and avoid the All Blacks. Ireland overcame the loss to injury of key\nplayers Jonathan Sexton, Peter O'Mahony and Paul O'Connell to run out 24\u20139\nwinners. The victory set up another game for Ireland in the Millennium Stadium\nagainst Pool C runners up Argentina on 18 October 2015. Ireland battled and\ncame back from a 17-point deficit to come within 3 points of their opponents,\nbut eventually lost 43\u201320. At the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Ireland began with a\n27-3 win against Scotland on 22 September before losing to Japan a week later\n19-12 in the Shizuoka Stadium. Wins over Russia by 35-0 and Samoa by 47-5\nsetup a quarter-final against New Zealand on 19 October. In Joe Schmidt's last\ngame in charge, New Zealand won easily by 46-14 to eliminate Ireland form the\nWorld Cup at the quarter-final stage for the seventh time.\n\n## By position\n\n## Matches\n\n### 1987 Rugby World Cup\n\nPool 2 matches \u2013 Quarter-final\n\n### 1991 Rugby World Cup\n\nPool 2 matches \u2013 Quarter-final\n\n### 1995 Rugby World Cup\n\nPool C matches \u2013 Quarter finals \u2013\n\n### 1999 Rugby World Cup\n\nPool E matches \u2013 Quarter-final play off\n\n### 2003 Rugby World Cup\n\nGroup A matches \u2013\n\n### 2007 Rugby World Cup\n\nPool D matches \u2013\n\n### 2011 Rugby World Cup\n\nIreland qualified for the 2011 RWC automatically.

Pool A, which England was in, saw\nmatches played mostly in London, though games were also taken to Leicester,\nGloucester and Otley. Pool B games, which involved European nations, Scotland\nand Ireland, had all their games in either Dublin or Edinburgh with one game\nbeing played in Belfast.

All Pool A games were held in Scotland, Pool B\ngames in England, Pool C games in France and Pool D games were all held in\nWales.

      "# List of FIFA World Cup finals\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition\nestablished in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the\nmembers of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the\nsport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four\nyears, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to\nWorld War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by\nFrance, who beat Croatia 4\u20132 in regulation time. The World Cup final match is\nthe last of the competition, and the result determines which country is\ndeclared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a\ndraw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If\nsuch a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty\nshoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.\nThe tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except\n1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group\ncontested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2\u20131\nvictory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of\nthe tournament) that put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished\ntop of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA\nas the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup. In the 21 tournaments held, 79\nnations have appeared at least once. Of these, 13 have made it to the final\nmatch, and eight have won. With five titles, Brazil is the most successful\nWorld Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World\nCup finals tournament. Italy and Germany have four titles. Current champion\nFrance, along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina, have two titles each,\nwhile England and Spain have one each. The team that wins the finals receive\nthe FIFA World Cup Trophy, and their name is engraved on the bottom side of\nthe trophy. The 1970 and 1994, along with the 1986, 1990, and 2014 games are\nto date the only matches competed by the same teams (Brazil\u2013Italy and\nArgentina\u2013Germany respectively). As of 2018, the 1934 final remains the latest\nfinal to have been between two teams playing their first final. The final\nmatch of the most recent tournament in Russia took place at the country's\nbiggest sports complex, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The 1930 and the 1966\ngames are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday. The former did on\na Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday. As of 2018, only nations from Europe\nand South America have competed in a World Cup final. Six nations have won the\nfinal as host: Uruguay, Italy, England, Germany, Argentina, and France.

      "# Shot heard round the world (soccer)\n\nThe \"Shot heard round the world\" is a term used in reference to one of the\nmost historic goals in U.S. soccer history, which allowed the U.S. national\nteam to make it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup after 36 years of failed attempts\nto qualify. This goal was scored in the qualification game between United\nStates and Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989 in Port of Spain. The U.S.\nteam had not qualified for a FIFA World Cup since 1950, and the U.S. (having\nbeing selected by FIFA in 1988 to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup) wanted to give\na good impression to the world of soccer by qualifying to the 1990 World Cup.\n\n## Background\n\nThe United States was one of the five nations competing in the final round of\nCONCACAF's qualifiers for two spots at the upcoming World Cup in Italy, the\nother involved nations being Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Trinidad &\nTobago. Mexico was disqualified due to a scandal related with the age\nadulteration for a youth tournament, known as los cachirules. In that time,\nthe U.S. team was formed mainly by college and semi-professional players. They\nstarted by losing 1\u20130 to Costa Rica, then they got revenge by beating Costa\nRica 1\u20130, tied 1\u20131 against Trinidad and Tobago, won 2\u20131 against Guatemala and\nwon 1\u20130 against El Salvador. After scoreless draws against both Guatemala and\nEl Salvador, the situation of the group was as follows: The United States\nneeded a win in order to qualify for the World Cup because a loss or a draw\nwould allow Trinidad and Tobago to qualify. Costa Rica had already\nmathematically qualified for the tournament in Italy.\n\n## Match\n\nThe game was played on November 19, 1989 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium in\nPort of Spain. The stadium was painted red, as an homage to the Strike Squad\nas the Trinidad and Tobago team was then known as. In the first minutes, John\nHarkes tried unsuccessfully to score. Trinidad and Tobago's Elliot Allen had\ntwo attempts on goal. At the 30th minute, Bruce Murray passed the ball to Paul\nCaligiuri, who dodged a rival defender and with a left-footed shot scored 1\u20130\nfor the United States. Trinidadian goalkeeper Michael Maurice waited for the\nball practically standing on the goal-line, but he couldn't see it, arguing\nthat the sun had blinded him. In the second half, the Trinidadian team went\ninto attack in order to get a draw, but their efforts were in vain, as\nAmerican goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to stop Trinidad and Tobago's\nattempts. After the final whistle, the U.S. celebrated the victory while\nTrinidad and Tobago was left in consternation.\n\n### Details\n\n## Post-match\n\nAfter game, the group results were as follows: Due to the political situation\nin El Salvador and the fact that El Salvador and Guatemala had no chances to\nqualify for the World Cup, the matches still to be played between El Salvador\nand Guatemala were cancelled. The U.S. press, considering the significance of\nthe result, described Caligiuri's goal as \"the shot heard 'round the world\".\nAfter 36 years of absences from the World Cup, the U.S. team qualified for the\n1990 World Cup but its participation in the tournament was brief. They lost\n1\u20135 to Czechoslovakia, 0\u20131 against hosts Italy, and 1\u20132 against Austria. The\nU.S. would consecutively qualify for the next six subsequent World Cups, and\ncouldn't keep the streak going until 2018, because they lost 2\u20131 to Trinidad\nand Tobago during their final qualification game. Trinidad and Tobago suffered\na protracted crisis of confidence until their own World Cup dream finally came\ntrue in 2005, after beating Bahrain 2\u20131 on aggregate in an intercontinental\nplay-off, which allowed the Soca Warriors to qualify to the 2006 FIFA World\nCup in Germany. Yorke and Latapy (survivors of the qualifying campaign of\n1989) were part of that Trinidadian team, which in that World Cup drew against\nSweden 0\u20130 and lost against England 2\u20130 and Paraguay 2\u20130, being eliminated in\nthe first round.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20131 United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n"

      "# Sign of the Times (Harry Styles song)\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" is the debut single by English singer-songwriter Harry\nStyles from his self-titled debut studio album. Released on 7 April 2017 by\nColumbia Records, it was written by Styles, Jeff Bhasker, Mitch Rowland, Ryan\nNasci, Alex Salibian, and Tyler Johnson, and produced by Bhasker, Salibian,\nand Johnson. Musically, it was described by critics as a pop rock and soft\nrock ballad. Its accompanying music video was released on 8 May.\n\n## Background and release\n\nRumours about Styles embarking on a solo career sparked in 2015, when it was\nreported that Sony Music wanted Styles to release a solo album during . By the\nend of 2015, four new songs written and performed by Styles were registered on\nthe ASCAP online database, which was believed to be for his potential debut\nsolo album at the time. Shortly after, Styles signed with American agent\nJeffrey Azoff and inked a record contract with Columbia Records. In September\n2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man, which led to media\nspeculation about a new album on the horizon. In February 2017, the CEO of\nColumbia Records, Rob Stringer, revealed that the album was close to being\nfinished and called it \"authentic\". A month later, it was reported that the\nalbum sounded like David Bowie and Queen, and was later revealed to have been\nexecutively produced by Grammy award-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye\nWest, Fun, Mark Ronson). The same report also hinted that the lead single\nwould be released in late April or early May and sounded \"like it would be a\nsmash in any decade\". The same month, US radio host Elvis Duran accidentally\nrevealed during his show that Styles' debut single would be released on 7\nApril 2017. On 25 March, Styles teased the new single with a television ad\nduring The Voice UK. On 31 March, the singer revealed through social media\nthat his single is titled \"Sign of the Times\". On 7 April, the song premiered\nduring Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show on BBC Radio 1.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe song is a pop rock, soft rock, piano ballad, with glam rock influences.\nAccording to Billboard, it \"folds in psychedelic soul, indie rock and spacey\npop\". The \"apocalyptic\" power ballad shows influences from 70s British rock.\nThe track was co-written by Jeff Bhasker, Alex Salibian and Tyler Johnson.\nAlso credited were Mitch Rowland, Ryan Nasci, and Styles (who received the top\ncredit). Rowland played guitar and drums, Nasci the bass, and Bhasker the\npiano, keyboard and lap steel parts. A 25 voice choir provided harmonies\nthroughout the song. The track was recorded at Village Studios in Los Angeles\nand Geejam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and was mixed by\nSpike Stent. \"Sign of the Times\" is composed in the key of F major and set in\na 4/4 time signature at a moderately slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. The\nidea of the song was conceived by Styles while playing chords on the piano in\nJamaica. Styles explained to Rolling Stone that \"The song is written from a\npoint of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there's a\ncomplication. The mother is told, 'The child is fine, but you're not going to\nmake it.' The mother has five minutes to tell the child, 'Go forth and\nconquer.'\" The entire song was cut in three hours according to Bhasker, who\ncalled it \"an instant classic-sounding record from conception to completion\".\n\n## Music video\n\nDirected by Yoann Lemoine, the song's music video was released on 8 May 2017.\nIt features Styles singing in a meadow, flying in the skies, and walking on\nwater. A writer from USA Today humorously described Styles as \"auditioning to\nbe Marvel Comics next superhero or in a new biblical epic\". It was filmed on\nthe Isle of Skye in Scotland. The video's stunt pilot, Will Banks, stated that\nStyles flew more than 1,550 feet high during the shoot. Banks also claimed\nthat no green screen or CGI effects were employed during filming. A stunt\ndouble was used for some scenes. The music video won British Artist Video of\nthe Year at the 2018 Brit Awards and Best Music Video at the 2018 iHeartRadio\nMusic Awards. It was nominated for two awards at the 2017 MTV Video Music\nAwards: Best Pop Video and Best Visual Effects. , it has received more than\n510 million views on YouTube.\n\n## Accolades\n\n## Critical reception\n\nBillboards Gil Kaufman wrote, \"Every artist is an accumulation of their\ninfluences, and in [this song] they come fast and furious, as Styles appears\nto be both showing his range and making a clear effort to step boldly away\nfrom the manufactured, plastic pop of his past\". Kaufman opined it \"rakes in\ninfluences from Pink Floyd and David Bowie to Queen, Spacehog, Suede,\nColdplay, The Beatles, Eric Carmen and Prince\". Also for Billboard, Jason\nLipshutz wrote it is \"resolute, determined, wholly committed to its messaging\nand sound, radio trends be damned. Although it wears its influences on its\nsleeve (Bowie) nothing about this single bends toward someone else's\nexpectations\". He concluded saying the song \"sounds effortless, but to arrive\nwithout any incomplete features is an accomplishment in a music industry where\npop artists are expected to produce new music at an unsustainable rate\". Tim\nJonze of The Guardian described it as \"a ballad, but not so much in the\nboyband style\" and compared the song to the music of American indie rock band\nThe Walkmen. Jonze also addressed early rumours that the song would be\ninfluenced by the music of David Bowie, noting, \"If it is indeed Bowie-esque,\nthen it's the Bowie of Hunky Dory\". Jamieson Cox writing for Pitchfork felt\nthe \"sky-scraping Bowie ballad\" manages to sound like both Fun's \"We Are\nYoung\" and Coldplay's \"The Scientist\". NPR's Ann Powers argued the song\nmirrors more closely \"Britpop anthems\" like Blur's \"Tender\" or The Verve's\n\"Bittersweet Symphony\" \"than anything Bowie released in his prime\". Brittany\nSpanos of Rolling Stone thought it \"aligns much more with the Seventies-\ninspired pop-rock of One Direction's more recent albums like Made in the\nA.M.\". Anjali Raguraman from The Straits Times considered it the \"strongest\"\ntrack on the album, saying \"the conviction of his delivery is beyond his\nyears\". In The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber opined that the song \"continues\nwith One Direction's po-mo project of recycling classic-rock sounds as\nbubblegum. But he's now embracing such sounds with more abandon, less\nchirpiness, some trend bucking, and the kind of uplifting lyrics that nod to\nplanetary anxiety\". Kornhaber described the song opens with ballad piano,\n\"encroaching\" violins, and Styles \"crooning in pain\", \"but then there's the\nbwang of a guitar and the song rockets into an arena-rock reverie that feels\nso, so familiar to anyone who remembers the '90s but also so, so foreign to\ntoday's landscape\". Since it was released on the 30th anniversary of Prince's\nSign o' the Times, Spins Andy Cush commented, \"it's clear that this is\nStyles's attempt to distinguish himself as an artist with real depth. But the\nmusic itself has almost nothing to do with Prince\u2013instead, think Oasis, Elton\nJohn at his most bombastic, '70s John Lennon\". Cush noted it \"has only those\nthree chords, and it goes straight for cruising altitude with an onslaught of\ncymbals and guitar on the first chorus, expecting you to be moved without\npausing to consider why\". Billboards critics' list placed it first on \"Every\nOne Direction Solo Single, Ranked\" in May 2017, stating that \"[the song]\nspends six minutes climbing its way skyward and just keeps going once it gets\nthere, not ostentatious so much as naturally weightless, the first One\nDirection solo single to truly achieve escape velocity from the group's\ngravitational pull.\" Rolling Stone ranked it as the best song released in\n2017. Billboard staff considered it the 8th best song of the year and best\nrock song of the year. Pitchfork ranked it as the 87th best song of 2017. Spin\nstaff ranked it as the 13th best boy-band solo debut single. In 2018, Rolling\nStone ranked it 49th among the 100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Far.\n\n## Commercial performance\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with a combined\nsales of 62,900 units. In its first week, it recorded 39,000 digital downloads\ncombined with 3.5 million streams that give 23,472 equivalent units, ending Ed\nSheeran's run of 13 consecutive weeks at the top of the chart with \"Shape of\nYou\".

It ranked number nine on the Most Shazamed Songs of 2017.\n\"Sign of the Times\" managed to be on the Shazam's Hall of Fame, the most\nShazamed songs of all time at 100th.\n\n## Cover versions and usage in media\n\nKygo and Ellie Goulding performed a cover of the song on BBC Radio 1's Live\nLounge. Hanson performed a cover on KIIS 106.5. Paul Cardall made a classical\ncover of the song.

      "# In the Heat of the Night (film)\n\nIn the Heat of the Night is a 1967 American mystery drama film directed by\nNorman Jewison. It is based on John Ball's 1965 novel of the same name and\ntells the story of Virgil Tibbs, a black police detective from Philadelphia,\nwho becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in Mississippi.\nIt stars Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, and was produced by Walter Mirisch.\nThe screenplay was by Stirling Silliphant. The film won five Academy Awards,\nincluding the 1967 awards for Best Picture and Rod Steiger for Best Actor. The\nfilm was followed by two sequels, They Call Me Mister Tibbs! in 1970, and The\nOrganization in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a television series\nadaptation of the same name. Although the film was set in the fictional\nMississippi town of Sparta (with supposedly no connection to the real Sparta,\nMississippi), most of the movie was filmed in Sparta, Illinois, where many of\nthe film's landmarks can still be seen. The quote \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\nwas listed as number 16 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movie\nQuotes, a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for\npreservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of\nCongress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from Chicago\nto Sparta, Mississippi, to build a factory there. Late one night, police\nofficer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body lying in the street. Chief\nGillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been\ndead for a few hours. Wood, sent by the chief to check out various town access\nand exit points, finds a black man, Virgil Tibbs, at the train station and\narrests him. Gillespie accuses Tibbs of the murder, and is embarrassed to\nlearn Tibbs is a police officer from Philadelphia. Gillespie phones Tibbs's\nchief, who informs Gillespie that Tibbs is a top homicide detective and\nrecommends that he should assist the investigation. The idea does not appeal\nto either Gillespie or Tibbs, but for reasons of their own they reluctantly\nagree. Tibbs examines Colbert's body and concludes the murder happened earlier\nthan the doctor had estimated, that the killer was right-handed, and that the\nbody had been killed elsewhere and then moved to where it was found. Gillespie\narrests another suspect, Harvey Oberst, who protests his innocence. The police\nare planning to beat a confession out of him, until Tibbs learns Oberst is\nleft-handed and has an alibi backed up by witnesses, which clears him of the\nmurder. The victim's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the police and\nimpressed by Tibbs. She threatens to halt construction of the factory unless\nTibbs leads the investigation, and the town's leading citizens are forced to\ngo along with her wish. The two policemen begin to respect each other as they\nare forced to work together. Tibbs initially suspects plantation owner\nEndicott, a genteel racist and one of the most powerful individuals in town,\nwho publicly opposed the new factory. When Tibbs interrogates Endicott,\nEndicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang\nof hooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues Tibbs and tells him to leave town\nfor his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case and take Endicott\ndown. Gillespie points out to Tibbs how bitter he has become. Tibbs asks Wood\nto re-trace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie\njoins them. When they arrive at an all-night restaurant, Ralph, working behind\nthe counter, refuses to serve Tibbs. Later, when Tibbs asks Wood why he\nchanged his route, Gillespie starts suspecting Wood. Gillespie discovers that\nWood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder.\nGillespie arrests Wood despite Tibbs's protests. Purdy, a nasty local, brings\nhis 16-year-old sister, Delores, to the police station and files charges\nagainst Wood for getting her pregnant. Upon hearing that it concerns Wood,\nTibbs insists on being present when Delores is questioned. Purdy at first\nrefuses to have anything said in front of Tibbs, but he is easily rebuffed by\nboth Tibbs and Gillespie, and the questioning goes ahead. Insulted and\noffended that a black man was present, Purdy gathers a mob intending to do\nviolence against Tibbs. Meanwhile Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was\ncommitted at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood of the murder\ncharge, because he couldn't have driven both his and Colbert's car back into\ntown (a factor prefigured when Gillespie leaves his vehicle outside Ralph's\nrestaurant to join Tibbs in Wood's car). Tibbs adds that he knows why Wood\nchanged his route: Delores while at home alone at night likes to display her\nnaked body to whoever is outside, and Wood, who watches her while on duty,\ndoesn't want Tibbs to see a white woman in the nude. Tibbs visits a backstreet\nabortionist, who under pressure reveals that she is about to perform an\nabortion on Delores. Delores arrives, sees Tibbs, and runs away. Tibbs follows\nher and comes face to face with her armed boyfriend, Ralph, from the\nrestaurant. At that moment Purdy's mob arrives on the scene and holds Tibbs at\ngunpoint. Tibbs shouts at Purdy to check Delores' purse, that it contains\nmoney Ralph gave her for an abortion, which he got when he robbed and killed\nColbert. Purdy grabs the purse and looks inside, and realizes Tibbs is right.\nPurdy confronts Ralph for getting his sister pregnant, and a startled Ralph\nshoots Purdy dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun, and just then Gillespie arrives on\nthe scene. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he had started\nout just asking Colbert for a job at the new factory, but ended up attacking\nhim from behind with a wooden post and taking his money. \"That's all. I didn't\nmean to kill him,\" are the final words of Ralph's taped confession. The final\nscene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie,\nhaving carried his suitcase, respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs\n  * Rod Steiger as Gillespie\n  * Warren Oates as Sam Wood\n  * Lee Grant as Mrs. Colbert\n  * Larry Gates as Endicott\n  * James Patterson as Mr. Purdy\n  * William Schallert as Mayor Schubert\n  * Beah Richards as Mama Caleba\n  * Peter Whitney as Courtney\n\n  * Kermit Murdock as Henderson\n  * Larry D.

The famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the\nnovel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the\ntextbook Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to\nHistory), Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie\nfor you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him\nright back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this\nmovie.' I try not to do things that are against nature.\" However, Poitier's\nversion of the story is contradicted by Mark Harris in his book, Pictures at a\nRevolution. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay\nthat he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by\nJewison and Silliphant. The film is also important for being the first major\nHollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black\nperson. Haskell Wexler recognized that standard strong lighting used in\nfilming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the\nfeatures indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with\nbetter photographic results.\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the\nsoundtrack album was released on the United Artists label in 1967. The title\nsong performed by Ray Charles, composed by Quincy Jones, with lyrics by Alan\nand Marilyn Bergman was released as a single by ABC Records and reached #33 on\nthe Billboard Hot 100 chart and #21 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart.\nAllMusic's Steven McDonald said the soundtrack had \"a tone of righteous fury\nwoven throughout\" and that \"the intent behind In the Heat of the Night was to\nget a Southern, blues-inflected atmosphere to support the angry, anti-racist\napproach of the picture ... although the cues from In the Heat of the Night\nshow their age\". The Vinyl Factory said \"this soundtrack to a film about\nracism in the South has a cool, decidedly Southern-fried sound with funk-\nbottomed bluesy touches, like on the strutting 'Cotton Curtain', the down 'n'\ndirty 'Whipping Boy' or the fat 'n' sassy 'Chief's Drive to Mayor'\".\n\n### Track listing\n\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones\n\n  1. \"In the Heat of the Night' (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) \u2014 2:30\n  2. \"Peep-Freak Patrol Car\" \u2014 1:30\n  3. \"Cotton Curtain\" \u2014 2:33\n  4. \"Where Whitey Ain't Around\" \u2014 1:11\n  5. \"Whipping Boy\" \u2014 1:25\n  6. \"No You Won't\" \u2014 1:34\n  7. \"Nitty Gritty Time\" \u2014 1:50\n  8. \"It Sure Is Groovy!\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman)\n  9. \"Bowlegged Polly\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman)\n  10. \"Shag Bag, Hounds & Harvey\" \u2014 3:28\n  11. \"Chief's Drive to Mayor\" \u20141:10\n  12. \"Give Me Until Morning\" \u2014 1:09\n  13. \"On Your Feet, Boy!\" \u2014 1:37\n  14. \"Blood & Roots\" \u2014 1:07\n  15. \"Mama Caleba's Blues\" \u2014 5:00\n  16. \"Foul Owl [on the Prowl]\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) \n\n### Personnel\n\n  * Unidentified orchestra arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones including\n    * Ray Charles \u2014 vocals (track 1), piano (track 15)\n    * Glen Campbell \u2014 vocals (track 9), banjo\n    * Boomer and Travis (track 16), Gil Bernal (track 8) \u2014 vocals\n    * Roland Kirk \u2014 flute\n    * Bobby Scott \u2014 tack piano\n    * Billy Preston \u2014 electric organ (track 1)\n    * Ray Brown \u2014 bass\n    * Don Elliott \u2014 human instrument\n    * The Raelettes \u2014 backing vocals (track 1)\n\n## Reception\n\nIn contrast to films like The Chase and Hurry Sundown, which offered confused\nvisions of the South, In the Heat of the Night offered a tough, edgy vision of\na Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme\nreflecting the uncertain mood of the time as the civil rights movement\nattempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-\nracist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of\ndifficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for\na long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is\ntrying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles\nin your way.\" In one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name \"Virgil\" by\nsaying, \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia!\nWhat do they call you up there?\" An annoyed Tibbs replies, \"They call me\nMister Tibbs!\" The line was later listed as number 16 on the American Film\nInstitute's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, a list of top film quotes, and was\nalso the title of the sequel. An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps\nshocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs\nresponds by slapping him back. In a San Francisco pre-screening, Jewison was\nconcerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a\ncomedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced\nJewison that the film was effective as drama. That scene helped make the film\nso popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically\nstrike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, Super-spade\nVersus the Rednecks. During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier\noccasionally went to the Capitol Theatre in New York to amuse themselves\nseeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be\nimmediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's\nretaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThen-freshman critic Roger Ebert in 1967 gave In the Heat of the Night a\npositive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.\nA.D. Murphy of Variety felt it was a good but uneven film. The film currently\nholds a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten\nTomatoes, out of 46 reviews collected with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its\nconsensus states, \"Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted\nby strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman\nJewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to\nresonate today.\"\n\n## Evaluation in film guides\n\nSteven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV (1972\u201373 edition) gives In the Heat of the\nNight its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an \"[E]xciting,\nsuperbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a\nsmall Mississippi town\", with the concluding sentences stating, \"[D]irector\nNorman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of\nlife in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are\nuniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects.\" Leonard Maltin's TV Movies\n& Video Guide (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest\nrating of 4 stars, concluding that \"[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated\none bit\u2014tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid\nQuincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture ...\" Mick Martin's &\nMarsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at\n4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the\nexcellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\" British references,\nlikewise, show high regard for the film, with David Shipman in his 1984 The\nGood Film and Video Guide giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that \"[A]s mystery\nor detective story this film is only fair, but it has enormous tension. Within\nits given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in\nthe eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer,\nand malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are\ntwo remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and\nLarry Gates.\" Another British film critic with a highly personal Film Guide,\nLeslie Halliwell, gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition\n(1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing\n(and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway.\" The Guide\ncontinued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st\nedition, Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide 2007, John Walker, who took over\nas the Guide's author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and\nrewrote the evaluation to state that it is \"[A] tense and exciting thriller\nthat also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting\npersonalities.\"\n\n## Home media\n\nIn the Heat of the Night was first released on DVD in 2001. In 2010, the film\nwas digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on MGM HD. In 2014, MGM\nreleased the film on Blu-ray. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray from The\nCriterion Collection in January 2019.\n\n## Preservation\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved In the Heat of the Night in 1997.\n\n## Accolades\n\nIn the Heat of the Night was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning five.\n\nAcademy Award wins\n\n* Academy Award for Best Picture \u2014 Walter Mirisch\n* Academy Award for Best Actor \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* Academy Award for Best Film Editing \u2014 Hal Ashby\n* Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing \u2014 Samuel Goldwyn Studios\n* Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n\nAcademy Award nominations\n\n* Academy Award for Best Director \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Academy Award for Best Sound Effects \u2014 James Richard\n\nOther awards\n\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* BAFTA UN Award \u2014 Walter Mirisch\n* Edgar Award \u2014 Best Motion Picture Screenplay \u2014 Stirling Silliphant (Ball's book also received an Edgar, for Best First Novel)\n* New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best Picture \u2014 Walter Mirisch\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\n\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition): #75\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: Virgil Tibbs #19 Hero\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\n    * Virgil Tibbs: \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\": #16\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers: # 21\n\nOther nominations\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2014 Sidney Poitier\n* BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Directors Guild of America for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Director \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor\u2014Drama \u2014 Sidney Poitier\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2014 Lee Grant\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2014 Quentin Dean\n* Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media \u2014 Quincy Jones\n* Writers Guild of America for Best Written American Drama \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of American films of 1967\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * In the Heat of the Night: The Double Bind an essay by K.

      "# In the Heat of the Night (Ray Charles song)\n\n\"In the Heat of the Night\" is a 1967 song performed by Ray Charles, composed\nby Quincy Jones, and written by Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman for the film\nIn the Heat of the Night. As Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic states, the song\n\"opens the film and accompanying soundtrack with a slice of real, rural\nbackwoods gospel. Lyrically, one of the key lines is 'In the heat of the\nnight/I'm feeling motherless somehow,' which clearly illustrates the main\ncharacter's dilemma of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The main\nmelody is guided by Charles' funky piano work and is buttressed by then-\nsession ace Billy Preston's powerful, soulful organ trills. The underlying\nsense of drama that is so much a part of the film is reflected perfectly in\nthis song, and the Ray Charles Singers add to this with a stately grace. It's\nperfect listening for a midsummer night when the temperature is just a bit too\nhot for comfort.\" Released as a single by ABC Records, Charles' version of the\nsong reached #33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #21 on the Hot Rhythm &\nBlues Singles chart. The song was also released on the soundtrack album on\nUnited Artists in 1967. For the 1988\u201395 television series of the same name,\nthe song was recorded by Bill Champlin.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# Beauty and the Beast (1987 film)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (alternatively: Cannon Movie Tales: Beauty and the Beast\nin United States, Die Sch\u00f6ne und das Biest in West Germany, La Bella e la\nBestia in Italy, La Belle et la B\u00eate in France) is a 1987 American/Israeli\nmusical film, part of the 1980 film series Cannon Movie Tales. It is a\ncontemporary version of the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. The movie\nwas filmed entirely in Israel, and the taglines were: \"The monster they feared\nwas the prince she loved\" and \"The classic fairy tale about seeing with your\nheart\".\n\n## Plot\n\nA wealthy merchant lives an affluent life with his two sons, Oliver and\nFrederick, and three daughters, Bettina, Isabella and Beauty. Beauty, the\nyoungest daughter, is the caretaker of her family; without her, none of the\nfamily can look after themselves, and she is constantly taking care of her\nsiblings. Despite this, Beauty is not frustrated, but she wonders what she\nwould do with her life if she did not devote it to her family. After the\nmerchant loses his wealth in a storm at sea, the family must renounce their\nluxurious life and move to the countryside, with Beauty once again taking\ncharge. After a time, the family hear that their wealth may be returned, for a\nship has made it to port. To celebrate, the father promises his children gifts\nof luxury, but Beauty merely wants a rose. The merchant realises it was a lost\ncause, for he is still as poor as he was when he left, and returns. He stops\noff at a beautiful castle where an unseen host treats him to good food and a\nwarm bed. However, the old man plucks a rose from the garden, and the host\ndemands that as punishment, Beauty must come to live with him. Beauty moves to\nthe castle, and is alone for the first time in her life. Therefore, she\nrealises what she wants to do with her life, and realises that the Beast (the\nformerly unseen host) is not a complete monster. When Beauty's father takes\nher to the castle, the Beast gives him two chests of gold and horses to carry\nit, as compensation for giving up his daughter. It seems that while in the\ncastle anything she wants magically appears. The Beast has magical powers and\ngrants all her wishes. The only time they see each other is at diner. He holds\na rose and each night asks, \"Do you love me? Will you marry me?\". She always\nreplies \"No.\" Every night she dreams of a prince whom she loves (despite it\nbeing only a dream). She is shocked when she finds paintings of this dream\nprince in Beast's castle. Over time she is happy at the castle, but asks the\nBeast if she can visit her family, for she misses them. He allows her and says\n\"Be back in one month, or I will die.\" Also time flows differently. In the\ncastle it has been about a week, but to the outside world it has been a year.\nWhile with her family they learn how to care for themselves instead of Beauty\nhaving to take care of them. She thinks about Beast and has to return, against\nher family's urging her to stay. Upon returning to the castle she finds Beast\ndying for her lateness. She cries and mourns, begging Beast not to die. That's\nwhen she realizes how much she cares for him. So he asks again \"Will you marry\nme\" she finally says \"Yes.\" That breaks the curse and Beast heals. He also\nturns into the prince she been dreaming about. He tells her about the curse.\nAll his former subjects reappear along with her family who can now visit her\nwhenever they want. She and the prince wed, and she becomes a princess.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * John Savage \u2013 Beast / Prince\n  * Rebecca De Mornay \u2013 Beauty\n  * Yossi Graber \u2013 Father\n  * Michael Schneider \u2013 Kuppel\n  * Carmela Marner \u2013 Bettina\n  * Ruth Harlap \u2013 Isabella\n  * Joseph Bee \u2013 Oliver\n  * Jack Messinger \u2013 Frederick\n  * Tzipi Mor \u2013 1st Maid\n  * Firat Kanter \u2013 2nd Maid\n  * Ya'ackov Ben-Sira \u2013 Bailiff (as Yaacov Ben-Sira)\n  * Rafi Goldvasser \u2013 Acrobat / Juggler\n  * Eduardo Hobshar \u2013 Acrobat / Juggler\n  * Nitzan Zytzer \u2013 Acrobat / Juggler\n  * Eran Lavy \u2013 Acrobat / Juggler\n  * Deborah Sherph \u2013 Innkeeper\n  * Amiram Atias \u2013 Statue\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n  * \"Without Us\"\n  * \"This Life Is For Me\"\n  * \"If You See With Your Heart\"\n  * \"Wish For The Moon\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Beauty and the Beast at MGM\n\n",

      "# Summer of '42 (book)\n\nSummer of '42 is a novel written by Herman Raucher, based upon his screenplay\nand personal experience. In 2002 TCPalms interview, Herman Raucher mentions\nthat the 1971 film with the same title gave birth to the book Summer of '42.\nRaucher wrote the screenplay for the 1971 film version. The 1971 movie was\nwritten first. When the film was in post-production, someone told him to write\nthe book about Summer of '42 to help publicize the picture. So Raucher wrote\nthe book in about three or four weeks. The book became a bestseller prior to\nthe film's release, so the film was publicized as \"from Herman Raucher's\nnational best seller.\" Both the film and this book are based on the real\nincidents that happened during the summer of 1942 in Raucher's life. Raucher's\nnovelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, \"To those I love, past\nand present,\" serves more as the tribute to his friend Oscar Seltzer that he\nhad intended the film to be, with the focus of the book being more on the two\nboys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy. The book also\nmentions Seltzer's death, which is absent from the film adaptation.\n\n## Differences between the book and the film version\n\nThere are differences between the real life incident that happened during the\nnight and the incident in the film. The book stayed faithful to the real\nincident that happened during that night. In 2002 TCPalms Interview, Raucher\npointed out that the real Dorothy was drinking heavily when he visited Dorothy\nduring night time. This is implied in the book. But in the film, it is only\nimplied that Dorothy \"may\" have been drinking. But when Dorothy appears to\nHermie in the film, visually there is no indication of her being drunk at all.\nIn the film, Dorothy is completely aware of what is going on. In both the real\nincident and in the book, the song that was played on the phonograph record\nwas \"That Old Feeling\". In the film, the composer, Michel Legrand, wrote a new\nscore for the dancing scene. The real life incident took place in Nantucket\nIsland. But the name of the island is not mentioned in the film. In the book,\nthe name of the island was changed to Patchett Island. In the real incident,\nthe real Dorothy kept calling Hermie \"Pete\" thinking that Hermie was her\nhusband while they both were in bed. There is no indication in the film that\nDorothy is imagining Hermie as her husband Pete. In the book, it is only\nmentioned that Dorothy talked about private things that Hermie was not\nfamiliar with. Unlike the film, the book shows that the tears come out of\nHermie's eyes while the music \"That Old Feeling\" is playing. For the film,\nRaucher admitted about moving the order of certain events around and\ninterchanging some dialogue. There are several differences between Dorothy in\nthe book and Dorothy in the film. One of several changes is where Hermie's\ntongue gets hurt by the coffee. Both in the film and in the book, Dorothy\nhelps Hermie by providing ice when Hermie's tongue gets hurt by the hot\ncoffee. Unlike Dorothy in the book, Dorothy in the film repeatedly apologizes\nto Hermie for the coffee being too hot and makes sure that he is doing fine.\nIn the film, Dorothy moves on to her work and also to a conversation \"only\"\nafter she makes sure that Hermie's tongue is feeling better. But in the book,\nthere is no indication of an apology from Dorothy. In the book, when Hermie\nwas \"able\" to look up to see what Dorothy was doing after getting relief from\nthe ice cubes in the coffee, he saw her sitting opposite to him and she was\nalready eating one of the doughnuts and she was talking about her old 1934\nstove.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Summer of '42 (film)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n",
      "# In the Heat of the Night (film)\n\nIn the Heat of the Night is a 1967 American mystery drama film directed by\nNorman Jewison. It is based on John Ball's 1965 novel of the same name and\ntells the story of Virgil Tibbs, a black police detective from Philadelphia,\nwho becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in Mississippi.\nIt stars Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, and was produced by Walter Mirisch.\nThe screenplay was by Stirling Silliphant. The film won five Academy Awards,\nincluding the 1967 awards for Best Picture and Rod Steiger for Best Actor. The\nfilm was followed by two sequels, They Call Me Mister Tibbs! in 1970, and The\nOrganization in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a television series\nadaptation of the same name. Although the film was set in the fictional\nMississippi town of Sparta (with supposedly no connection to the real Sparta,\nMississippi), most of the movie was filmed in Sparta, Illinois, where many of\nthe film's landmarks can still be seen. The quote \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\nwas listed as number 16 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movie\nQuotes, a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for\npreservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of\nCongress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from Chicago\nto Sparta, Mississippi, to build a factory there. Late one night, police\nofficer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body lying in the street. Chief\nGillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been\ndead for a few hours. Wood, sent by the chief to check out various town access\nand exit points, finds a black man, Virgil Tibbs, at the train station and\narrests him. Gillespie accuses Tibbs of the murder, and is embarrassed to\nlearn Tibbs is a police officer from Philadelphia. Gillespie phones Tibbs's\nchief, who informs Gillespie that Tibbs is a top homicide detective and\nrecommends that he should assist the investigation. The idea does not appeal\nto either Gillespie or Tibbs, but for reasons of their own they reluctantly\nagree. Tibbs examines Colbert's body and concludes the murder happened earlier\nthan the doctor had estimated, that the killer was right-handed, and that the\nbody had been killed elsewhere and then moved to where it was found. Gillespie\narrests another suspect, Harvey Oberst, who protests his innocence. The police\nare planning to beat a confession out of him, until Tibbs learns Oberst is\nleft-handed and has an alibi backed up by witnesses, which clears him of the\nmurder. The victim's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the police and\nimpressed by Tibbs. She threatens to halt construction of the factory unless\nTibbs leads the investigation, and the town's leading citizens are forced to\ngo along with her wish. The two policemen begin to respect each other as they\nare forced to work together. Tibbs initially suspects plantation owner\nEndicott, a genteel racist and one of the most powerful individuals in town,\nwho publicly opposed the new factory. When Tibbs interrogates Endicott,\nEndicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang\nof hooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues Tibbs and tells him to leave town\nfor his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case and take Endicott\ndown. Gillespie points out to Tibbs how bitter he has become. Tibbs asks Wood\nto re-trace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie\njoins them. When they arrive at an all-night restaurant, Ralph, working behind\nthe counter, refuses to serve Tibbs. Later, when Tibbs asks Wood why he\nchanged his route, Gillespie starts suspecting Wood. Gillespie discovers that\nWood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder.\nGillespie arrests Wood despite Tibbs's protests. Purdy, a nasty local, brings\nhis 16-year-old sister, Delores, to the police station and files charges\nagainst Wood for getting her pregnant. Upon hearing that it concerns Wood,\nTibbs insists on being present when Delores is questioned. Purdy at first\nrefuses to have anything said in front of Tibbs, but he is easily rebuffed by\nboth Tibbs and Gillespie, and the questioning goes ahead. Insulted and\noffended that a black man was present, Purdy gathers a mob intending to do\nviolence against Tibbs. Meanwhile Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was\ncommitted at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood of the murder\ncharge, because he couldn't have driven both his and Colbert's car back into\ntown (a factor prefigured when Gillespie leaves his vehicle outside Ralph's\nrestaurant to join Tibbs in Wood's car). Tibbs adds that he knows why Wood\nchanged his route: Delores while at home alone at night likes to display her\nnaked body to whoever is outside, and Wood, who watches her while on duty,\ndoesn't want Tibbs to see a white woman in the nude. Tibbs visits a backstreet\nabortionist, who under pressure reveals that she is about to perform an\nabortion on Delores. Delores arrives, sees Tibbs, and runs away. Tibbs follows\nher and comes face to face with her armed boyfriend, Ralph, from the\nrestaurant. At that moment Purdy's mob arrives on the scene and holds Tibbs at\ngunpoint. Tibbs shouts at Purdy to check Delores' purse, that it contains\nmoney Ralph gave her for an abortion, which he got when he robbed and killed\nColbert. Purdy grabs the purse and looks inside, and realizes Tibbs is right.\nPurdy confronts Ralph for getting his sister pregnant, and a startled Ralph\nshoots Purdy dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun, and just then Gillespie arrives on\nthe scene. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he had started\nout just asking Colbert for a job at the new factory, but ended up attacking\nhim from behind with a wooden post and taking his money. \"That's all. I didn't\nmean to kill him,\" are the final words of Ralph's taped confession. The final\nscene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie,\nhaving carried his suitcase, respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs\n  * Rod Steiger as Gillespie\n  * Warren Oates as Sam Wood\n  * Lee Grant as Mrs. Colbert\n  * Larry Gates as Endicott\n  * James Patterson as Mr. Purdy\n  * William Schallert as Mayor Schubert\n  * Beah Richards as Mama Caleba\n  * Peter Whitney as Courtney\n\n  * Kermit Murdock as Henderson\n  * Larry D.

The famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the\nnovel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the\ntextbook Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to\nHistory), Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie\nfor you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him\nright back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this\nmovie.' I try not to do things that are against nature.\" However, Poitier's\nversion of the story is contradicted by Mark Harris in his book, Pictures at a\nRevolution. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay\nthat he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by\nJewison and Silliphant. The film is also important for being the first major\nHollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black\nperson. Haskell Wexler recognized that standard strong lighting used in\nfilming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the\nfeatures indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with\nbetter photographic results.\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the\nsoundtrack album was released on the United Artists label in 1967. The title\nsong performed by Ray Charles, composed by Quincy Jones, with lyrics by Alan\nand Marilyn Bergman was released as a single by ABC Records and reached #33 on\nthe Billboard Hot 100 chart and #21 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart.\nAllMusic's Steven McDonald said the soundtrack had \"a tone of righteous fury\nwoven throughout\" and that \"the intent behind In the Heat of the Night was to\nget a Southern, blues-inflected atmosphere to support the angry, anti-racist\napproach of the picture ... although the cues from In the Heat of the Night\nshow their age\". The Vinyl Factory said \"this soundtrack to a film about\nracism in the South has a cool, decidedly Southern-fried sound with funk-\nbottomed bluesy touches, like on the strutting 'Cotton Curtain', the down 'n'\ndirty 'Whipping Boy' or the fat 'n' sassy 'Chief's Drive to Mayor'\".\n\n### Track listing\n\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones\n\n  1. \"In the Heat of the Night' (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) \u2014 2:30\n  2. \"Peep-Freak Patrol Car\" \u2014 1:30\n  3. \"Cotton Curtain\" \u2014 2:33\n  4. \"Where Whitey Ain't Around\" \u2014 1:11\n  5. \"Whipping Boy\" \u2014 1:25\n  6. \"No You Won't\" \u2014 1:34\n  7. \"Nitty Gritty Time\" \u2014 1:50\n  8. \"It Sure Is Groovy!\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman)\n  9. \"Bowlegged Polly\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman)\n  10. \"Shag Bag, Hounds & Harvey\" \u2014 3:28\n  11. \"Chief's Drive to Mayor\" \u20141:10\n  12. \"Give Me Until Morning\" \u2014 1:09\n  13. \"On Your Feet, Boy!\" \u2014 1:37\n  14. \"Blood & Roots\" \u2014 1:07\n  15. \"Mama Caleba's Blues\" \u2014 5:00\n  16. \"Foul Owl [on the Prowl]\" \u2014 2:30 (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) \n\n### Personnel\n\n  * Unidentified orchestra arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones including\n    * Ray Charles \u2014 vocals (track 1), piano (track 15)\n    * Glen Campbell \u2014 vocals (track 9), banjo\n    * Boomer and Travis (track 16), Gil Bernal (track 8) \u2014 vocals\n    * Roland Kirk \u2014 flute\n    * Bobby Scott \u2014 tack piano\n    * Billy Preston \u2014 electric organ (track 1)\n    * Ray Brown \u2014 bass\n    * Don Elliott \u2014 human instrument\n    * The Raelettes \u2014 backing vocals (track 1)\n\n## Reception\n\nIn contrast to films like The Chase and Hurry Sundown, which offered confused\nvisions of the South, In the Heat of the Night offered a tough, edgy vision of\na Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme\nreflecting the uncertain mood of the time as the civil rights movement\nattempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-\nracist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of\ndifficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for\na long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is\ntrying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles\nin your way.\" In one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name \"Virgil\" by\nsaying, \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia!\nWhat do they call you up there?\" An annoyed Tibbs replies, \"They call me\nMister Tibbs!\" The line was later listed as number 16 on the American Film\nInstitute's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, a list of top film quotes, and was\nalso the title of the sequel. An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps\nshocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs\nresponds by slapping him back. In a San Francisco pre-screening, Jewison was\nconcerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a\ncomedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced\nJewison that the film was effective as drama. That scene helped make the film\nso popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically\nstrike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, Super-spade\nVersus the Rednecks. During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier\noccasionally went to the Capitol Theatre in New York to amuse themselves\nseeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be\nimmediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's\nretaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThen-freshman critic Roger Ebert in 1967 gave In the Heat of the Night a\npositive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.\nA.D. Murphy of Variety felt it was a good but uneven film. The film currently\nholds a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten\nTomatoes, out of 46 reviews collected with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its\nconsensus states, \"Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted\nby strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman\nJewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to\nresonate today.\"\n\n## Evaluation in film guides\n\nSteven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV (1972\u201373 edition) gives In the Heat of the\nNight its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an \"[E]xciting,\nsuperbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a\nsmall Mississippi town\", with the concluding sentences stating, \"[D]irector\nNorman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of\nlife in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are\nuniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects.\" Leonard Maltin's TV Movies\n& Video Guide (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest\nrating of 4 stars, concluding that \"[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated\none bit\u2014tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid\nQuincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture ...\" Mick Martin's &\nMarsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at\n4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the\nexcellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\" British references,\nlikewise, show high regard for the film, with David Shipman in his 1984 The\nGood Film and Video Guide giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that \"[A]s mystery\nor detective story this film is only fair, but it has enormous tension. Within\nits given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in\nthe eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer,\nand malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are\ntwo remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and\nLarry Gates.\" Another British film critic with a highly personal Film Guide,\nLeslie Halliwell, gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition\n(1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing\n(and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway.\" The Guide\ncontinued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st\nedition, Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide 2007, John Walker, who took over\nas the Guide's author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and\nrewrote the evaluation to state that it is \"[A] tense and exciting thriller\nthat also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting\npersonalities.\"\n\n## Home media\n\nIn the Heat of the Night was first released on DVD in 2001. In 2010, the film\nwas digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on MGM HD. In 2014, MGM\nreleased the film on Blu-ray. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray from The\nCriterion Collection in January 2019.\n\n## Preservation\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved In the Heat of the Night in 1997.\n\n## Accolades\n\nIn the Heat of the Night was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning five.\n\nAcademy Award wins\n\n* Academy Award for Best Picture \u2014 Walter Mirisch\n* Academy Award for Best Actor \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* Academy Award for Best Film Editing \u2014 Hal Ashby\n* Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing \u2014 Samuel Goldwyn Studios\n* Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n\nAcademy Award nominations\n\n* Academy Award for Best Director \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Academy Award for Best Sound Effects \u2014 James Richard\n\nOther awards\n\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2014 Rod Steiger\n* BAFTA UN Award \u2014 Walter Mirisch\n* Edgar Award \u2014 Best Motion Picture Screenplay \u2014 Stirling Silliphant (Ball's book also received an Edgar, for Best First Novel)\n* New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best Picture \u2014 Walter Mirisch\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\n\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition): #75\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: Virgil Tibbs #19 Hero\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\n    * Virgil Tibbs: \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\": #16\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers: # 21\n\nOther nominations\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2014 Sidney Poitier\n* BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Directors Guild of America for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Director \u2014 Norman Jewison\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor\u2014Drama \u2014 Sidney Poitier\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2014 Lee Grant\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2014 Quentin Dean\n* Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media \u2014 Quincy Jones\n* Writers Guild of America for Best Written American Drama \u2014 Stirling Silliphant\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of American films of 1967\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * In the Heat of the Night: The Double Bind an essay by K.

Much like the television season\nthat followed the release, it used concepts from the Japanese Super Sentai\nseries Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai\nKakuranger. It is the first Power Rangers production from Saban Entertainment\nnot to feature any archived footage from Super Sentai. The events of the film\ntake place between the second and third seasons of \"Mighty Morphin Power\nRangers\". Filming took place in and around Sydney and Queensland, Australia. A\nsequel, titled was released March 28, 1997. This movie was released June 30,\n1995 and grossed $66.43 million worldwide, but received mixed reviews from\ncritics. Since, it is considered a cult classic.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Mighty Morphin Power Rangers participate with Bulk and Skull in a charity\nskydive for the Angel Grove observatory, in anticipation of Ryan's Comet which\nis scheduled to pass by in two days. Bulk and Skull miss the target landing\nzone and accidentally land in a construction site where a giant egg has been\nunearthed. Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, Goldar, and Mordant arrive at the\nconstruction site and crack open the egg, releasing Ivan Ooze, a morphological\nbeing who ruled Earth with an iron fist 6,000 years ago before he was\noverthrown by Zordon and a group of young warriors. The Rangers find and\nconfront him, but Ivan unleashes some ooze monsters on them. While the Rangers\nbattle and successfully defeat them, the fight distracts them long enough to\nallow Ivan to escape and he lays siege to the Rangers' Command Center and\nincapacitates Zordon, robbing the Rangers of their powers. As the Rangers\nreturn to the Command Center, they find it destroyed and Zordon, being outside\nhis time portal, aging and dying. Zordon's assistant Alpha 5 sends the Rangers\nto the distant planet Phaedos to obtain the Great Power and save Zordon. On\nthe Moon, Ivan usurps Rita and Zedd, trapping them in a snow globe, and forces\nGoldar and Mordant to be his servants, then sends his Tengu warriors to\nPhaedos and begins building an army. He uses children to bring his ooze to\ntheir parents, and it hypnotizes them into becoming his workforce to dig up\nhis Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin war machines built during his reign. When Fred\nKelman, a friend of the Rangers', discovers his father missing, he finds him\nworking at the construction site and discovers Ivan's plans. On Phaedos, the\nRangers are almost killed by the Tengu, but are rescued by Dulcea, Phaedos'\nMaster Warrior. She initially tells them to leave for their own safety, but\nafter hearing of Zordon's plight, she agrees to help them and takes them to an\nancient ruined temple where the Rangers will have to overcome obstacles to\nacquire the power of the Ninjetti. Dulcea awakens each Rangers' animal spirit:\nAisha Campbell is the bear, Rocky DeSantos is the ape, Billy Cranston is the\nwolf, Kimberly Ann Hart is the crane, Adam Park is the frog and Tommy Oliver\nis the falcon. The Rangers make their way to the Monolith housing the Great\nPower, defeating its Stone Gargoyle guardians, and retrieve the Great Power.\nOn Earth, Ivan's Ecto-Morphicons are completely unearthed, and he unleashes\nthem on Angel Grove, ordering the parents to commit suicide at the\nconstruction site. Fred, Bulk, Skull and the other kids head to the\nconstruction site to save their parents. The Rangers return with their new\nanimal-themed Ninja Zords and, after a difficult struggle, destroy one of\nIvan's Ecto-Morphicons, Scorpitron. Ivan takes control of Hornitor and becomes\na giant and battles the Rangers himself as the Rangers combined their Zords to\nform the Ninja Megazord and later the Ninja Falcon Megazord. The Rangers lead\nIvan into space right into the path of Ryan's Comet, which destroys him. His\ndestruction breaks the hypnosis and the parents are reunited with their\nchildren. The Rangers then return to the Command Center, but are distraught to\nfind Zordan is dead. Then, they use the Great Power to restore the Command\nCenter and resurrect Zordon, returning him to his time portal. later on\neverything returns back to normal in Angel Grove as a celebration was held\nwith fireworks shooting up to the sky and a message saying \"Thank You Power\nRangers\". In a mid-credits scene, Goldar briefly lounges in Zedd's throne,\nbeing served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita appear, having been\nreleased after Ivan was destroyed, and not very happy over Goldar and Mordant\nsiding with Ivan earlier.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Karan Ashley as Aisha Campbell, The Yellow Ranger\n  * Johnny Yong Bosch as Adam Park, The Black Ranger\n  * Steve Cardenas as Rocky DeSantos, The Red Ranger\n  * Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver, The White Ranger\n  * Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberly Hart, The Pink Ranger\n  * David Yost as Billy Cranston, The Blue Ranger\n  * Jason Narvy as Eugene \"Skull\" Skullovitch\n  * Paul Schrier as Farkas \"Bulk\" Bulkmeier\n  * Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze\n  * Gabrielle Fitzpatrick as Dulcea\n  * Nicholas Bell as Zordon\n  * Peta-Maree Rixon as Alpha 5\n  * Jean Paul Bell as Mordant\n  * Kerry Casey as Goldar\n  * Mark Ginther as Lord Zedd\n  * Julia Cortez as Rita Repulsa\n  * Jamie Croft as Fred Kelman\n  * Paul Goddard and Robert Simper as Construction workers\n\n### Voices\n\n  * Kerrigan Mahan as Goldar\n  * Robert L.

It stars the\nensemble cast of Karan Ashley, Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Cardenas, Jason David\nFrank, Amy Jo Johnson, and David Yost alongside the villains cast from the\noriginal series and Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. Much like the television season\nthat followed the release, it used concepts from the Japanese Super Sentai\nseries Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai\nKakuranger. It is the first Power Rangers production from Saban Entertainment\nnot to feature any archived footage from Super Sentai. The events of the film\ntake place between the second and third seasons of \"Mighty Morphin Power\nRangers\". Filming took place in and around Sydney and Queensland, Australia. A\nsequel, titled was released March 28, 1997. This movie was released June 30,\n1995 and grossed $66.43 million worldwide, but received mixed reviews from\ncritics. Since, it is considered a cult classic.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Mighty Morphin Power Rangers participate with Bulk and Skull in a charity\nskydive for the Angel Grove observatory, in anticipation of Ryan's Comet which\nis scheduled to pass by in two days. Bulk and Skull miss the target landing\nzone and accidentally land in a construction site where a giant egg has been\nunearthed. Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, Goldar, and Mordant arrive at the\nconstruction site and crack open the egg, releasing Ivan Ooze, a morphological\nbeing who ruled Earth with an iron fist 6,000 years ago before he was\noverthrown by Zordon and a group of young warriors. The Rangers find and\nconfront him, but Ivan unleashes some ooze monsters on them. While the Rangers\nbattle and successfully defeat them, the fight distracts them long enough to\nallow Ivan to escape and he lays siege to the Rangers' Command Center and\nincapacitates Zordon, robbing the Rangers of their powers. As the Rangers\nreturn to the Command Center, they find it destroyed and Zordon, being outside\nhis time portal, aging and dying. Zordon's assistant Alpha 5 sends the Rangers\nto the distant planet Phaedos to obtain the Great Power and save Zordon. On\nthe Moon, Ivan usurps Rita and Zedd, trapping them in a snow globe, and forces\nGoldar and Mordant to be his servants, then sends his Tengu warriors to\nPhaedos and begins building an army. He uses children to bring his ooze to\ntheir parents, and it hypnotizes them into becoming his workforce to dig up\nhis Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin war machines built during his reign. When Fred\nKelman, a friend of the Rangers', discovers his father missing, he finds him\nworking at the construction site and discovers Ivan's plans. On Phaedos, the\nRangers are almost killed by the Tengu, but are rescued by Dulcea, Phaedos'\nMaster Warrior. She initially tells them to leave for their own safety, but\nafter hearing of Zordon's plight, she agrees to help them and takes them to an\nancient ruined temple where the Rangers will have to overcome obstacles to\nacquire the power of the Ninjetti. Dulcea awakens each Rangers' animal spirit:\nAisha Campbell is the bear, Rocky DeSantos is the ape, Billy Cranston is the\nwolf, Kimberly Ann Hart is the crane, Adam Park is the frog and Tommy Oliver\nis the falcon. The Rangers make their way to the Monolith housing the Great\nPower, defeating its Stone Gargoyle guardians, and retrieve the Great Power.\nOn Earth, Ivan's Ecto-Morphicons are completely unearthed, and he unleashes\nthem on Angel Grove, ordering the parents to commit suicide at the\nconstruction site. Fred, Bulk, Skull and the other kids head to the\nconstruction site to save their parents. The Rangers return with their new\nanimal-themed Ninja Zords and, after a difficult struggle, destroy one of\nIvan's Ecto-Morphicons, Scorpitron. Ivan takes control of Hornitor and becomes\na giant and battles the Rangers himself as the Rangers combined their Zords to\nform the Ninja Megazord and later the Ninja Falcon Megazord. The Rangers lead\nIvan into space right into the path of Ryan's Comet, which destroys him. His\ndestruction breaks the hypnosis and the parents are reunited with their\nchildren. The Rangers then return to the Command Center, but are distraught to\nfind Zordan is dead. Then, they use the Great Power to restore the Command\nCenter and resurrect Zordon, returning him to his time portal. later on\neverything returns back to normal in Angel Grove as a celebration was held\nwith fireworks shooting up to the sky and a message saying \"Thank You Power\nRangers\". In a mid-credits scene, Goldar briefly lounges in Zedd's throne,\nbeing served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita appear, having been\nreleased after Ivan was destroyed, and not very happy over Goldar and Mordant\nsiding with Ivan earlier.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * Karan Ashley as Aisha Campbell, The Yellow Ranger\n  * Johnny Yong Bosch as Adam Park, The Black Ranger\n  * Steve Cardenas as Rocky DeSantos, The Red Ranger\n  * Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver, The White Ranger\n  * Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberly Hart, The Pink Ranger\n  * David Yost as Billy Cranston, The Blue Ranger\n  * Jason Narvy as Eugene \"Skull\" Skullovitch\n  * Paul Schrier as Farkas \"Bulk\" Bulkmeier\n  * Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze\n  * Gabrielle Fitzpatrick as Dulcea\n  * Nicholas Bell as Zordon\n  * Peta-Maree Rixon as Alpha 5\n  * Jean Paul Bell as Mordant\n  * Kerry Casey as Goldar\n  * Mark Ginther as Lord Zedd\n  * Julia Cortez as Rita Repulsa\n  * Jamie Croft as Fred Kelman\n  * Paul Goddard and Robert Simper as Construction workers\n\n### Voices\n\n  * Kerrigan Mahan as Goldar\n  * Robert L.

      "# Brenda's Got a Baby\n\n\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is the second single by Tupac Shakur from his debut\nalbum 2Pacalypse Now. The song, which features R&B; singer Dave Hollister\nsinging background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl\nnamed Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song\nexplores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their\nfamilies. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the\nplight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in\ngeneral, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father,\nthe government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song while filming\nthe feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old\ngirl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash\ncompactor.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the\nrest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with\nTupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also\nnotes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a \"damn shame\"\nbecause she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her\nfather is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who\nis also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac\nexplains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got\ntheir cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin\n(her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is\nmerely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom\nfloor. She throws the baby into a 'trash heap' but later retrieves it when she\nhears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed\nof herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone,\nand unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results\nin robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn\nmoney and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of\nher parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final\nminute consists of a chorus singing \"Don't you know she's got a baby?\"\nrepeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song \"Street\nRiders\" 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals\nwith this same subject called \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\". The song can be\nfound on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what\nShakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and \"Brenda\" and then the actual\nstory starts. Ethel \"Edy\" Proctor portrays Brenda. The video begins with\n\"based on a true story,\" although the characters themselves are fictitious,\nShakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old\ngirl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a\ntrash can. Parts of the video were included in , a 2003 documentary on 2Pac's\nlife, in a television show later in the music video of \"Ghetto Gospel\", in the\nmusic video of \"Changes\" and appears as a bonus in its entirety on the film's\nDVD. Part of the video and song was played in 2Pac's biopic film, All Eyez on\nMe, released on June 16, 2017. The video was directed by the Hughes brothers.\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n"

      "# Baby mama\n\nA baby mama (also baby-mama and baby-mother) is a mother who is not married to\nher child's father, although the term is often infused with other meanings as\nwell.\n\n## Origin\n\nThe term originated in Jamaican Creole as \"baby-mother\" (pronounced ), with\nthe first printed usage appearing in the Kingston newspaper, The Daily Gleaner\nin 1966. Another Daily Gleaner use dates from November 21, 1989. Originally,\nthe term was used by the fathers of illegitimate children to describe the\nmothers of their children, but the term is now in general use to describe any\nsingle mother. Peter L. Patrick, a linguistics professor who studies Jamaican\nEnglish, has said of the terms baby mother and baby father, \"[they] definitely\nimply there is not a marriage\u2014not even a common-law marriage, but rather that\nthe child is an 'outside' child\". Since entering currency in U.S. tabloids,\nthe terms baby mama and baby daddy have even begun to be applied to married\nand engaged celebrities.\n\n## Usage\n\n### In music\n\nBaby mother and baby mama had entered wide use in American hip-hop lyrics by\nthe mid-1990s. One of the first representations of baby mamas in hip-hop\nlyrics was by southern rapper Krazy, from Tampa, Florida. One of his songs was\ntitled \"I Hate My Baby Mama.\" The Outkast song \"Ms. Jackson\", released in\n2000, was dedicated to \"all the baby mamas' mamas\". American Idol winner\nFantasia Barrino released a song entitled \"Baby Mama\" in 2004. In this song\nshe is writing an ode to black single mothers and how to be a baby mama should\nbe a \"badge of honor\". She makes firsthand acknowledgements as a single mother\nand empathizes on the thoughts of baby mamas and how they are \"fed up with\nmakin' beds up.\" Planet Earth, an album by Prince released in 2007, features a\nsong called \"Future Baby Mama\". Three 6 Mafia had a song called \"Baby Mama\" on\n. Tupac's \"Dear Mama\", and \"Brenda's got a Baby\" are two hip hop songs that\nshow a strong Black woman/ mothering trope. Through these albums and songs,\nthere has come to be an acceptance to the term \"Baby Mama\" and also a creation\nto an alternative baby daddy.\n\n### In television\n\nAll My Babies' Mamas was an unaired reality show starring rapper Shawty Lo,\nshowcasing his lifestyle as the father of 11 children, mothered by 10\ndifferent women.\n\n### In film\n\nIn 2008, Universal Pictures released a comedy entitled Baby Mama starring Tina\nFey and Amy Poehler, in which Poehler plays a woman Fey hires to be her\nsurrogate. In many films, including some like Tyler Perry's \"Meet the Browns\",\nthat was released in 2008, there are many stereotypical representations of\nblack baby mamas. Brenda, who is played by Angela Bassett, is one of the main\ncharacters in the film that is portrayed as a stereotypical Black single\nmother who is caught in an endless cycle of poverty and struggle. She has\nthree children from three different men, none of which have a presence in\ntheir child's life. Throughout the film there is not indication that Brenda is\non welfare but nevertheless, she is a clear representation of a contemporary\n\"baby mama\". In stereo-typically fashion her character is someone who is\npowerless.\n\n## References\n\n",

      "# You've Made Me So Very Happy\n\n\"You've Made Me So Very Happy\" is a song written by Brenda Holloway, Patrice\nHolloway, Frank Wilson and Berry Gordy, and was released first as a single in\n1967 by Brenda Holloway on the Tamla label. The song was later a huge hit for\njazz-rock band Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1969, and became a Gold record.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Recording\n\nBy 1967, Brenda Holloway had been recording for Motown Records since 1964 and\nhad struggled with Berry Gordy over control of her music, alleging that Gordy\nhad forced her to sing Mary Wells' \"leftover tracks\" after the Motown singer\nleft the label in 1964. Some of the songs in question included modest hits\nsuch as \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Operator\". Holloway was planning to release her\nlong-awaited second album, Hurtin' & Cryin, which had released \"Just Look What\nYou've Done\" as the leading track, but for unknown reasons the record was\nshelved. Along with her sister Patrice, using music provided by Frank Wilson\nand with additional help from Gordy himself, Holloway co-wrote \"You've Made Me\nSo Very Happy\". Coincidentally, Holloway recorded the song after a breakup\nwith a boyfriend.\n\n### Release and reaction\n\nReaction to the song was stronger than Holloway's previous offerings, rising\nto number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her third Top-40 pop\nsingle. It peaked at number 40 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart. Shortly\nafter its release, Holloway left Motown and the song was eventually featured\non her \"second\" album, The Artistry of Brenda Holloway. After two more years\nsinging background for acts such as Joe Cocker, Holloway retired to marry a\npreacher and have a family. By the mid-1990's, she had returned to music full-\ntime.

      "# Brenda's Got a Baby\n\n\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is the second single by Tupac Shakur from his debut\nalbum 2Pacalypse Now. The song, which features R&B; singer Dave Hollister\nsinging background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl\nnamed Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song\nexplores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their\nfamilies. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the\nplight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in\ngeneral, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father,\nthe government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song while filming\nthe feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old\ngirl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash\ncompactor.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the\nrest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with\nTupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also\nnotes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a \"damn shame\"\nbecause she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her\nfather is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who\nis also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac\nexplains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got\ntheir cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin\n(her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is\nmerely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom\nfloor. She throws the baby into a 'trash heap' but later retrieves it when she\nhears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed\nof herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone,\nand unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results\nin robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn\nmoney and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of\nher parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final\nminute consists of a chorus singing \"Don't you know she's got a baby?\"\nrepeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song \"Street\nRiders\" 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals\nwith this same subject called \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\". The song can be\nfound on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what\nShakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and \"Brenda\" and then the actual\nstory starts. Ethel \"Edy\" Proctor portrays Brenda. The video begins with\n\"based on a true story,\" although the characters themselves are fictitious,\nShakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old\ngirl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a\ntrash can. Parts of the video were included in , a 2003 documentary on 2Pac's\nlife, in a television show later in the music video of \"Ghetto Gospel\", in the\nmusic video of \"Changes\" and appears as a bonus in its entirety on the film's\nDVD. Part of the video and song was played in 2Pac's biopic film, All Eyez on\nMe, released on June 16, 2017. The video was directed by the Hughes brothers.\n\n## Charts\n\n## References\n\n"
