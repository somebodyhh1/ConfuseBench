At least, I don't see\n   \"startDispatching\" calls and all actions are performed in the\n   context of main thread.\n   We should discuss this issue here in dev lab. It sounds like\n   limitation and I'm not sure there is an easy way to solve it. It\n   looks like some design changes should be done in both framework\n   and code generator to solve the issue.\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:vladeruk at 5/27/2015\n   3:30:07 AM =====\n   \n   One more thought: I guess, the problem is related to thread\n   scheduling policy. Probably, if it would be some round robin\n   algorithm or another kind of prioritizing then it could work.\n   But in Windows the thread, which takes control and doesn't call\n   any synchronization API, continues working and doesn't switch to\n   another waiting thread.\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:vladeruk at 5/27/2015\n   3:07:26 AM =====\n   \n   Hi Alex,\n   \n   Application is working according to UML specification. If you\n   need more explanation, please, ask Eldad Palachi, whom I\n   discussed the issue before answering you. He is our main\n   UML/SysML expert.\n   \n   Using of timeout (btw, it can be used with duration=0, which\n   causes only context switching) is not workaround. Original model\n   actually defines endless loop. It is like \"while(true);\"\n   statement is written in C program.\n   \n   Probably, user should change Activity::General::SimulationMode\n   property to use StateOriented semantics. But I'm not familiar\n   with this area .\n   \n   Regards,\n   Vova\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:aaratzlo at 5/27/2015\n   12:26:36 AM =====\n   \n   Thanks so much for the help Vova.\n   \n   The customer, who is an IBMer, does think the implementation\n   still isn't working correctly. Here are is full comments:\n   \n   \"I can see that breaking the loop with a timer will make the\n   model work, however I think that's a bit of a hack. The whole\n   purpose of using threads (Active Concurrency) is to support the\n   type of modelling done in the model. It appears changing the\n   concurrency setting has no effect then? Eldad in development\n   thought that it should :)\n   \n   I think the timer is a workaround, but the implementation\n   doesn't work as expected.\"\n   \n   Any ideas on that?\n   \n   Thanks again!!\n   \n   \n   \n   ===== State: Engineering by:vladeruk at 5/25/2015 11:05:24 AM\n   =====\n   \n   It seems to me it is correct behavior. Since activity diagram\n   contains endless loop, it doesn't switch context from one thread\n   to another one.\n   If you add time event after operation in both activity diagrams\n   (A and B), then active context will switch. BTW, its duration\n   can be 0.\n   \n   ===== State: Support_Esc by:aaratzlo at 5/21/2015 8:17:19 PM\n   =====\n   \n   \n   \n   ****Description field information .****\n   1.

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n I am trying to run some Reports on my string data under Analyze->Reports->Report Summaries in Rows in SPSS 13.0.x and later. My variables are open-ended questions where the text may contain between 500 to 1000 characters. When I try to run this report I receive an alert message:\n\n\"The report requested is too wide. It requires a width of nnn characters but the report area width within the specified margins is 255 characters. The maximum width is 255 characters.\"\n\nI then click OK and no output is created.\n\nI have attempted to change my margins by going under Edit->Options, Viewer tab, but even the Custom Settings under \"Text Output Page Size\" will not allow me to go above 255 characters.\n\nIf SPSS now allows string variables to be more than 255 characters shouldn't I be able to obtain output on them under the Reports option? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThis issue has been noted and has been filed with SPSS Development as a feature request that Report allow more than 255 characters in the output.\n\nOne way of obtaining a report-like output on your wide string responses is to use the Summarize command with the Output Management System (OMS) and saving the file out as a Text (.txt) file.\n\nThe syntax below is an example of how you may do this. Please note that it is not necessary to edit the resulting SPSS Output. Simply open the newly created .txt file (longstring.txt in this example) in Notepad to view your responses:\n\nOMS /select tables /destination format=text outfile = 'c:\\temp\\longstring.txt'\n/if labels = 'Case Summaries'\n.\nSUMMARIZE\n/TABLES=yourvariable\n/FORMAT=LIST NOCASENUM NOTOTAL\n/TITLE='Case Summaries'\n/MISSING=VARIABLE\n/CELLS=NONE.\n\nomsend .\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

It\n   sounds like they did get 256-char comments working/displaying,\n   but they had to do something more than increase the size of the\n   Bp8Description CE property to do so?\n   Several things here.  Just increasing the size of the CE\n   property should be enough.  It works for me.  But that is\n   assuming there are some wordbreaks, since the\n   \\css\\Bp8Styles.css defines the following attribute for the\n   Comment cell on the Audit Tab -\n   .tblAuditDataWrap{\n       word-wrap:break-word;\n   }\n   - and the code in \\xsl\\Bp8CaseAudit.xsl picks it up from there.\n   In other words,\n   aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffggg\n   ggggggghhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiijjjjjjjjjjkkkkkkkkkkllllllllllmmmmmm\n   mmmmnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooopppppppppp\n   will \"work\" in the sense that the data will be saved to CE,\n   but it won't display well in BPF because the value will go off\n   the page.  I don't know of any easy way around that, short of\n   adding scrollbars to the Audit Tab.\n   But\n   aaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbb cccccccccc dddddddddd eeeeeeeeee\n   ffffffffff gggggggggg hhhhhhhhhh iiiiiiiiiijjjjjjjjjj\n   kkkkkkkkkk llllllllll mmmmmmmmmm nnnnnnnnnn oooooooooo\n   pppppppppp\n   will work fine.  Wrapping will occur and the whole value will\n   be visible.\n   We used to code a 64-char limit (maxlength) in the BPF Reasons\n   dialog (where this value would be entered) - i.e. on\n   Bp8Choices.xsl,  But we removed it to permit easy\n   configuration of the size of this field as per the above.\n   What version of BPF is this customer using?\n   Of course, it may be necessary to increase the size of the\n   Bp8Description field in two places in CE - both for the\n   stand-alone property template and for that property as it\n   exists on the Bp8AuditLogItem custom object class.\n   Other than those considerations, I'm not sure what the problem\n   could be.\n   But I am still not sure exactly what the problem is.  Are they\n   not able to enter more than 64 characters?  Or, if they do,\n   do only the first 64 characters get saved to CE?  Or is it just\n   a problem displaying them because they are entering values with\n   no spaces or word breaks and the values are going off the\n   screen?\n   If it *is* just a matter of changing the length of\n   Bp8Description in CE and whether we support it, the answer\n   is, yes, we support it - but like all such customizations,\n   the customer has too keep track of this change.  If they ever\n   upgrade their system and import a new BPF CE manifest\n   (ce_base.xml), it will reset the length of this property back\n   to the default (64) and they will have to go in and change it\n   back to 256 themselves manually.\n   2.\n   Yes.  This is a problem.  It looks like the whole section\n   (\"Step 2: Bundle code\") of the \"Web custom tool development\n   procedure\" section of the BPF Developer Guide is very much out\n   of date (even in the new 3.6.0 version) - going back to the\n   pre-product (pre-3.5.x) days when we distributed the actual\n   source code to customers.\n   Fortunately, none of the other parallel sections I looked at\n   seems to share this problem.  And the \"BPF Customization &\n   Integration Development.doc\" in the CODE_SAMPLES.zip that\n   accompanies the Developer Guide does contain the correct and\n   up-to-date procedure.\n   So, for now, I would point the customer to the sample code\n   and to that document.  Basically, they just need to compile\n   their servlet in a JAR file using whatever name they like for\n   the JAR and whatever internal packaging/directory structure\n   they like there - and then deploy their custom JAR in the\n   WEB-INF directory and make sure that their custom tool's JSP\n   references the servlet using the correct package structure and\n   naming.\n   Could you please create a documentation DTS for this issue in\n   the Developer Guide?  Many thanks.\n   *\n   I hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need more\n   information here and, if so, specify as precisely as you can\n   what that might be.\n   {ascii_value:133}which allowed us to communicate that the\n   customer issue was working as designed, however this was not\n   accepted. They came back with the problem that now seems to be\n   their desktop resolution. Currently the user's desktop has a\n   resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels and to display the BPF\n   interface correctly, it requires a higher resolution. I have\n   also attached a document that shows the behaviour.\n   The CSS communicated that this is working as designed and any\n   changes required need to submitted as a Software Enhancement\n   Proposal. This was also rejected. The customer feels that their\n   desktop resolution is enough and that a solution should be\n   found by FileNet.\n   Bottom Line:\n   We need an official response from BPF Engineering stating that\n   the seen behaviour is 'working as designed'.

If they do not have\n   access to\n   DHL, they will only see 3 values (WORK, TRAV, WMATL).\n   \n   I am logged in as the user maxadmin , who is in the security\n   group\n   maxadmin.

It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.\n\nIBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.\n\nHardware \n\nDataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].\n\nFor end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. \n\nFirmware \n\nBusinesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.\n\nEffective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:\n\n 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.\n    \n    \n 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.\n     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.\n     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.\n    \n    \n\nFirmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nFirmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nNote: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported. By using the information in this table, customers can effectively plan their firmware investment without any gaps in support.\n\nRelease Support Model GA date End-of-service date Comment 7.7.0

I like this new Android client. When can we expect to have the same for iOS? \nProjected availability for the iOS client remains 4Q 2014 \n\n\nQ4. Any Beta - like to get a preview? \nNo formal plans now, but we are looking at what type of beta options iOS8 may allow for us \n\n\nQ5. Does the new Traveler release fix the issue of not being able to see items in trash on iPhone? \n- This is an Android-only update \n- No Trash support yet for iOS or Android. High priority for 4Q 2014 availability though. \n\n\nQ6. For iOS devices, we need to periodically reset them. otherwise, they do not sync Inbox or calendar. Is this issue got fixed in this version? \nPer Apple, this should now be resolved if using iOS 7.1.2, with Traveler server v9 or later \n\n\nQ7. Is there Notebook support for iOS? \nNo notebook/journal for iOS either planned at this time \n\n\n\n\n\nBlackBerry \n\nQ8. What about Journals - Domino Lotus Journals. Will we see them eventually on Traveler on BlackBerry? \nRight now, Journal or Notebook support (across platforms) is not a high priority requirement right now. We get occasional reports but it hasn't bubbled to hitting the high-priority list. \n\n\nQ9. Do we have to have BES to use Traveler on BlackBerry device? \nNo. You can use a BES or be standalone. \n\n\nQ10. Is Traveler client available on BlackBerry apps? Like it's available for Android? \nThere is no specific Traveler Client. These are all built in to the normal OS. You just use a Traveler account. \n\n\nQ11. What BlackBerry models support Traveler 9.x.x? \nBlackBerry 10 supports Traveler straight off for mail and calendar. Todo's need version 10.2 or later. \n\n\nQ12. When will Memo (Notebook/Journal) synch be implemented for Blackberry 10? The BB KB article says \"The BlackBerry 10 smartphone does not synchronize Memos (Journal) with Notes Traveler using SyncML protocol due to Notes Traveler \nlimitation.\" \nMemo support is \"in the works\". No ETA at present. \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies \n\nQ13. Any tips on determining if a policy has been applied to a device? \n- The user dump shows the policy state \n- The Traveler admin ui for device security should also reflect policy status. A user dump will show if the Domino policy has actually been pushed to the mail \ndatabase for the user. \n- You can look into the mail database (using NotesPeek). Look there for a traveler specific profile document. \n\n\nQ14. How do you do the user dump? command syntax? \ntell traveler dump <userid> \nThe resulting log file will be in the ../traveler/logs/dumps directory \n\n\nQ15. If Adminp is involved how much of a time lag should you expect for a policy change to get applied? Any manually way to push it? \n- Traveler policies should get pushed automatically nightly once they are replicated to the mail servers. \n- You can manually push with Domino console. Command:  *  tell adminp pr tr on each mail server \n\n\n\nQ16. Do explicit policies take precedence over the default Device Settings? Are there issues with policies when Traveler is in a different Domino Domain? \nDomino Traveler policies do take precedence over default device setting. For different Domino domains you will need to define the policy in each Domain as adminp task on mail server push the policy to the users mail file at which point Traveler detects it. \n\n\nQ17. Has there been any security enhancement made to prevent information from a corporate email being copied and pasted into personal email. \nCopy and paste within email is controlled via a server policy \n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting \n\nQ18. Are other people have the carriage return issue on the new Android Traveler App? \nYes. We are already working on a fix. \n\n\nQ19. There's an issue with us having duplicate addresses. When we sync our address books, it seems to have duplicate addresses. Is there any relation to it with the version that we're running on or something with Traveler? \nWe don't have any known issues in that area at all. Open a PMR. You might have a 3rd party app that is trying to sync as well; we have seen some duplication issues from things like that. \n\n\nQ20. Per slide 4, we have run into issues with Android app running after download via the traveler site we have. We'd rather not get the app via Google Play. Has this been fixed? \nHow you download the application shouldn't matter as it is the same apk either way. If you have issues with the download from your server, then you possibly have some network issue that needs to be solved rather than an issue with the apk itself. \n\n\nQ21. It was a couple months ago with Galaxy S4 and believe me, nothing wrong with the server. The program downloaded just fine, but it didn't launch. \nYou'll need to open a PMR so that we can debug what is going on there. \n\n\nQ22. On calendar, if you click an appointment in the device calendar it will link you directly to the Calendar app. On Contacts there is nothing happening; therefore, you have to got manually to the Contacts app in order to change a Device contact. \nYes, that is the current behavior, on the list to improve going forward. \n\n\nQ23. Regarding issues with slowness to launch...  * love the new app on Android, but.....it's very slow to launch (slow as in 10 seconds to open mail)....and I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active \n * Same here with multiple devices, also slowness on Contacts app \n * I installed this on two phones and both phones took up to 30 seconds each time the mail app was opened. a Note and an S3 so I'd not consider those phones \"underpowered\". Traveler 9 on the two phones (S3 and Note) was slow enough to be unusable. Removing 9 and putting 8 back on instantly resolved the slowness. Slow as 30 seconds each time the mail app was opened from the home screen. Comments? \n * my email opens in sub-secs - response time is good\n\n\nSlowness improvements are in progress. Stay tuned for further updates \n\nRegarding the slowness to launch, we have had a few reported cases, and are continuing the investigation and reviewing reported cases. If you are able please open a PMR to report further slowness related issues with a TPR from the device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to and General Q&A \n\nQ24. Is the confirmation for external recipient feature still available in the new app? \nYes, no change to confirmation for external recipient behavior \n\n\nQ25. Are you able to add functionality to the Notes Traveler interface? \nDo you mean on the devices? if so, the answer is no as the apps aren't extendable \n\n\nQ26. Are they extendable or customizable on the server at all? \nThe server side (default settings, web admin, servlet pages) aren't extendable \n\n\nQ27a. On the one hand Traveler is recommended in extra domain for being able to upgrade it independent from the mailing environment. On the other hand using ID Vault does not support Cross Domain? \nRemember that Domino is \"future compatible\" on names.nsf versions, so you can upgrade that without updating the whole server \n\n\nQ27b. And what is the answer, if I am providing a central Traveler Cluster for many (Mail) Domains? \nIf you have multiple mail domains, you already have the ID vault cross domain issue, so having Traveler in another domain is only a real problem if you have all of your mails in one domain because if you have them in separate domains, you already have the ID vault problem. The people who own ID vault are aware of the issue and addressing it was mentioned at Connect 2014. \n\n\nQ28. We're running on 8.5.3 mail servers and applications, but our actual Traveler sits on a different domain. One of the consultants told me we could upgrade our Traveler to 9.0 without really upgrading all our environment to 9.0. Is that correct? \nYes. \n\n\nQ29. Is there any problem with the email coming in and out if your Traveler server is at a higher level than your mail servers? \nNo known issues at this time. That's actually how a lot of our customers deploy. They tend to upgrade their Traveler environment a little more quickly then maybe they do their mail servers. \n\n\nQ30. Transitioning from 853 to 9. Upgrading the version of Domino and then Traveler. Is there any issues with that? \nNo, there should be no known issues. The online doc will walk you through the update process. \n\n\nQ31. Can Traveler hopefully soon also use the personal names.nsf of a user's roaming profile instead of the contact copies in the mail database for synch? \nIf the roaming contacts are replicated into the servers contacts, then they would sync. Otherwise, they won't. \n\n\nQ32. Should \"tell traveler cleanup\" remove old entries from the LotusTraveler.nsf? \nIt will run reset for the users that are \"old\" and weren't cleanup previously, but depending on the reset operation, it may or many not clean up the nsf....it will clean the nsf, but many people think cleanup isn't cleaning up everything and those data are there for a valid reason....but you really shouldn't need to run cleanup as that should have been done automatically, so I would recommend opening a PMR rather than running the resets (directly or indirectly through cleanup). \n\n\nQ33. I am seeing old devices in the LotusTraveler.nsf like if a user wipes their device and reinstalls trav \nAnything with a security action will be left on purpose \n\n\nQ34. I have seen that many users in the lotustraveler.nsf deleted long time back has started appearing again. Please let me know how to do clean up and how to prevent . \nYou will need to open a PMR so that we can analyze what data is there and that you think shouldn't be so that we can give you a real answer on what to do next \n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Enhancement Requests & Roadmaps \n\nQ35. Is there any plan to be able to copy an email into a To Do? I can see one is able to add it to a calendar/event document. \nWe have that requirement already for creating a ToDo from the mail \n\n\nQ36. Is this Android update only available through the play store or will there be an update available from the Traveler server? \nThe short answer is PlayStore right now and through the server shortly. \n\n\nQ37. When will is the next planed server release? \n2014 4Q is still the plan \n\n\nQ38. What is schedule for the next IF? \nInterim Fixes for 9001 and 901 are imminent. Plan is on the order of days. \n\n\nQ39. Will there be any future Fix Packs for Traveler 8.5.3.3? \nWe can't comment directly on future plans as they are always subject to change. But if you look at the related to future device support page, you will notice that the new devices aren't on 8.5.3.3, so that means it is unlikely to get much and you should plan to upgrade (for new features, performance, fixes, etc.) http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577369 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577369] \n\n\n\nQ40. Is there any plans to add functionality to reserve rooms and resources? \nNot right now. That's not currently in plan. \n\n\nQ41. Any idea when Notebook will be supported in Traveler? \nNo current plans for Notebook/Journal support on Android \n\n\nQ42a. Is the Android Traveler app going to support multiple mail or calendar accounts for Traveler like the Apple device does now? \nMultiple accounts in the apps is a known requirement. You can do it at the device level with multiple accounts with their own Traveler setups. So, there is at least a partial option there now. \n\n\nQ42b. And what about mail-in databases? We use them heavily. \nThe second/other account can be any user (including one that is backed by a mail-in db). \nMail-in-dbs are available for the traveler client, just add a person document and webmail password for the mail-in-db an it will sync to a mobile device. \n\n\nQ43. Is there any plan to have a selective notification depending on email criteria such as a keyword in the subject line? I need my phone to ring when there is a keyword in the subject but not ring for any \"normal\" email. \nNo plan for notifications at that granular a level \n\n\nQ44. Will there be an Maas360 edition of Traveler app (currently they do e.g. not support encryption). Think that this would be good idea. \nMaas360 integration for Traveler on Android and iOS (once Traveler client available) are in progress, both high priority targets for delivery in 2014 \n\n\nQ45. Will you have support for either AirWatch or Soti along with MobileIron? \nRight now, our priorities around management integration with some of the different management vendors. We're initially right focusing on support for our IBM solution, which is Maas360. We do have support for MobileIron today, and we'll continue that going forward. Those are the top priorities right now. \n\nAirWatch is one that we've continued to look at and it's high on our priority list but there is no current plan to add support for AirWatch. \n\nNo, we have not looked at Soti yet. \n\n\nQ46. We are on the edge of rolling out Samsung Galaxy S5 phones. As you known there is the issue with the Menu button. We use MobileIron. Do you have any specific date when the MobileIron secure app will be available? \nAs you're probably aware, the app update that we just put out better addresses our compatibility with any of the devices that don't have a hard menu button on there. \n\nAs far as the MobileIron-enabled version of our latest app update, we are working with MobileIron on that now. There's a process that we go through with them where they wrap our apk and then that's made available through their MobileIron download site. We would expect that to be available pretty shortly but I don't have an exact date. We are working with them to try to get that out as soon as possible. What we try to do is coordinate our efforts so that as we put new app updates out, the MobileIron wrap version follows shortly. We just try to firm up our final delivery before giving something to them because that does require one-off QA from both us and them. \n\nLong story short. Should be available very shortly. \n\n\nQ47. Will the Show Local Calendar also be available in the MobileIron container client? \nI don't think there should be any issue with/ the show local calendar being able to show your local calendaring in your Traveler calendar. \n\nGood question. I think it should work. We'll have to get it back from MobileIron and see if it works. They block what they block. I think they only block things that we try and expose outside of their container. In general they let us read things but not write things, so I imagine it will work. \n\n\nQ48. We do experience when we sync, when we keep up the connection to the server, when we sync we experience a poor battery life on Android devices using push technology. So we suggest that our customer use scheduled synchronization (like every 15 minutes). Are there any plans to incorporate technology like cloud messaging to push or to send a message to the client so that it will run the sync when a new message arrives on the server? \n\nYes. So Google Cloud Messaging is the one we're working on now. Except it won't work with/ MobileIron. \n\nThe improved battery life is something that we continue to look at. As you mentioned, the options for scheduled sync or manual sync are kind of the options that are there today. Google Cloud messaging is the next piece that we're working on. We are actually trying to deliver that soon although the projection is 4Q. There are some server enhancements that we need to include as part of delivering that. Our next Traveler server update is targeted for 4Q. That is the direction we're going. \n\nHistorically MobileIron has blocked Google Messaging from its apps that it wraps. \n\nLet us go have some more further conversations with/ MobileIron about that and as to whether they have any plans to alleviate that restriction especially as we look to bring it forward with our Traveler app. \n\n\nQ49. When our users need to change their passwords (like on a scheduled basis). Whenever they change it on our Identity Management they need to change it on the client as well. Are there any plans to make certificate based authentication available on the IBM Traveler client? \nCertificate-based authentication is another one of those kind of high-priority requirements that we've had for a while. Right now we don't have plans to deliver that by the end of the year. The ETA for that is more targeted to the first half of 2015. \n\n\nSuggestions:  * Suggest to have \"Mark Unread\" in the Gesture actions as well ... and All Docs and Docs in multiple folders .... Android should be the mobile Notes Mail client. Same experience everywhere. \n * I agree that \"Mark Unread\" would be good in gesture actions \n * Suggestion to make more use of Hannover Menu and the slide in Navigator. Like in Contacts or ability to switch between mail/todo/cal\n\n\n\nAbout Open Mic Webcasts IBM Collaboration Solutions (Lotus) Support wants to help you take full advantage of your products.

Does anyone know if Traveler 9 will be required to support iOS 7 when it is released? \nA. We will be evaluating iOS 7 as soon as we can do beta testing. It is not known yet what is in there but for previous updates from Apple, we supported immediately \n\nQ. Is the Journal now available for iOS devices? \nA. No journal on iOS \n\nQ. When will the Android client have the ability to use a certificate for a proxy server? \nA. It's on the list of requirements.. Can't commit to anything now. \n\nQ. Customers are asking for sync of Notes ToDo to the native iOS reminders via EAS. \nA. Development evaluated use of reminder app for Notes ToDo, but it was not a good match against customer requirements, hence the To Do app. No plans to support reminders. \n\nQ. With Notes Traveler HA, documentation says that it will only support up to 10,000 devices per pool and I believe 12,000 per pool in Notes 9. Are there any plans to recommend beyond those limits? \nA. Those limits are where performance gets below what we acceptable. We are constantly working to improve performance and for each release will update with latest benchmark results. \n\nQ. Does Notes Traveler 9 or any upcoming release support multiple user profiles on a device? \nA. Apple devices currently support this. For Android not supported in v9. There is a requirement existing for Android, but no ETA. \n\nQ. Does Traveler support clustered mail environments...synching with cluster replica if primary mail server is down? Does this work if Traveler is setup in a separate domain with same OU? \nA. Yes, Traveler supports mail clusters. Fail over to backup mail servers should work when Notes Traveler and user's mail files are in different domains \n\n\nQ. We have a Unified Messaging product that uses a custom Extension Manager application on the Domino server to implement a Message Waiting Indicator (MWI). We rely on the EM_NSFADDTOFOLDER and EM_NSFMARKREAD notifications but are unable to generate these notifications when the message is processed through Traveler. Is this supported with Traveler? \nA. Traveler does not use the EM_NSFxxx fields. \n\nQ. Does the design of the mailbox need to be upgraded to v9 to support traveler 9? We have a custom mail template. \nA. No, mail DB design would not need to be updated for Traveler. \n\n\nQ. When setting up a complete new Traveler server infrastructure, do you recommend to create a Traveler server inside the productive Lotus Domino Domain OR in a separate new Lotus Domino Domain (that can be updated much faster to newer releases)? What should be considered? \nA. See this doc for info on separate vs one domain -> Supporting multiple Lotus Domino domains [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Administering+Lotus+Notes+Traveler+8.5.3#action=openDocument&res_title=Supporting_multiple_Lotus_Domino_domains_LNT853&content=pdcontent] \n\n\nQ. If Traveler 9 is in another Domino domain - would Mail encryption still work on the device? \nA. Domino does not support ID Vault in cross domain when sending emails. But if the ID file is in the user's mail file cross domain sending encryption should work. \n\nQ. Can coexist Traveler servers running Domino 853 and 9 in the same Domain? \nA. Yes, no issues with different versions in same or different domains. But can not have different versions in the same HA pool. \n\n\nQ. How are marked read events propagated to the Domino server from Traveler? \nA. The unread marks just updates the Domino unread labels \n\nQ. If we have Traveler running on Windows Server 2003 we would first have to upgrade the server 2008 or higher before we can upgrade to Domino\\Traveler 9? \nA. Yes. Need to upgrade OS to supported release first. Migration from unsupported OS documented here for Traveler --> Moving IBM Notes Traveler to a new server [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Administering+IBM+Notes+Traveler+9#action=openDocument&res_title=Moving_IBM_Notes_Traveler_to_a_new_server_A9&content=pdcontent] \n\n\nQ. I see Windows 2003 is no longer supported for installation. I see Windows 2012. But, can I install on Windows 2008? \nA. Yes, Windows 2008 still supported \n\n\nQ. Can we run Traveler 9 while still running 8.5.3 Mail servers? \nA. Yes. \n\nQ. Would all the mail servers in a cluster need to be on Domino 9 then, if we want Traveler on V 9? \nA. No, mail servers do not have to be upgraded to Domino 9. Only the Domino server that is hosting the Traveler 9 component Mail servers can be any version 7.0.2 or later, just the Domino server running Traveler needs to be at same level as Traveler. \n\nQ. Is RedHat 6 supported? \nA. Yes. \n\nQ. Domino+Traveler 9 is supported in Win2003 64 bits? \nA. The system requirement page has the OS supported for notes Traveler 9.0 \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038193 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038193] \n\nQ. Our Traveler is currently in same domain as mail servers, if I move Traveler to a separate domain and use Directory Assistance what affect will that have on devices, for example will they need to prime sync? are there other issue I need to be aware of? \nA. No issues - as long as the Traveler server still can access the mail DBs with Manager access. The main limitation is that ID Vault will not work. \n\nAs long as your underlying data directory is not lost (specifically the Traveler\\ntsdb directory) then end users would not notice. If you run Traveler in a different domain, be aware of the vaulted ID issue with encrypted mail since Domino does not support ID vault access from other domains. And see this document -> Supporting multiple IBM Domino domains [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Administering+IBM+Notes+Traveler+9#action=openDocument&res_title=Supporting_multiple_IBM_Domino_domains_A9&content=pdcontent]. \n\n\nQ. We have a BES10 server and IBM Domino/Traveler 9 environment and are in a process of upgrading our BlackBerry devices to BB10. We are experiencing lots of problems with devices (battery life, excessive data usage, issues with email delays). After speaking to our wireless support and doing some investigation we suspect that at least part of these problems can be attributed to the environment and possibly Traveler (people using Exchange do not experience these problems). Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this from the Traveler perspective? \nA. There are no current known battery life, excessive data usage, issues w/ e-mails delays when using BES 10, BB10, w/ Traveler v9 ... best next step would be to open PMR, have IBM support deep dive on environment/issues. \n\n\nQ. What considerations are needed if you want to upgrade to Traveler 9 but have R8.5.3 mail servers? (New release of Domino install (to R9) will want to update system files like NAMES.NSF) \nA. There is not problem running Notes Traveler 9.0 with back level (8.5.3) mail servers \n\nQ. What happens when you upgrade the Domino server to R9? How will those upgraded db's react to the rest of the R8.5.3 environment? \nA. You don't have to upgrade the names.nsf template on the new 9.0 Notes Traveler server. You would lose some access to some new setting fields for Notes Traveler \n\nQ. Any support for OOO? \nA. OOO support is available today for Windows Phone devices with Traveler v9. OOO for iOS/Android currently targeted for summer release (time line subject to change), but very high priority! :) \n\nQ. On BlackBerry 10, OOO should work with BES10.1 and BBOS10.1. \nA. Correct. OOO is also there today for BlackBerry \n\nQ. What is the minimum Domino release on Mail Servers ? I have some affiliates still using release Domino 6.5, should it work with Traveler 9.0 ? \nA. Mail server minimum is 7.0.2 with at least 6.5 mail template \n\n\nQ. Does Traveler 9 support encrypted e-mail on BB10? \nA. The BB10 devices email client currently do not support Domino encrypted email \n\nQ. Do you need BES in order for BlackBerry devices to work with Traveler? \nA. You do not need the old BES server and you do not have to have a BES10 either. But if you run a BES10, you can provision your BB10 to have a personal and a work perimeter to enhance security. \n\nBES is not 'required' to use a BB10 device with Traveler \n\nDirect Connect is possible to the Traveler Server from BB10 devices \n\nBoth connection types set-up for BB10 is included in the Traveler Wiki under using BB \n\nQ. Does Traveler 9.0 support links to database documents ? \nA. There is some doc link support starting before 9.0, but the Domino Link has to be addressable from the device. There are a number of caveats so it might not work the way you want it to. Please read this first -> Converting Notes document links to web links [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Administering+IBM+Notes+Traveler+9#action=openDocument&res_title=Converting_Notes_document_links_to_web_links_A9&content=pdcontent] \n\nQ. Has anyone experience with Web Application Firewall in front of the Traveler server. What are the URL or methods to accept ? I haven't found much documentation on that item \nA. If supporting migrated devices also allow /servlet/traveler* \n\nQ. Really need \"Search on the server\" \nA. It is a requirement and being considered for future release \n\nQ. NO meeting chair actions from device possible, is that valid for all kind of devices? or only Windows phone? \nA.Only Windows Phone, RT, Pro for now. Likely will come eventually. \n\nQ. Is there a way to push a password to a device like you can do for BES? \nA. Not with Notes Traveler since it is not a full MDM \n\nQ. Can you tell me if new traveler can change de date or time to the meetings ? \nA. Yes for Apple, Android, BB10 - but no for Windows Phone/RT/Pro at this time \n\nQ. During the BES 10 setup we found that because we're Domino shop (not integrated with Active Directory) the only way to activate BB10 device is to use the AD user login (domainame\\userlogin) in the email address field. If we use email address to activate a device the process doesn't work. I was told that this is because we are using Traveler. RIM doesn't seem to have sufficient knowledge of Traveler/Domino environment. I am curious if other people have the same experience with the BB10 setup or we are alone here. Lots of problems with BB10. \nA. No. the BES10 set-up and administration is not \"because you are using Traveler\". Its dependency on AD, if any, is unrelated to Traveler \n\nQ. Is there a possibility to add mail footers to emails sent from a smartphone via Traveler? \nA. Not by Notes Traveler, but there is Domino disclaimer can add messages to all emails sent \n\nQ. Do BB10 devices work with Traveler 8.5x + BES 10 ? \nA. The first IBM Traveler release that supports BB10 devices is 9.0 (no prior releases). Also, it might connect depending on what version of 8 you are running, but 9 is the supported version and had all testing and fixes for BB10 in that level, not back ported \n\nQ. Does Traveler 9 allow the \"prevent copying\" setting in Notes to work on iOS and Android devices? In 8.5.3 You just get a message saying the content has to be viewed in a Notes client. \nA. Prevent copying did not change for 9.0, we are looking at enhancing this support in future \n\nQ. How does one get to the OOO on the iPhone? \nA. Currently it is not supported, but coming in a future release \n\n\nQ. Regarding Android Traveler client & MDM vendors. Can't use the Android Lotus Traveler client w/ MDM. Is there a plan to allow MDMs to access the backend so they can be controlled, so we don't have to use touch tone? \nA. Not yet, but working towards it. We have been working with some of the MDM providers to try to have them better integrate with us. When we went to the XPages WebAdmin, we are going to try and also have a REST API base for management for various things, because that's a logical extension of doing that and then anybody, including MDM providers, would have access to those REST APIs in order to do that. \n\n\nQ. We have a Windows 2008 64-bit 8.5.3 UP2 shop. Strictly Android & iOS at the moment. Is it worthwhile for us to go to version 9 at this point (for our shop). Most new features seem for other platforms. \nA. Potentially for the migration thing mentioned earlier for 8.5.3 to 9.0 where you're going to have to take an outage, it could be advantageous to go 9.0 now so you would have basically a smaller outage before you get as many devices. Most of the new features, you are correct, are for other device platforms so if you're not going to use those there's not an overly compelling reason to pick up new features but if you want to have Linux 64 on Domino you would have to go to 9, or some of the other features if you want the platform support. But as far as Traveler features specifically, if you're not using the new features there's not a whole lot in there that would force you to go up. \n\n\nWhen we had the Upgrade Packs (1 & 2) there were some considerable performance fixes that also went into those versions so we have been kind of pushing customers to get up to those versions even if they're not running HA. There have been some performance enhancements for 9 but it wasn't like the level of what we did for those Upgrade Packs. \n\n\nQ. Does it make sense to go to HA first before upgrading? Or set up everything in 9 and then go to HA? \nA. Set up on 9 and then go to HA. \n\nQ. Has anyone seen issues with Apple devices uploading attachments to 9? Downloading seems to have no problems. \nA. Check the HTTP Post limit set on the Domino HTTP on the traveler server. Server document there are settings for how big you can allow the post data to be. \n\nQ. At this time it seems that IBM is leading with it's own Traveler client on Android devices. With the success of Samsung, is there any consideration into supporting Samsung SAFE for native email on devices? \nA. Not at this time. To push for that, contact Notes Traveler Product Manager, Eric Otchet. \n\n\nQ. Guidelines for checking the Traveler logs? \nA. Main information is in the headers at the log file at the top. \n\nQ. What is support for To Dos and Notebook Journal functionality on BlackBerry 10 devices? \nA. At this time those are currently not supported on BlackBerry 10 devices. It's just Mail, Calendar and Contacts. \n\nQ. A feature with older BlackBerry devices would allow you to delete email locally on the handheld but still keep them on the server, and the same for read/unread marks. Is that something that's available with Active Sync that could be supported in the future? \nA. It is not supported now, the Active Sync protocol does not have an exact support for that, but if the device wanted to do the soft delete on the device it could just soft delete and not tell the server about the delete. \n\n\nQ. Any issues with SSO? Any concerns with how Traveler gets incorporated? From a security standpoint we'd be able to have users hit a portal, log in with the network account and depending on what access their granted, it can pass their user name and password so they don't even have to know, for example, their Web mail password which is used for Traveler. Is that going to be a foreseen issue? \nA. So, Domino of course has the single sign-on across the HTTPs that you would want enabled so it wouldn't have to authenticate depending on where it got sprayed to, but anything beyond that level would be a 3rd-party integration or potentially into the Domino Directory Assistance setup and not specific to Traveler itself. \n\nQ. Can you tell us what we might be able to expect from these newly supported devices regarding self-signed certificates? \nA. It will vary across the devices. Windows Phone is more tolerant of the self-signed certificates than the tablets are. There are ways that you can run cert utils and import the certificates to then use the self-signed certificates on the Windows tablet devices. In general, we recommend that you still have a real signed cert, even if you get one of the cheap ones so that it's there. \n\n\nFor more information about our Open Mic webcasts, visit the IBM Collaboration Solutions Support Open Mics [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/support/lotus-open-mics/] page. \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Tabs missing for BlackBerry & Windows Phone on Security [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21642384]\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PUBLICATION DATE\n 2013/4/9",

What does the user get presented with if they try to access a corrupt database? \n\nA: The Corrupt Database Collector does not take corrupt databases off-line. On database open, when the automatic capture of corrupt databases is enabled, a copy will be made of databases that are marked corrupt. The database will be left in place to be automatically or explicitly fixed up. \n\nWhat a user sees will vary. If you have the database open and do not encounter any corruption, everything may work as you expect. If your activity takes you into the corruption, you will see failures. If you do not have the database open, then you may find you cannot open it because a FIXUP is being run on the database. You may also get an error opening the database if another user has the database open. If you are unable to run FIXUP on the database or if automatic FIXUP is enabled for the database, it may be taken offline, fixed up and brought back online. \n\n\n\n\nQ: At Lotusphere 2011, there was some indication that changes might be coming regarding separating view indexes from the NSF, can anyone talk about that? \n\nA: We are always looking to add value and reduce TCO for Domino. Removing view indexes from the main NSF containing the data documents and putting them into another NSF store in a potentially different location than the main NSF file is being researched as to the measurable benefits. There has been no commitment yet for this enhancement in RNext, but is still under research/discussion. \n\n\n\n\nQ: When I run maintenance tasks on Notes databases, the transaction logs will be written and I receive an error message that the \"Log File is Full\". Will this also happen if I bring the server offline to run the maintenance tasks? \n\nA: If you are seeing log file full errors, then you should open a PMR. Running the maintenance tasks with the server down may reduce the chance of a log file full, but depending on the root cause, there are no guarantees you won't see one. \n\n\n\n\nQ: How can we upgrade the folder design (ie - load convert -u) while the mail files are 99% usage but we are not allowed by corporate policy to relax the existing mail quota? Are database quotas hard number, even preventing any server maintenance tasks? \n\nA: The maintenance tasks will still run \n\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a server command that will identify and record all of the template versions of mail files on a server? \n\nA: You can build your own view in the Catalog.nsf to show all files by the templates. You can also look in the DbInheritTemplateName and DbTemplateName fields. \n\n\n\n\nQ: My Notes mail file (based on 8.0.1 template) occasionally reverts to the 6.5.4 design. It only ever happens in one server replica at a time so deleting the icon from the workspace and 'finding replica' on its cluster server resolves the display problem. This has happened about three times over the past 3-4 months. What could be the cause? \n\nA: There must be a 6.5.4 template on the server somewhere that is being used to replace the design. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Are there any known issues when upgrading custom Domino applications from version 7.x to 8.x? \n\nA: This is a question that we get when upgrading any version to any version. Make sure that you are running the latest release as there are always improvements to bugs and performance. You can check for specific bug fixes in the Fix List database [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/Public?OpenView]. Every custom application is completely unique and it may work one way in the basic client and another way in the standard client or on the web. You must test all your custom apps because there is really no way for us to predict how your custom app might behave in a different version, given the infinite combination of design elements. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We get an error message when setting the Out Of Office agent \"Only plain text can be used in this type of field\". We thought there was a problem with the OOO profile, so we replaced that, all forms, all subforms, and all database scripts, but we still get the same error on user's mail file. Any suggestions? \n\nA: We have not seen that error before. Is your mail file customized, and if so, in what capacity? One guess is that someone is trying to paste in an emoticon or picture into a text field. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Are there any tools/methods to remove '\"local access protection\" on NSFs that were provided from an outside source when we were not provided the .ID file and/or password? \n\nA: There is not a way to access local access protection without the ID file. It must be decrypted before sending it to view it locally. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a way to access and detach a \"File\" resource from an NSF using LotusScript running on a Notes client? \n\nA: Yes, you can use the LS NotesNoteCollection to get handle to any design element, including resources. \n\n\n\n\nQ: What server task is responsible for purging deletion stubs? \n\nA: This action happens on database open. \n\nFollow-up Q: Does the purge use a non-public API call? I've found that getModifiedNoteTable can return an error if there is a really huge number (3+ million!) of stubs and I don't know of any other way to get the stubs. \n\nA: The purge happens via an internal call and we check once a day to see if we should try a purge. The getModifiedNoteTable failure is due to the fragmentation in the note ids being returned. Currently we don't have an option to work around that. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Is there any issue with compacting log.nsf of the server? It increases and we need to recreate it in order to recovery its percentage used. We use 8.5.2 FP1 and 8.5.1 FP2. \n\nA: You can run in-place compact with the server running without issue. Or you can run compact with the server down using ncompact. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We are migrating from 7.0.3 to 8.5.2. Regarding overall capacity document counts, are they handled better in 8.5.2? We currently seem to have a lot of corruption using version R7. \n\nA: In general, as we go through each release, we improve our corruption detection. We never expect when you move from one major release to the next that we are going to corrupt data. We would encourage you to move from R7 to 8.5.2FP1. \n\nWhen upgrading from 7.x, there are two important disk space saving features: \n\n1. Data compression was introduced in 8.0.1. You have to be at minimal ODS 48 to enable data compression. There are two options. One is to compress just the design documents and the other is to compress the data documents. We use LZ1 compression on the body of documents. We see 30-50% disk savings on ODS 48.LZ1 should be enabled on attachments as well. \n\n2. In 8.5 we introduced Domino Attachment and Object Service (DAOS). DAOS saves significant space at the file level by sharing data identified as identical between databases (applications). For more information, see The new Lotus Domino attachment and object service [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/domino-green/]. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We are on version 6.5 and moving our servers to 8.5.1. Are there any issues with running ODS 43 for an extended amount of time on an 8.5.1 server? \n\nA: ODS 43 is supported and we are not aware of any issues. Administrators like the fact that they did not have to upgrade the ODS at the same time during a major upgrade. However, you would not get the performance features until you upgraded to the new ODS version. \n\n\n\n\nQ: When an attachment is in DAOS and a database replicates to a cluster member, if there are multiple databases with the same attachment, is the attachment only sent once to the clustermate? \n\nA: DAOS is independent whether or not it is participating in a cluster. In the case of when the destination has DAOS enabled, the replication will phone ahead that you already had this attachment in your DAOS repository. If so, the attachment will not be retransmitted. \n\n\n\n\nQ: My mail file is not being compacted when using compact -c with the 8.5.1FP5 server running. \n\nA: On occasion, when running compact -c with the server running, and new mail arrives for that mail file while the database is being modified, that can cancel the compact operation. Try to bring the server down and then compact the database to see if the size shrinks as we would expect. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We have concerns about old replicas polluting our databases after the deletion stubs are purged. Are there any best practices for protecting our databases from such occurrences? \n\nA: There is a new replication option feature coming in Domino 8.5.3 called Purge Integration Replication Control (PIRC). PIRC is a replication option that will prevent documents from replicating back into a database older than the purge interval. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a way to analyze a database to reduce the index size? \n\nA: You can issue the command \"show database <database name>\" on the server console to see all of the views that are currently built and their size in the database. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We recently upgraded 8.0.1 to 8.5.2 on the client. We run FIXUP, UPDALL, and COMPACT once a week. We have a couple of users that never see any free space when deleting mail from the trash and archiving documents. \n\nA: This should be handled automatically. With the server running, try a compact -B command. This will have a better chance of succeeding. There are also hotfixes in later fix packs for issues that started in 8.5 using compact -B. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We see that some NLO files are deleted but we are not sure why they are being deleted. All of the messages get sent to an archive database which is DAOS enabled. \n\nA: As the documents are migrated to the archive NSF, the reference count should go down, as they are removed from the primary NSF, but should go back up as they are deposited in the archive. It should end up being the same number of references at the end. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We have two clustered 32-bit 7.0.4 servers on Windows 2003 server. Our goal is to move to two clustered 64-bit servers on Windows 2008. What is the best practice for moving databases over to the new system considering that I have two new servers? \n\nA: Because you are running Windows 2003, which is supported with Domino 8.5.2, I would upgrade the servers in place and make sure the upgrade is successful. When you are ready to move to the new hardware, bring one of the clustermates down and copy everything over into the same location on disk to your current drive mapping. Then rerun the installation once all of the data is moved. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We are going to change our Notes topology infrastructure from decentralized to centralized. I want to put all of our Domino 8.5.1 servers in the data center. We are concerned about the backups for information. What recommendations do you have for running compact before I backup all of the information? \n\nA: You could upgrade to ODS 48 and take advantage of data compression to get the files to a smaller size. The backups would be a lot easier using data compression. It is always a good idea to bring the machines down and run FIXUP and initialize one last backup and then move the data back into the data center. For running compact, using compact -d will discard the views and -n for design and -v for data compression. \n\n\n\n\nQ: We have a clustered environment and need to run compact -c. Is there another way to take a database offline without bringing down the server? \n\nA: For clustered servers, our recommended best practice is to bring the server down and then run compact. You will get through multiple compactions faster with the server down. However, in the Admin client there is an option to take the database offline. \n\n\n\n\nQ: All of our mail users have Designer access but our users are not able to run compact by going into application properties. The compact button is greyed out. Why is this occurring? \n\nA: This is by design, but we have gotten the request before for users with Designer or Editor access to be able to run compact. We have had discussions about users having quotas assigned and if someone is near quota and has freed up space, compact should happen automatically on the back-end for them without any intervention. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor upcoming events, or Q&As from past events, see the Lotus Technical Exchange Webcasts [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/support/supp_tech_exch.html] page.",
      "STERLINGPRI TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Oracle 9i Certification for DCS 6.2 SP2 \n\nSYMPTOM\nPART: Outbound 5.0.1 SP2 DCS\n\nOracle 9i Certification for DCS 6.2 SP2\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUpdated on 11/7/2003:\nDCS 6.2 SP3 is intended to support Oracle 9.2 database server. Recently, oracle has announced extending support on oracle 8.1.7 by 1 year (i.e. until end of next year). Customers have stopped following us for 6.2 SP3 release after this announcement. We want to take this opportunity to certify SP3 on 8.1.7 database server. This means, that 6.2 SP3 release will work with both 9.2 server and 8.1.7 server. This will allow customers to upgrade to SP3 in phases (i.e. first upgrade app and then upgrade database server). And, we expect to obsolete SP2 quicker. We do not anticipate any issue in this certification because oracle supports 9.2 client with 8.1.7 server. This certification is expected to be a 1 week effort and we are targeting to announce DCS 6.2 SP3 release by end of next week (i.e. 11/14). \n\nUpdated 10/10/2003:\n1. Oracle 9i database server : Can it be on AIX 5L ? \nWe dont see any issue on going with AIX 5L for oracle 9i. You can upgrade your database server with ORacle 9i and AIX 5L. \n2. Moving App server to AIX 5L \nOur application is a 32 bit application. AIX 5L is a 64 bit OS. However, we had several conversations with IBM regarding running 32 bit application on AIX 5L. IBM mentioned that they did not had any known issues in running a 32 bit application. Based on this information, we already have one customer currently in production (with 8 warehouses) running AIX 5L with WMS 6.2. Hence, we dont see this as an issue. However, we recommend that you talk to your IBM support before taking this decision.\n3. Are there any plans to compile WMS 6.2 with 64 bit Oracle 9i client ?\nOur next generation WMS (WMS 7.0) will be completely compatible with Oracle 9i, server and client side. Currently, there are no plans to make WMS 6.2 IBM/HP compatible with 64 bit Oracle 9i client. We expect our 6.2 customers to run 8.1.7.4 client with 9i server.\n4. Rule based versus cost based optimization :\nOur next generation WMS (WMS 7.0) uses only cost based optimization and not rule based. There are no plans to change WMS 6.2 from rule based to cost based optimization.\n5. To apply 6.2 SP3, do we have to be on the latest HF ?\nYes. You should upgrade to the latest HF before applying the 6.2 SP3. However, our hot fixes are cumulative and you dont have to apply all hot fixes one by one. If you apply the latest, it will automatically apply all the previous ones.\n6. When is 6.2 SP3 scheduled for release ?\nIt is scheduled for release by around 1st week of November 2003. This is tentative schedule. I will communicate if there are any changes to the schedule. We dont expect any change to this schedule, unless we hit some major issue in our current testing process.\n\nUpdated 10/7/2003:\nOracle 9i certification for DCS 6.2 SP2 in mid-November of 2003.\n\nCustomers will need to upgrade to 6.2 SP3 and Oracle 9i at the same time. We have not tested 6.2 SP3(Sun version) with the Oracle 8.1.7 database.\n\nHowever, if you want to reduce the risk, you should first apply the latest 6.2 SP2 hotfix first. The only difference between the latest 6.2 SP2 HF (the one before 6.2 SP3) and 6.2 SP3 is that the 6.2 SP3 executables are compiled with Oracle 9i client libraries. There is no change in any functionality/logic.\n\nRelated info:\nUpdate 9/15/2003 :\n================\nCurrent plan is \"to support the 9i server but the clients will need to be 8.1.7.4\"\nYantra to release \"compatibility with 9i server and maintain all programs to connect thru' Oracle Client to be 8.1.7.4\" \n\nReason / Explanation :\n================\nThe work around is because of limitations on Oracle and not Yantra.\nOracle does not provide 9i client libraries for 32 bit m/c on HP and IBM. Oracle provides this only for SUN.\nHence, issue is mainly for HP and IBM customers and not for SUN customers.\n\nOracle is not releasing oracle 9i on 32bit HP-UX and 32bit IBM-AIX platforms. \nIf our customer(s) can influence oracle to release 9i on 32bit OS then Yantra can release DCS 6.2 with 9i client.\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n PRI49190 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n \n\nFact",

When installing Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 1 code, I'm getting \"unable to update JVM type\". \nCurrently there is a JVM hotfix available for this issue. The hotfix will also resolve the issue with other processes running. It will also resolve an issue that occurs at times if you re-run the 901FP1 installer, it could lead to other unexpected problems. So the roadmap from 9.0.1 is to request and apply the hotfix that's available through Support, and then apply Fix Pack 1. \n\n\nQ1b. Is the JVM hotfix ready or will it take some time once I request? \nIt's currently available for Win 64-bit or 32-bit. \n * Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 1 installer returns \"WARNING: JVM was not upgraded\" message [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675089] (technote 1675089)\n\n * Note:\n * \n\n\n\nQ2. What template version should the mail files be at when upgrading to Domino 9 (mail server)?  * Up to you and your plans to upgrade the Notes client. Domino can be upgraded to 9.0.1 Fix Pack 1 and then you can upgrade Notes clients at a later time and at that point decide what Mail template you would like to use. \n * Typically the version chain of command would go Server >= Client >= Template. Usually it's best to not have a client using a higher template version, but clients and servers and certainly handle older templates. \n * This should help you with the planning - Supported configurations for IBM Notes & Domino 9.x [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21628675] (technote 1628675)\n\n\n\nQ3. When upgrading on an AIX box, do you follow the documentation for 8.5.3? Is it exactly the same? \nJust double-check supported AIX Versions \n * \n * Index of system requirements for Notes, Domino, Domino Administrator, Domino Designer & Notes Traveler\n\n\n\nQ4. Is directly upgrading from Domino 7.x to Domino 9.0.1 supported? \nOnly thing to be careful about is OS support. When jumping from 7.0x to 9.0x, many times the OS that the 7.0.x was running on is not supported. \n\n\nQ5. I am on 8.5.3 Fix Pack 6. Can I just upgrade to 9.0.1? \nYes, you can upgrade to 9.0.1. \n\n\nQ6. Going from 8.5.2 to 9.0.1. We'd load 9.0.1 and do a Fix Pack and we should be good to go from that point? \nYes. Since Fix Pack 1 is the latest maintenance release that we have you would upgrade 901 and then apply the Fix Pack on top of it. \n\n\nQ7. We're currently running 8.5.2 Domino on IBM i. When we upgrade to 9.0.1, will all of our clients be able to be managed, in the newer version of Domino, while we're in the process of upgrading clients? \nYes. You can upgrade your servers and not do anything else and your clients will still be accessing Domino just fine. \n\n\nQ8. I've very recently taken over Domino administration for my program and I got about 1/2 hour introduction before I had to run it. We've got to apply Fix Pack 1 to 9.0. We're running Windows 2000 server. I can't find any information on install instructions. I'm looking for one basic document with basic steps on how to apply a Fix Pack. \nIt really is that simple. All you have to do is (1) Put the executable on your server, (2) down your server, (3) run the executable. Then it's going to take you through a nice easy wizard that will ask you a couple questions. It's going to look for the location of your Domino server. It should find that from the registry. So assuming your Domino server is installed properly, then it will be able to locate the installation path/directory of your server and it literally is five clicks later and your Fix Pack is installed. \n\nNote: Since you're new to Domino, just FYI that to uninstall a Fix Pack, you just run the same executable and it's smart enough to revert. \n\n\nQ9. I have found on many of my Windows servers, when I'm going to do an upgrade or a Fix Pack, I am setting the Windows services to manual and rebooting server so there's no hook on the Domino server, but I've found that I need to rename nnotes.dll and ndgts.dll or else the upgrade will fail.  * I've seen this before. It's usually the Windows Management Service. You can find the Process Explorer (there's a SysInternal tool that you can load on your machine). You bring everything down, run Process Explorer, and then you search to see who has nlnotes in use and quit that (e.g, something like your Backup service). \n\n * In some cases it's the Windows Mgmt service. I've been able to go into registry, search for and delete every reference to notesstat and reboot, then that Windows Mgmt serivce doesn't access it anymore and I'm able to run all my installs just fine. I've tried stopping that service and that works as well, but what you want to do if you end up stopping the Windows Mgmt service and you run your install, you're still going to want to reboot your machine because I've found that the machine will actually reboot itself some times even though you maybe paused that service and restarted it, Windows doesn't like that you do that. We're still trying to determine why that happens. (Note: Regarding deleting the notesstat references, when you run the install, it will put all of those back in.)\n\n\n\nQ10a. For upgrading your address book, we have about 60 servers we plan to upgrade over a year. Is it fine to upgrade the address book on your Hub servers and leave it as template 9? Will it affect any other severs when it's replicated across?  * It shouldn't. Take a look at the 8.5.3 cookbook [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/UC1_TableofContents.htm], all the basic principles apply to 9x. I like to upgrade my Admin server to 9.0.1x and let it be the one that takes the new design in the names.nsf, and I let that replicate freely out in our internal development domains where we have down-level 6.5.6, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5.x servers. I let that template go to all of those servers and it works just fine. \n\n * Now in some enterprises, one thing you have to be aware when you're going to a new major release of a template, is that there's two critical view design changes that some times can happen - ($Users) and ($ServerAccess). If you have a very large names.nsf with lots of users, when that design replicates to one of the other servers, those views have to be totally rebuilt on the next access. It could take some time to rebuild those views, so if anyone is trying to access the servers while the views are being rebuilt, they'll get denied because they have to be there to do authentication. \n\n * So if you don't have that many users (like less than tens of thousands), then everything should be just fine and the views should get rebuilt pretty quick, just a little blip so do it at night. I refer to this as an uncontrolled rollout where you just let the design roll out. There's a way to do a more controlled rollout described in the cookbook. where you bring down the server and pull over the new design from the other server and then do the Updall Processing. Down-level support on servers with the latest mail templates is something we always test for and make sure it works OK. \n\n\n\nQ10b. When I'm busy upgrading the next servers and they already have the v9 template, during the upgrade it asks \"Do you want to upgrade your address book.\" Should I say yes or no to that option? \nWhat I like to do, is there's a setting \"Refresh Design on Admin server database only.\" I like to check that to turn that on. So that all it needs to do is occur on the Admin server of the Domino Directory, which is usually your Admin server. And I only like to replace the design there. There's no sense to ping-ponging it all over the place and just let it replicate out from your Admin server. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nDomino on 64-bit platforms \n\nQ11. Is 32-bit Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 1 officially supported on 64-bit Win2012 R2 (VM)? \nYes, that is supported \n\n\nQ12. I have a 32-bit Domino installation that I would to install a 64-bit Windows 2012 R2 server. Is that officially supported? \nYes, you can run 32-bit Domino on a 64-bit Windows machine. You need to be at 9.0.1 or 8.5.3 Fix Pack 5 (or later). \n * \n * Domino support for Windows Server 2012\n * \n\n\n\nQ13. Is there something important to consider when upgrading from Domino 8.5.3 32-bit Linux to Domino 9.0.1 64-bit Linux? I am thinking of DAOS, translog, etc.?  * Not concerning DAOS and TRANSLOG; however, all views and all FT indexes will be rebuilt on first access.. So you should try and get that done before starting Domino 9.0.1 the first time.\n\n * DBMT task is great for getting that done in timely fashion\n\n\n\nQ14. I need to migrate Lotus Domino 32-bit 8.5.3 FP3 physical server to virtual machine Windows 2008 SP2 Lotus Domino 8.5.3 FP6 64-bit. 32 bit program files folder having so many customized DLL\u2019s. May I move full Lotus\\Notes folder to Windows 2008 server and then run 64-bit server, will it work? \n\n-> Steps to upgrade a 32-bit Domino server to 64-bit server on Windows platform [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506430] (technote 1506430) \n * The 32-bit .dlls are very likely not going to work with a 64-bit version of Domino. Contact the vendor/developer of these 3rd party .dlls and obtain a 64-bit compliant version of each one. May be worth asking if you still need those .dlls at all. \n\n * If you are upgrading an application server, make sure and test your LotusScript agents on the 64-bit system. We got hit with some issues from older agents that had to be altered for 64-bit systems to run correctly.\n\n * Upgrading from 32 to 64-bit, make sure to check compatibility of 3rd party apps like anti-virus, backup software, and monitoring tools. \n * Also check compatibility of any connectors like SQL, DB2, etc.\n\n\n\nQ15. We're upgrading from 8.5.3 32-bit to Domino 9 64bit? Do I have to uninstall all my Fix Packs at 8.5.3, install 8.5.3 64-bit, and then upgrade to Domino 9? What do you recommend? As long as the OS that you're on currently supports 64-bit, you should be able to go directly to 9.0 and install 64-bit Domino right on top of Domino 8.5.3 32-bit. \n\nNote:  * Any time you go from 32-bit to 64-bit, all of your view indexes currently built are going to have to be rebuilt on first access and all your full-text indexes are going to get rebuilt. So what I like to do is after I've done an upgrade from 32-to 64 is either run Updall against everything (which will rebuild all the currently built views and full-text indexes) (in 901 you could actually use the DBMT task to do that as well (more efficiently too). \n\n * After upgrade to 901, I'll usually issue DBMT -Updall Threads 8 (8 for if I have 8 processor threads) . I always do my ODS conversion early as well (in 9.0.1 there's a new ODS 52). So if going to 9.0.1, you would set CREATE_R9_DATABASES=1. And also on that DBMT command line w/ the -Updall Threads 8, I'd also do a -Compact Threads 8 and let that go through everything and once that's complete you should be able to start your server and be good to go. \n\n\n\nQ16. I am in a position to upgrade 32-bit Lotus Domino from Windows 2003 to Lotus Domino 64-bit on Windows 2008, in 32-bit Lotus Domino. I am finding JVM out of memory issues more. If I migrate to 64-bit, will it resolve? \nCan't say for sure but migrating to 64-bit is certainly the direction we are encouraging and doing so may give you some relief. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\niNotes & Notes Traveler \n\nQ17. We're running Traveler 8.5.3 on a Windows Domino server. Any issues with that or will it be backwards compatible as well? \nThe Traveler server version should match the Domino server version. But if you're just upgrading the users' mail server, then your Traveler server doesn't have to match the backend. \n\n\nQ18a. We currently have Traveler and our mail on one server. We have to migrate the whole thing off and in doing so we want to split our mail onto a separate server. I'm running in to some issues because the mail. I did set up a new server for mail and migrated a couple mailboxes but the mail is still going through the original server. \nYou created a new server and you created new replicas of the mail files over on that new server and you want mail to be delivered to that new server, you have to make sure the Person document has been updated in the Domino Directory to reflect that new server. \n\n\nQ18b. The Person document has been updated, but I'm noticing on the mail logs that mail is arriving on the original server and being re-directed to the new server. \nYou'll probably need to look at your mail routing rules. It's probably something in your mail routing configuration that would need to be fixed. Click here to open a Service Request (PMR) [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html]. \n\n\nQ19. I've got some issues with how do I set up the redirects so our iNotes users get directly to the new server, but the Traveler people still get to the old server. The Help that's there is not clear to me as to what I need to do to get Traveler traffic to go to one server and iNotes traffic to another \nIf you're using the same external IP address when they are coming in and it's being routed, on the server that's now the home mail server you would list the iNotes redirection database as the home URL for that server. So that when a request comes in to it, after the user authenticates they are sent to their mail file. But your firewall or proxy server would have to have rules set to send the request either to Traveler or to the mail server if you are using the same external address to connect to both servers. \n\n\nQ20. On 8.5.2, we have some users accessing their mail in a Web browser. Is this iNotes? \nYes. All mail templates come equipped to be accessed via the Web, which is called iNotes . You simply need the HTTP task running on your server. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nSSL & HTTP \n\nQ21. In 9.0.1, the way I understand it is, the HTTP server is now acting as a proxy in front of Domino for all the Web services. The question I have is load related to that proxy, because you're now really running a proxy server on the same machine as you're running your primary Domino server. Running Traveler, running iNotes from that machine. I haven't been able to find anything that really discusses what that does to the overall load on the machine and the differences then between running your 8.5 standard Domino install running iNotes and that. \nIn 9x, you can choose to install the optional IHS SSL proxy in front of your Domino server, but by no means is it a required option. It's there to allow Domino to be FIPS compliant and use greater than a SHAW-1 SSL certificate. That is provided so that you can do that higher level SSL security for the Domino server. If you choose not to go that way, then you could use any type SSL proxy server in front of Domino. It doesn't have to be installed on the same box as Domino. To allow you to do FIPS compliance out of the box starting in 9 we did add the IHS component that can be installed. \n\nAs far as any specific numbers impacted in that, I'm not aware of anything that we have out as to what the overall impact is. I'm not aware of any numbers. \n\n\nQ22. Were there any plans to upgrade the SSL component within Domino itself or is it going to remain a proxy option? The only reason I ask because the overhead of managing two machines instead of just one.  * There is an enhancement request out to do that but it is still in enhancement stage. If that does come to bear, it's not something that would be in the near future. Right now IBM is developing the two separate HTTP stacks, so right now to get Domino up since the IHS server already had that capability, the decision was made to just include that component. We're logging customer requests against that enhancement request to show the need and customer desire for that capability within the native Domino stack.\n\n * The only thing that I know of to consider when we're talking about load and load balancing IBM HTTP server on the same box as the Domino server is the number of threads. And the domino.com file allows you to customize the number of threads that you have running. The Domino server's HTTP thread count is going to be 3x the number of HTTP threads. That's something to watch out for, it to make sure your server has enough threads. There's plenty of debugging and logging you can turn on to tell you how many threads you need. It shouldn't be any different. It should be able to handle the load it's just a matter of how many threads we have available to handle the number of users and the amount of work that's going on. \n\n\n\nQ23. Did the speaker just say if we use IHS install option it increases 3x HTTP threads on Domino box? \nWhat i was saying is that the default number of IHS threads is already 3x the default number of Domino HTTP threads. To start, it should be OK to leave things as is, with these default, unless we get errors that we are running out of threads. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nSmart Upgrade & Policies \n\nQ24. Can we have a discussion of Smart Upgrade and SMU by the experts? \nYes, now scheduled for August 30th! Follow the link below for details. \n * \n * Open Mic Webcast: Notes & Domino Smart Upgrade - 20 August 2014\n\n\n\nQ25. Has anyone been able to upgrade Notes clients with Smart Upgrade (on Windows 7) when the users are not admins?  * You can build a Smart Upgrade Kit and package the installer with the Windows Admin credentials. SUSetRunAsWizard works very nice!\n\n * When users aren't admins, we recommend using our SUSetRunAsWizard, which ships with Notes. It runs the install with an Admin wrapper. If you're having issues using it, please open a PMR and we can help you out! The SUSetRunAsWizards only purpose is to run an install with elevated rights. NOTE: Since it was designed well before Windows 7, there are a few bugs you might encounter that we can help you out with if you open a PMR. \n\n * Make sure to use the latest version of the SUSetRunAsWizard. Check out this site: http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/installblog.nsf [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/installblog.nsf] \n   -> Using the Smart Upgrade Run-As Wizard [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKTMJ_9.0.1/admin/upgr_usingthesmartupgraderunaswizard_c.dita]\n\n\n\nQ26. We have users on 8.5.2 and we give them new computers with an 8.5.3 image (single user client installs). We'll take their notes.ini, names, bookmark, desktop, and user ID and plop it down in the same directory structure on the new PC. We're finding that many of the people don't have their mail templates updated to the 8.5.3 mail template, even though we have that option set in our Desktop Settings Policy document. What has to happen for that policy to kick in so that it will automatically upgrade the users to their new template? \nI would have to go back and study exactly what you could do with policies. You know you can go in with the Administrator client and you can see what template everybody is using on the server. I would see those who aren't running the most recent template and I would run the Convert task on the server and bring them up to date automatically. Then it would replicate down to any local replicas that they have. \n\nI'd have to look back and familiarize myself more with the policy setting that says 'use this particular template' and when that gets applied. I don't know if that's just after the first time the client gets upgraded or if that's something you could push down to the client (I didn't think you could do that.) \n\n\nQ27. In the Desktop Settings document, it asks you to put in the Release number that they're at and then the template that you want them to go to. Do you have to include Fix Packs or will a base release version pick up any other machines that have a Fix Pack included? \nYou want to put an asterisk (wildcard) in the policy to pick up any Fix Packs. Because what that picks up is the Fault Recovery Build line in the notes.ini file, and that does include Fix Packs. So what you can do either manually specify Fix Packs in the Desktop Settings document or you can do just something like Release 9.0.1* (or something like that). \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nOpenSocial \n\n * \n * Installing the OpenSocial component \n * \n * \n * Configuring Domino Open Social Component\n *  \n * \n * \n * OpenSocial Component Deployment cookbook\n\n\nQ28. We're interested in incorporating OpenSocial. It sounds to me like we would be running another server for OpenSocial. Is that correct? \nFor the pieces, the Shindig server and to serve up the social components, yes. You don't have to put it on every single server, you just have to have it on one or a couple servers that your client can access. \n\n\nQ29. Are there bandwidth concerns or anything like that with regard to having OpenSocial in the mix? We've got a lot of branch locations on our WAN. Currently we have everything centrally located in one data center that everything comes back to. \nYou would probably have to test it out. You could always, if you had to, put a Shindig server in each geographic location, if need be. But the WAN should be fast enough that you could centralize and just have people accessing it through there. \n\nI would say test it and see how it works and if it looks good you could do it that way. Otherwise, you have the option of each region having it's own Social Component Shindig server. \n\n\nQ30. We are running a two-node Domino cluster. If we decide to install the Domino Social component, do we have to install it on both nodes of the cluster? \nIt is recommended to have servers in the cluster run the same version of Domino since the cluster functionality will try to keep the databases in sync. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nGeneral Administration & How to \n\nQ31. Is there a recommended order to run the three maintenance commands? (ie. Fixup, then Updall, then Compact)?  * Typically Fixup first, followed by Updall, then Compact. You do not have to run file maintenance in that order but it helps. \n * I recommend running Compact, studying the logs to see if anything failed and then run Fixup on any failed ones. Then re-run Compact followed by Updall. Doing it this way saves some cycles on running Fixup on everything. \n * For a detailed description of maintenance, see technote 7006573 - Administrator's guide to Domino Server maintenance [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg27006573]\n\n\n\nQ32. In a clustered environment, is one of the cluster nodes still considered the Administrative server? \nYes, but there isn't a setting to reflect this designation. Normally, the Administration server of the Domino Directory will have this assignment; otherwise, the first server placed in the cluster is considered the Admin server for the cluster. \n\n\nQ33. When you talk about FTPing, do you recommend pushing or pulling those files? Should I pull them from the new server or push them from the old server?  * I don't think it matters; I've done both. BUT you want to make sure is that you have the Domino servers on both sides down when you're transferring any .nsf files (to avoid corruption). \n * Also, don't transfer over the FTIs. Those you'll want to recreate on the new server.\n\n\n\nQ34. How do we set the template to only be refreshed from the administrative server? \nDatabase properties. See the Admin Help topic: To change design properties [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKTWP_8.5.2/com.ibm.notes85.help.doc/app_change_design_props_t.html] \n\n\nQ35. Isn't Outlook supported for a limited subset of users in Domino 9. How would I define limited subset?  * It's a special program.\n\n * \"IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook\" (IMSMO) is a Limited Availability feature for Domino mail as of Notes/Domino 9.0.1. IMSMO is also known by its beta code name \"Hawthorn\". Please contact your sales rep who can help determine if this solution will fit your needs.

Indirect files rock! but now we have multi-threaded compact so not use them that often anymore \nDBMT supports IND files and so does multi-threaded Compact for that matter. \n\n\nQ37. Regarding Sametime and Sametime Advanced. What do I need to look for as far as when I do the upgrade as to what would still be working and wouldn't be working after moving from 852 to 901. \nWe don't have anybody on the call to cover that question. Would recommend opening a PMR w/ the ST team for assistance. Click here to open a Service Request (PMR) [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html]. \n\n\nQ38.

It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.\n\nIBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.\n\nHardware \n\nDataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].\n\nFor end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. \n\nFirmware \n\nBusinesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.\n\nEffective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:\n\n 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.\n    \n    \n 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.\n     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.\n     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.\n    \n    \n\nFirmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nFirmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nNote: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported.

      "WPWCMCF 8000CCF RELEASE NOTES\n\nABSTRACT\n This document contains a list of known issues for previous WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fixes. For current known issues for the latest WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix, please see the WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix Readme. \n\nCONTENT\n\nKnown issues for previous WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fixes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV8.0.0.0 Combined WP & WCM CF06 (PM88092): \n\n\n\nProblem: When migrating with projects from 7002 to 8000, the migration may fail with NullPointerException during the 'move-wcm-projects' sub-task. \nSolution: This issue has already been fixed in 8001, migrate to 8001CF06 or later instead which does not exhibit the same issue. \n\nProblem: Rollback to WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix 04 fails. \nSolution: Perform the following steps to repair the rollback function: \n\n 1. Delete the directory named PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/wp.im_rollback_cfg.xml if it exists. \n 2. (If rolling back from V8.0.0.1 CF04 only ), Copy and rename the following file:\n\n * If you are rolling back directly from V8.0.0.1 CF04 to V8.0.0.0 CF04, then copy and rename the file:\n   PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/cf/wp.im_8001cf04_cfg.xml\n   to: \n   PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/wp.im_rollback_cfg.xml \n * If you are rolling back from V8.0.0.1 CF04 to V8.0.0.1 and then to V8.0.0.0 CF04, or if you are just rolling back from V8.0.0.1 to V8.0.0.0 CF04, then copy and rename the file:\n   PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/cf/wp.im_8001_cfg.xml\n   to: \n   PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/wp.im_rollback_cfg.xml\n   \n   1. Add the following line to the wp_profile_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/ConfigEngine/properties/wkplc.properties file:\n   portalPreupdateVersion=8.0.0.0\n   2. Rerun the rollback.\n\n\n\nProblem: A rollback to WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 from WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix 04 may result an incomplete rollback. \nSolution: Issue the following commands  1. ConfigEngine.sh -uninstall -offeringList PortalServer -unregisterOnly \n 2. ConfigEngine.sh -install -offeringRoot <PortalServer_root> -installPath <PortalServer_root> -expandBinaries false \n 3. ConfigEngine.sh CONFIG-WP-8000-BASE -DWasPassword=<pwd> -DPortalAdminPwd=<pwd>\n\n\n\nProblem: NoSuchMethodError is thrown when using PortletModelController or CommonPortletModelController even though PM72307 (included in CF03) is applied. \nSolution: Apply APAR PM77176 (not included in CF03). \n\n\nProblem: The installation program GUI seems to hang during validation of the Application Server and Portal Server credentials. \nSolution:  1. Cancel the install and exit the Installation Manager. \n 2. Edit the Installation Manager configuration file, found at \n\n * Windows: C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\Installation Manager\\eclipse\\configuration\\config.ini \n * Linux/Unix: /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/configuration/config.ini\n   1. Add the following line to this file:\n   WP_UPDATE_SKIP_VALIDATION=true\n   2. Save the file and run the Portal installation again.\n\n\n\nProblem: After installing or rolling back the cumulative fix, you may observe error messages similar to the following in the Installation Manager log file: \nInstallation Manager cannot remove feature Portal Server Profile during the Update or Rollback. \nInstallation Manager cannot add feature Create a new Deployment Manager Profile augmented with WebSphere Portal during the Update or Rollback. \nSolution: These messages do not indicate a problem. In order to prevent a configuration error, you are prevented from changing your feature selections when performing an update. If you wish to add or drop a Portal Server or Deployment Manager profile, you must choose the Modify function of Installation Manager instead. \n\n\nProblem: Configuration errors during rollback may be undetected by IBM Installation Manager. \nSolution: After performing a rollback, check the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine/log/ConfigTrace.log file to be sure the rollback was successful. If the UNCONFIG-WP-PTF-CF task ended with a status of BUILD FAILED, you should correct the condition that caused the failure and run the task again in order to fully remove updated artifacts from your Portal profile. \n\n\nProblem: If an error is seen starting server \"WebSphere_Portal\" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. \nThe error would appear similar to the following as part of the \"action-start-portal-server-standard\" task : \"ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal\" \nSolution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for \"Node restart state\" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment. \n\n\nProblem: Error EJPAH2010E: Failed to create virtual portal can be received when using iSeries DB2 as a database backend and attempting to create a Virtual Portal. The issue is a transaction timeout that does not allow the operation to complete before the timeout value is reached. \nSolution: Increasing the transaction timeout from the default of 120 seconds to 600 seconds should alleviate the issue. \n- Launch the Integrated Solutions Console (for example, from IBM WebSphere Portal First Steps) \n- Log in with your Portal Administration ID. \n- Click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name (e.g. WebSphere Portal) > Container Settings -> Container Services > Transaction Service. \n- Increase the Total transaction lifetime timeout to 600. \nThe default value is 120 \n- Increase the Maximum transaction timeout to 600 seconds. \nThe default value is 0. \nApply->Save \nStop and restart your Portal Server. \n\n\nProblem: PAA install fails due to incorrect execution order of extension points. \nSolution Installer generates extension points to install different kinds of artifacts of a PAA. The generated extension points will be called from the deploy-paa task, but the order of calling these extension points may be incorrect for your PAA. When PAA contains both an XMLaccess script and other artifacts, the install-content-xmlaccess extension point may be called ahead of other extension points in deploy-paa. This may cause the deploy-paa command to fail. \nSolution: After running the ConfigEngine install-paa command, go to the generated XML task files (a sample path to the task file is: WebSphere\\wp_profile\\paa\\<assembly_name>\\components\\<component_name>\\config\\includes\\xx_cfg.xml). Then find the task call of install-content-xmlaccess extension point in the deploy-paa task, (a sample of that line is: <antcall target=\"action-install-content-xmlaccess-applySIFeaturePack-components/<component_name>\"/>), move that line to the end of the task calls in the deploy-paa task. Now run the ConfigEngine deploy-paa command. \n\n\nProblem: During CF upgrade process, a repeating error \"getIndexCreationBean EJPJO0085E: Failed to retrieve index creation bean for collection ...\" is logged for all existing collections. \nSolution: The exception can be ignored. It results because Search Admin Portlet is upgraded and collections are opened while the server is upgraded. \n\n\nProblem: After upgrade an exception might be noticed in the logs \"SiapiSearchAd E com.ibm.hrl.siapi.search.admin.portlets.SiapiSearchAdminPortlet doView ... java.lang.NullPointerException ... SiapiSearchAdminPortlet.doView\". \nSolution: If the problem persists, restart the Portal Server. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV8.0.0.0 Combined WP & WCM CF05 (PM84209): \n\n\nProblem: If Java 7 Update 21 or Java 6 Update 45 is being used, a security dialog may appear every time when either Ephox EditLive or the WCM FileTransferApplet is instantiated. For Editlive specifically, a deadlock issue may occur which in some instances will cause the editor to freeze. \nSolution: This issue will be fixed in CF06. \n\nProblem: When migrating with projects from 7002 to 8000, the migration may fail with NullPointerException during the 'move-wcm-projects' sub-task. \nSolution: This issue has already been fixed in 8001, migrate to 8001CF05 instead which does not exhibit the same issue. \n\nProblem: Rollback to WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix 04 fails. \nSolution: Perform the following steps to repair the rollback function:  1. Delete the directory named PortalServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/installer/wp.iim/wp.im_rollback_cfg.xml if it exists. \n 2.

Add the following line to the wp_profile_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp8]/ConfigEngine/properties/wkplc.properties file:\n    portalPreupdateVersion=8.0.0.0 \n 4. Rerun the rollback.\n\n\n\nProblem: A rollback to WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 from WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.0 Combined Cumulative Fix 04 may result an incomplete rollback. \nSolution: Issue the following commands  1.

If the UNCONFIG-WP-PTF-CF task ended with a status of BUILD FAILED, you should correct the condition that caused the failure and run the task again in order to fully remove updated artifacts from your Portal profile. \n\n\nProblem: If an error is seen starting server \"WebSphere_Portal\" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. \nThe error would appear similar to the following as part of the \"action-start-portal-server-standard\" task : \"ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal\" \nSolution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for \"Node restart state\" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment. \n\n\nProblem: Error EJPAH2010E: Failed to create virtual portal can be received when using iSeries DB2 as a database backend and attempting to create a Virtual Portal. The issue is a transaction timeout that does not allow the operation to complete before the timeout value is reached. \nSolution: Increasing the transaction timeout from the default of 120 seconds to 600 seconds should alleviate the issue. \n- Launch the Integrated Solutions Console (for example, from IBM WebSphere Portal First Steps) \n- Log in with your Portal Administration ID. \n- Click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name (e.g. WebSphere Portal) > Container Settings -> Container Services > Transaction Service. \n- Increase the Total transaction lifetime timeout to 600. \nThe default value is 120 \n- Increase the Maximum transaction timeout to 600 seconds. \nThe default value is 0. \nApply->Save \nStop and restart your Portal Server. \n\n\nProblem: PAA install fails due to incorrect execution order of extension points. \nSolution Installer generates extension points to install different kinds of artifacts of a PAA. The generated extension points will be called from the deploy-paa task, but the order of calling these extension points may be incorrect for your PAA. When PAA contains both an XMLaccess script and other artifacts, the install-content-xmlaccess extension point may be called ahead of other extension points in deploy-paa. This may cause the deploy-paa command to fail. \nSolution: After running the ConfigEngine install-paa command, go to the generated XML task files (a sample path to the task file is: WebSphere\\wp_profile\\paa\\<assembly_name>\\components\\<component_name>\\config\\includes\\xx_cfg.xml). Then find the task call of install-content-xmlaccess extension point in the deploy-paa task, (a sample of that line is: <antcall target=\"action-install-content-xmlaccess-applySIFeaturePack-components/<component_name>\"/>), move that line to the end of the task calls in the deploy-paa task. Now run the ConfigEngine deploy-paa command. \n\n\nProblem: During CF upgrade process, a repeating error \"getIndexCreationBean EJPJO0085E: Failed to retrieve index creation bean for collection ...\" is logged for all existing collections. \nSolution: The exception can be ignored. It results because Search Admin Portlet is upgraded and collections are opened while the server is upgraded. \n\n\nProblem: After upgrade an exception might be noticed in the logs \"SiapiSearchAd E com.ibm.hrl.siapi.search.admin.portlets.SiapiSearchAdminPortlet doView ... java.lang.NullPointerException ... SiapiSearchAdminPortlet.doView\". \nSolution: If the problem persists, restart the Portal Server. \n\n\n\nProblem: An error similar to the following may occur during migration. The problem is caused while the migration is attempted to remove extraneous data from the system.

Similar to other upgrade\nsoftware, the fix pack image also can be locally installed on a computer where \nthe product software is not already installed.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix\n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled \n'Upgrade prerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory.The default valuefor CANDLEHOME is \n'/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm' on Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Monitoring Agent for MySQL Agent's se.ini file \non UNIX system,this file should be backed up before the fix install. \nAfter this fix is installed,edit the latest se.ini file and merge your \nmodifications into this se.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNNR4ML.tar.gz or .iso) \nto a temporary directory on the system that contains the agent \ncode to be updated.For the purpose of this README,the symbol \n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems \nor an unzip utility on Windows systems.This creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's \nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNNR4ML.tar.gz or .iso) to a \ntemporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. \nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully \nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems.\n\n3. To add the fix pack bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the tacmd addBundles command, see Appendix A. Commands reference\nof the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNNR4ML:\n\n>$ CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles \n-i <TEMP>/CNNR4ML/unix -t se -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles \nto be added to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case or \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for MySQL Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNNR4ML:\n>%CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i\n<TEMP>\\CNNR4ML\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t se -f\n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case se \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for MySQL Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information on the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see Appendix A. Commands\nreference of the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t se \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 072101000\n\nOn a Windows system:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t SE \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 072101000\n\nIf there are not prior version kse agent on remote system .Then use \nbelow tacmd addSystem command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addSystem -t SE \n-n <Managed system name> \n-p INSTANCE=\"<MySQL instance name>\"\n\nNote:\n- The <MySQL instance name> is the MySQL agent instance name to be\nmonitored on remote system.\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (se), not three characters (kse).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n- Remote installation will fail if the MTEMS window is open on \nthe agent machine.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop:\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNNR4ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \nthe IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote\n(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to login \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server prior to viewing the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t se\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t SE \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version will be \n07.21.01.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (SE), not three characters (KSE).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, \nuse the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command\non Linux or UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each \nof the following systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, then components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo\n\nThis command offers you four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows. Choose the option that meets your needs.\n\n*********** Tue Nov 14 16:44:01 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: mysqluser Groups: mysqlGroup\nHost name : pts00606-vm16 Installer Lvl:06.30.07.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Tue Nov 14 16:44:47 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: mysqluser Groups: mysqlGroup\nHost name : pts00606-vm16 Installer Lvl:06.30.07.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nlpl266 Version: 06.30.07.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nlpl266 Version: 08.00.50.69\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nlpl266 Version: 07.09.50.00\n\nse IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for MYSQL\nlpl266 Version: 07.21.01.00\n\nue Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nlpl266 Version: 06.30.07.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nlpl266 Version: 06.30.07.00\n\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run \nthe following command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\n>kincinfo -i\n\nkincinfo output:\n\nWindows: Monitoring Agent for MYSQL:\n\nSE KSE(64-bit) CMA/Monitoring Agent for MySQL\nWIX64 Version: 07.21.01.00 Build: 73311\n\nUE KUE(32-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.05.00 Build: d5163a\n\nUI KUI(32-bit) CLI/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nWINNT Version: 06.30.05.00 Build: 201506122221\n\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\n\nProblem : Following workspaces do not show data - Statistics, Availability,\nAgent Configuration,Global variables, when agent is configured to \nmonitor MySQL server version 5.7.6 and above.

      "MySQL ITCAM UA CAMADALL CAMADINST monitor database TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):\n US English \n\nQUESTION\n jdbc calls are observed in the ITCAM for AD/WAS product. Does this mean that ITCAM can be used to monitor \"MySQL\" also? \n\nANSWER\nITCAM for WAS / Application Diagnostics was designed to monitor J2EE based WAS and non-WAS servers. Whenever Level 2 or Level 3 monitoring is enabled, you will be able to see the JDBC call response times in live component traces and reports. If you have ITCAM for Transactions enabled/configured, you will see jdbc methods/calls there too. Thus, it is possible to track the response time of every SQL call to a MySQL database. \n\nThis does not mean you can monitor the MySQL database, as ITCAM for WAS/AD is not designed to do that. If you do want to monitor the MySQL database you must use the ITM Universal Agent to do that or if you want to monitor other Databases like DB2, Oracle, you can use another ITM agent for that. \n\nThe ITCAM for WAS/AD application only sees JDBC calls and you can get an idea of how long these method calls took in the application. For other detailed monitoring aspects of the MySQL or DB2 or Oracle database, use UA or another specific agent for that database itself.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Application Diagnostics AIX, AIX 64bit, AIX 6.1, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 7.1 \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n ITCAM for WAS ITCAM ITCAMAD ITCAM4AD",

There is nowhere that Guardium can pick up the exact Source Program from.\n\nANSWER\nBecause of the above reason, based on the behavior of protocol, the best Guardium is able to determine is \"MySQL CLIENT\" or \"MySQL ODBC CLIENT\" as 'SOURCE PROGRAM'.

For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. \n\n \n\nNote: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.\n\n\nCAUSE\nFew tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.\n\n\nMore details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nMySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUsers wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. \n\nThis variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: \n\nset global show_compatibility_56=ON; \n\n \n\nThe default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is \u2018ON\u2019 and for versions >=5.7.8 is \u2018OFF\u2019. \n\n \n\nUser can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: \n\nshow global variables like \"show_compatibility_56\"; \n\n \n\nThis variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. \n\nUser needs to add the following line to the \u2018my.cnf\u2019 file (located at \u2018<MySQL_Installation_Dir>/my.cnf\u2019 for Windows and \u2018/etc/my.cnf\u2019 for UNIX/Linux): \n\nshow_compatibility_56=ON \n\n \n\nThe paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file. For more details on where your installation of MySQL server looks for the 'my.cnf' file, refer the URL: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html] \n\n \n\nNote: Change in 'my.cnf' file will require a MySQL server re-start for the changes to take effect. \n\n \n\nMore details on the system variable 'show_compatibility_56' here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56 [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56]\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n Monitoring agent for MySQL Sever"

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n You have added a channel authentication record into a WebSphere MQ 7.1 or later queue manager:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL) ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nThen you display it:\n\nDISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\n1 : DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\nCLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\nNow you want to remove it and you try executing the following runmqsc command which you constructed using copy and paste from the above output:\n\nDELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n3 : DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\nYou get the following error:\n\nAMQ8405: Syntax error detected at or near end of command segment below:-\nDELETE CHLAUTH\n\nThe DELETE CHLAUTH does not exist and after consulting the MQ 7.1 Information Center you read that you have to use the SET CHLAUTH command with the argument ACTION(REMOVE). You try now:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n19 : SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n\nBut you get the following error:\n\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou specified the attribute CLNTUSER(testuser) as it was shown in the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*), thus, you think the record should be found. You want to know what is the problem?\n\n\nCAUSE\nSee the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:\nWebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands\nWebSphere MQ object names [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/fa11060_.htm]\n+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands\nMQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries"

You get an error with reason code 2035:\n\n2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED\n\nRelated error codes:\nMQ Explorer => AMQ4036 \nMQ classes for JMS => JMSWMQ2013\n\nThe MQ Administrator can remotely access (via a server-connection channel) without problems other MQ queue managers at version 6 or 7.0.x. \n\nCAUSE\nYou created a new queue manager in MQ 7.1 or later. The default value for the new feature introduced in 7.1, \"Channel Authentication Records\" (CHLAUTH) is ENABLED. You can see the value by using runmqsc:\n$ runmqsc QmgrName\nDISPLAY QMGR CHLAUTH\nAMQ8408: Display Queue Manager details.\nQMNAME(TEST01) CHLAUTH(ENABLED)\n\nBy default, the following 3 channel authentication records are generated when a new queue manager is created in 7.1 or upgraded to 7.1:\n\nDISPLAY CHLAUTH(*)\n1 : DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP)\nADDRESS(*) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(SYSTEM.*) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP)\nADDRESS(*) USERSRC(NOACCESS)\n\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(*) TYPE(BLOCKUSER)\nUSERLIST(*MQADMIN)\n\nThe last record blocks all server-connection channel access to any MQ Administrator. The effect is that non-administrative users can still connect if suitably authorized to do so, but administrative connections and anonymous connections are disallowed regardless of any Object Authority Manager (OAM) authorization settings. This means that new queue managers in V7.1 are much more secure by default than in previous versions, but with the trade off that administrative access must be explicitly defined.\n\n+++ Additional notes:\n\na) If you upgraded a queue manager to MQ 7.1 this new feature is NOT enabled by default.\n\n$ runmqsc QmgrName\nDISPLAY QMGR CHLAUTH\nAMQ8408: Display Queue Manager details.\nQMNAME(TEST01) CHLAUTH(DISABLED)\n\nHowever, this new feature can be enabled by issuing the following command in runmqsc:\nALTER QMGR CHLAUTH(ENABLED)\n\nb) You use the MQ Explorer to remotely access (via a server-connection channel) the newly created 7.1 queue manager and get the following errors:\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137&amp;aid=1]\n\nText inside the dialog box:\nAccess not permitted. You are not authorized to perform this operation. (AMQ4036)\nSeverity: 10 (Warning)\nExplanation: The queue manager security mechanism has indicated that the userid associated with this request is not authorized to access the object.\n\nAfter closing the above dialog, the next one appears:\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137&amp;aid=2]\n\nText inside the dialog box:\nAn error occurred connecting to queue manager 'QM_71 on 'host.x.com(14xx)''. Are you sure that you want to show this queue manager in the folder anyway? (AMQ4027)\nSeverity: 10 (Warning)\nExplanation: A connection could not be made to the specified remote queue manager.\nResponse: Ensure that the named queue manager is running on the host and port specified, and has a channel corresponding to the specified name. Ensure that you have the authority to connect to the remote queue manager, and ensure that the network is running. Select Yes if you believe that the problem can be resolved later. Select No if you want to correct the problem now and try again.\n\n\nc) In the error log for the queue manager you see either the error AMQ9776 or AMQ9777, followed by AMQ9999\n\nc.1) AMQ9776: Channel was blocked by userid\nEXPLANATION: The inbound channel 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN' was blocked from address\n'9.49.x.x' because the active values of the channel were mapped to a userid which should be blocked. The active values of the channel were 'MCAUSER(rivera) CLNTUSER(rivera)'.\nACTION: Contact the systems administrator, who should examine the channel authentication records to ensure that the correct settings have been configured. The ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH switch is used to control whether channel authentication records are used. The command DISPLAY CHLAUTH can be used to query the channel authentication records.\n\nc.2) AMQ9777: Channel was blocked\nEXPLANATION:The inbound channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' was blocked from address '127.0.0.1'\nbecause the active values of the channel matched a record configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active values of the channel were 'CLNTUSER()'.\nACTION: Contact the systems administrator, who should examine the channel authentication records to ensure that the correct settings have been configured. The ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH switch is used to control whether channel authentication records are used. The command DISPLAY CHLAUTH can be used to query the channel authentication records. \n\nc.3) Either of the above errors is followed by:\n\nAMQ9999: Channel 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN' to host 'x (9.49.x.x)' ended abnormally.\n\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n1) If this is a production queue manager, then you could stop trying to use a userid that is an MQ Administrator and instead, use a non-administrator userid to access the queue manager. \n\n\n2) If you really want the MQ Administrator to be able to access the queue manager via client channels, you could do one of the following actions:\n\n2.a) You can add the following two Channel Authentication Records:\n\nThe first rule blocks administrative users and the MCAUSER \"nobody\" (which prevents someone from creating a user ID \"nobody\" and putting it into an authorized group).\n$ runmqsc QmgrName\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody','*MQADMIN')\n\nThe second rule provides a reduced blacklist for SYSTEM.ADMIN channels that allows administrators to use these. It is assumed here that some other CHLAUTH rule such as an SSLPEERMAP has validated the administrator\u2019s connection or that an exit has done so.\nSET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.*) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody')\n\nThe above rules apply to SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN which is used by the MQ Explorer. \n\nIf you are using another user-defined channel, such as MY.ADMIN.SVRCONN, then you need to add the following two records:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS(*) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody')\n\nNote: it is not advisable to use SYSTEM.DEF.* channels for active connections. The system default channels are the objects from which all user-defined channels inherit properties. The recommended practice is that SYSTEM.DEF.* and SYSTEM.AUTO.* channels should NOT be configured to be usable.\n\n2.b) This is a variation of (2.a) but allowing the MQ Administrator to only use a particular host.\n\nThe first rule blocks MCAUSER \"nobody\".\nSET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody')\n\nThe second rule removes all access to SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN ...\nSET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS(*) ACTION(REMOVE)\n\n... and the third rule adds an entry for the server that needs access.\nSET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS(9.27.4x.7y) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\n\n2.c) Disable the Channel Authentication Records feature:\n\nALTER QMGR CHLAUTH(DISABLED)\n\nWARNING: Disabling this new feature is not recommended for MQ 7.1 production queue managers due to security implications.\nNote that disabling CHLAUTH results in a policy that accepts administrative connections by default. The administrative effort to lock down administrative access with CHLAUTH(DISABLED) is much greater than to do so with CHLAUTH(ENABLED). It is therefore recommended to leave CHLAUTH(ENABLED) and use the other security features of WebSphere MQ V7.1 to authenticate administrator connections.\n\n\n+++ Related technotes\n\nMQ 7.1: How to remove a CHLAUTH record [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577138]\n\nRemote connection to v7.1 queue manager on IBMi fails with AMQ4036, Access not permitted [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21597265]\n\n+++ Advanced details in the trace\n\nAn example of the trace for the MQ queue manager for this error condition is shown below:\n\nTrace for process: amqrmppa\n\n000012 0x1018D30C 2A 4E 4F 41 43 43 45 53 53 : *NOACCESS\n000051E8 08:57:27.404186 6640.14 RSESS:000012 (11)------------{ rriCheckUserBlocked\n000051E9 08:57:27.404199 6640.14 RSESS:000012 (12)-------------{ rrxError\n000051EA 08:57:27.404215 6640.14 RSESS:000012 RetCode = 20009777, rc1 = 0, rc2 = 0, Comment1 = 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN', Comment2 = '127.0.0.1', Comment3= 'CLNTUSER()', File= 'F:\\build\\p000_P\\src\\base\\src\\cmqxrmsa.c', Line= '885'\n000051EB 08:57:27.404236 6640.14 RSESS:000012 (12)-------------}! rrxError (rc=rrcE_CHLAUTH_BLOCKED_NOACCESS)\n000051EC 08:57:27.404505 6640.14 RSESS:\n\nThe error rrcE_CHLAUTH_BLOCKED_NOACCESS is mapped to 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED as seen in the following reformatted trace:\n\n00005508 08:57:27.417747 6640.14 RSESS:000012 Channel Name:SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN\n00005509 08:57:27.417766 6640.14 RSESS:000012 Sending Data:- [Data:-]\n00005509 08:57:27.417766 6640.14 RSESS:000012 0x00C8E020 54 53 48 4D 00 00 01 80 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 : TSHM...\u20ac..... ----------------------+ Transmission Segment Header (TSHM)\n00005509 08:57:27.417766 6640.14 RSESS:000012 0x00C8E030 02 91 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 11 01 00 00 : .\u20180............. | StrucId {+000} | 'TSHM'\n00005509 08:57:27.417766 6640.14 RSESS:000012 0x00C8E040 B5 01 00 00 00 00 01 78 02 00 00 00 F3 07 00 00 : .......x........ | Length {+004} | 384\n00005509 08:57:27.417766 6640.14 RSESS:000012 0x00C8E050 00 00 00 00 51 4D 5F 56 37 31 30 20 20 20 20 20 : ....QM_V710 | Conv.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When viewing a PDF document in OnDemand, I receive the following error: \n\n\"dispatch -acroexch.app could not be loaded\" \n\nCAUSE\nIf the application's Data Type is defined as PDF, the OnDemand client requires Adobe\u00ae Acrobat to be installed in order to view the PDF document. \nThe OnDemand client requires an Adobe Acrobat viewer that contains an OLE interface to view the PDF, which is only provided in Adobe Acrobat (Adobe Reader does not provide this OLE interface).\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you get the error: unable to load adobeacrobatexch when you view a PDF document from the OnDemand client, take the following steps: \n\n 1. Ensure that you have Adobe Acrobat installed and associated with the .pdf extension in Windows\u00ae. \n 2. In the C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\OnDemand32\\PDF directory, copy the ARSPDF32.API file to your adobe/acrobat/plugins directory. \n 3. Restart your OnDemand client and attempt to view the PDF document again.\n\n\nNote: The OnDemand client will attempt to automatically perform step 2 during installation if Adobe Acrobat is previously installed.  \n\nAlternatively, if the Data Type under the application is user-defined .pdf, the OnDemand client will instead launch the application associated with this extension in Windows to handle the viewing of this document. In this situation, Adobe Reader can be used to view the PDF, as this will bypass viewing the document within the OnDemand client and through the OLE interface.",

While the \"Auto Recover\" field may appear to be valid inside of Microsoft Word settings, it is possible that the group policy settings for Microsoft Word has this setting enabled, but with no value entered. By default, if this setting is enabled, the value of the path is actually blank and needs to be filled out. \n\n\nTo access the group policy settings for Microsoft Word, it may be necessary to install the Office Group Policy ADM files available at the following location:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=92759d4b-7112-4b6c-ad4a-bbf3802a5c9b&displaylang=en [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=92759d4b-7112-4b6c-ad4a-bbf3802a5c9b&displaylang=en] (For MS Word 2000 - 2003 SP1)\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=92D8519A-E143-4AEE-8F7A-E4BBAEBA13E7&displaylang=en [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=92D8519A-E143-4AEE-8F7A-E4BBAEBA13E7&displaylang=en] (For Word 2007)\n\nTo resolve this, launch the Group Policy Editor (Start > Run > gpedit.msc), and navigate to the following setting:\n\nIf you do not see this setting, but have installed the ADM file, you must add the ADM file. Right click on the \"Microsoft Office Word 2007\" folder shown below, and select \"Add/Remove Templates\", and browse to the ADM file that you installed.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21295607&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21295607&aid=2]\n\nRight click \"AutoRecover files\" and either enter a path in the \"AutoRecover files\" field below, or set this value to \"Not Configured\". Notice that by default, this field is blank which is causing the error. A valid path needs to be set in this field to prevent this issue from occurring again.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21295607&amp;aid=3]\n\nPlease note:\n\nThis is strictly a Microsoft Word issue.

      " DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n This Fix Pack will upgrade your SPSS Statistics 24.0 installation to SPSS Statistics 24.0 FP2 (24.0.0.2) \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\nThis Fix Pack provides important product corrections for SPSS Statistics 24.0.\n\n\nIssues Corrected and Release Note(s): Fix List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049686]\n\nNOTE: The 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack contains all Interim Fixes made available for 24.0.0.0, as well as other corrected issues, and can be installed over any of the earlier Interim Fixes with no conflict.\n\nPREREQUISITES\nThis Fix Pack is language independent but can only be installed over existing client and server installations of IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.0\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n \nInstallation Windows \n\n 1. Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 3. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 4. Run the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack executable.\n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is now the installed version.\n\n\nGuidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Windows-based clients: NOTE: This Fix Pack may require the machine to be rebooted to complete the installation. Please be aware that \"pushing\" the installation in unattended, silent mode may therefore force an unexpected machine reboot on a user, and schedule such installations accordingly. \n\nThe SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Windows Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Extracting the Contents of a Downloaded Installer file\" and \"Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers\". \n\nIn this case: \n\n 1. Download the appropriate installer file to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Open a command window as the local Administrator account and change directory to the temporary download location. \n 3. Extract the \"SPSSStatistics24.0.0.2Patch.msi\" and locale-specific .mst file into a specified location from the downloaded FixPack installer file, \"24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe\",using the documented \"/b\" switch: 24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe /b\"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\" (where <OS> is your operating system) \n 4. You can then copy the two extracted files to a network share for easier distribution. \n 5. Install the patch: \n    \n    msiexec /i \"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\\SPSS_Statistics_24002_<OS>_Patch.msi\" /qn /L*V \"%temp%\\SPSSStatistics24002PatchLog.txt\" PYTHON_EXISTS=\"1\" TRANSFORMS=\"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\\1033.mst\"\n    \n    (where <OS> is the same operating system specification as in step 3)\n\n\nInstallation Mac \n\n 1. Download and save the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack to your local hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Execute the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack installer from the downloaded .dmg file. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the About Statistics 24 menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 release is supported on Apple Macintosh OS X 10.10.x (Yosemite) through macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) \n\nGuidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Macintosh-based clients: \n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 for Mac OS X has a silent (push) installer. To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: \n\n 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). \n 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. \n 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:\n    USER_INSTALL_DIR=/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24 \n 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. \n 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:\n    \n    ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties\n\n\nInstallation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the \u2018root\u2019 user. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run.

Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. \n 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. \n 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. \n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.\n\n\nInstallation UNIX/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX / Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation \n\n 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. \n 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. \n 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the /bin, /lib and /common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: \n    \n    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator\u2019s Guide for more information. \n 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): ./<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. \n 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): ./<installer_name>\n    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. \n 7. Start the Statistics Server after the Fix Pack installation is complete. \n 8. Run ./statisticsb and enter SHOW VERSION. The response should indicate 24.00.00.02\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n What is the StaleConnectionException, why is it issued by WebSphere Application Server, and what should be done about it? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn WebSphere Application Server, the StaleConnectionException is issued when the database vendor issues an exception indicating that a connection currently in the connection pool is no longer valid. This can happen for many reasons, including: \n\n * The application tries to get a connection and fails, as when the database is not started.\n   \n   \n * A connection is no longer usable due to a database failure. When an application tries to use a connection it has previously obtained, the connection is no longer valid. In this case, all connections currently in use by an application can get this error when they try to use the connection.\n   \n   \n * The application using the connection has already called close() and then tries to use the connection again.\n   \n   \n * The application tries to use a JDBC\u2122 resource, such as a statement, obtained on a now-stale connection.\n\n\nWhen the StaleConnectionException is issued, the behavior is determined by the Purge Policy setting for the connection pool. If the Purge Policy is set to EntirePool, the entire pool is flushed. But if the Purge Policy is set to FailingConnectionOnly, only the connection that caused the StaleConnectionException is purged from the pool. \n\nAn application can recover from bad connections by explicitly catching the StaleConnectionException and getting a new connection from the pool. Numerous exceptions issued by DB2, Oracle, DataDirect (for connecting to SQLServer), Sybase, and Informix are currently mapped to the StaleConnectionException, which makes recovery easier for the application programmer. The following pseudocode provides an example of how to recover from a StaleConnectionException: \n\n//get a userTransaction\njavax.transaction.UserTransaction tran = getSessionContext().getUserTransaction();\n//retry indicates whether to retry or not\n//numOfRetries states how many retries have\n// been attempted\nboolean retry = false;\nint numOfRetries = 0;\njava.sql.Connection conn = null;\njava.sql.Statement stmt = null;\ndo {\ntry {\n//begin a transaction\ntran.begin();\n//Assumes that a datasource has already been obtained\n//from JNDI\nconn = ds.getConnection();\nconn.setAutoCommit(false);\nstmt = conn.createStatement();\nstmt.execute(\"INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES VALUES\n(0101, 'Bill', 'R', 'Smith')\");\ntran.commit();\nretry = false;\n} catch(java.sql.SQLException sqlX)\n{\n// If the error indicates the connection is stale, then\n// rollback and retry the action\nif (com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.WSCallHelper\n.getDataStoreHelper(ds)\n.isConnectionError(sqlX))\n{\ntry {\ntran.rollback();\n} catch (java.lang.Exception e) {\n//deal with exception\n//in most cases, this can be ignored\n}\nif (numOfRetries < 2) {\nretry = true;\nnumOfRetries++;\n} else {\nretry = false;\n}\n}\nelse\n{\n//deal with other database exception\nretry = false\n}\n} finally {\n//always cleanup JDBC resources\ntry {\nif(stmt != null) stmt.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\ntry {\nif(conn != null) conn.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\n}\n} while (retry) ;  \n\nFurther details about WebSphere Connection Pooling are located in the WebSphere Application Server Knowledge Center article Connection pooling [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_conpool.html]\n\nKnowledge Center article Exceptions pertaining to data access [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_daexcp.html] contains details on the StaleConnectionException error\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n What is the StaleConnectionException, why is it issued by WebSphere Application Server, and what should be done about it? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn WebSphere Application Server, the StaleConnectionException is issued when the database vendor issues an exception indicating that a connection currently in the connection pool is no longer valid. This can happen for many reasons, including: \n\n * The application tries to get a connection and fails, as when the database is not started.\n   \n   \n * A connection is no longer usable due to a database failure. When an application tries to use a connection it has previously obtained, the connection is no longer valid. In this case, all connections currently in use by an application can get this error when they try to use the connection.\n   \n   \n * The application using the connection has already called close() and then tries to use the connection again.\n   \n   \n * The application tries to use a JDBC\u2122 resource, such as a statement, obtained on a now-stale connection.\n\n\nWhen the StaleConnectionException is issued, the behavior is determined by the Purge Policy setting for the connection pool. If the Purge Policy is set to EntirePool, the entire pool is flushed. But if the Purge Policy is set to FailingConnectionOnly, only the connection that caused the StaleConnectionException is purged from the pool. \n\nAn application can recover from bad connections by explicitly catching the StaleConnectionException and getting a new connection from the pool. Numerous exceptions issued by DB2, Oracle, DataDirect (for connecting to SQLServer), Sybase, and Informix are currently mapped to the StaleConnectionException, which makes recovery easier for the application programmer. The following pseudocode provides an example of how to recover from a StaleConnectionException: \n\n//get a userTransaction\njavax.transaction.UserTransaction tran = getSessionContext().getUserTransaction();\n//retry indicates whether to retry or not\n//numOfRetries states how many retries have\n// been attempted\nboolean retry = false;\nint numOfRetries = 0;\njava.sql.Connection conn = null;\njava.sql.Statement stmt = null;\ndo {\ntry {\n//begin a transaction\ntran.begin();\n//Assumes that a datasource has already been obtained\n//from JNDI\nconn = ds.getConnection();\nconn.setAutoCommit(false);\nstmt = conn.createStatement();\nstmt.execute(\"INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES VALUES\n(0101, 'Bill', 'R', 'Smith')\");\ntran.commit();\nretry = false;\n} catch(java.sql.SQLException sqlX)\n{\n// If the error indicates the connection is stale, then\n// rollback and retry the action\nif (com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.WSCallHelper\n.getDataStoreHelper(ds)\n.isConnectionError(sqlX))\n{\ntry {\ntran.rollback();\n} catch (java.lang.Exception e) {\n//deal with exception\n//in most cases, this can be ignored\n}\nif (numOfRetries < 2) {\nretry = true;\nnumOfRetries++;\n} else {\nretry = false;\n}\n}\nelse\n{\n//deal with other database exception\nretry = false\n}\n} finally {\n//always cleanup JDBC resources\ntry {\nif(stmt != null) stmt.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\ntry {\nif(conn != null) conn.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\n}\n} while (retry) ;  \n\nFurther details about WebSphere Connection Pooling are located in the WebSphere Application Server Knowledge Center article Connection pooling [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_conpool.html]\n\nKnowledge Center article Exceptions pertaining to data access [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_daexcp.html] contains details on the StaleConnectionException error\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"

      "external; AddToMakefile; build; make; File element; MakeFile; external object; external objects; make file TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can you configure the default setting of IBM Rational Rhapsody Developer Edition for C++ (RiC++) in order to include external source files into MakeFile? \n\nCAUSE\nIn some cases, you want to import legacy source files into Rhapsody models as external elements. For those externally imported elements (classes and files), Rhapsody doesn't generate code, hence you can preserve legacy code as part of your existing model. However, by default, Rhapsody excludes those external elements from the build even though you turn CG::File::AddToMakefile [File::AddToMakefile] property on.\n\nANSWER\nFor general information regarding code generation for external elements, see \"Code generation for external elements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc%2Ftopics%2Frhp_r_dm_cd_genrtion_extnl_elmts.html]\" topic in Rhapsody Info Center. This technote will provide 3 solutions to allow the inclusion of external elements into the build. \n\n\nSolution 1 - Use Component File element \n\n * \n * \n * Add source file to the build\n * \n\n\nSolution 2 - Use File/Class element \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Note:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Add a Class/File element to map the external source code into the model. Set property CG::Class::UseAsExternal as \"checked\" for the added element. Set property CG::File::AddToMakefile [File::AddToMakefile] as \"checked\". Set the path to the external file in property CG::Class:FileName to make Rhapsody aware the location of the external source code. The path info would be used in MakeFile generated by Rhapsody.\n   \n   Note: Both absolute and relative path are supported. Right click the model element, from context menu, click Add New > SourceArtifact.\n   \n   Note: In order to include this external model element into MakeFile, SourceArtifact is required for the external model element. To enable the display of SourceArtifact, make sure Top Menu > View > Browser Display Options > Show Source Artifacts is checked.\n   Make sure the type of added SourceArtifact is set either \"Logical\" or \"Implementation\" (DO NOT choose \"Specification\"). \n   Rename SourceArtifact with the name of the external source code (e.g. rename the element to \"hoo\", if the external file name is \"hoo.cpp\"). Click [Elements] tab of the SourceArtifact to make sure the model element is correctly mapped in SourceArtifact. In case of Class, the mapping will be done automatically. For File, manually add its parent element to [Elements] tab as below:\n   \n   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621937&amp;aid=1]\n   \n   IMPORTANT: You might occasionally find the behavior of File is not consistent with Class. This is because File element is designed to be used as external element only, and not supposed to be built from Rhapsody. You are encouraged to use external Class element in RiC++ model to avoid any confusion you might experience. Generate MakeFile to make sure the external source file (e.g. hoo.obj) file is being added in the build.\n   \n\nSolution 3 - Use Additional Sources setting \n\n * \n * \n * [Additional Sources]\n * \n * [Settings]\n * \n *  \n   \n   Note: \n * \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Code generation for external elements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc%2Ftopics%2Frhp_r_dm_cd_genrtion_extnl_elmts.html]\nAdd source file to the biuld [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/topic/com.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc/topics/rhp_t_dm_adding_source_files_build.html?resultof=%22%61%64%64%22%20%22%73%6f%75%72%63%65%22%20%22%73%6f%75%72%63%22%20%22%66%69%6c%65%22%20%22%62%75%69%6c%64%22%20]"

At irregular intervals Rhapsody clears the\n   Rhapsody.ini file. I.e file becomes empty. This is very rare but\n   has happend to most of their developers at least once. Not sure\n   of the sequence of events that causes this though.\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   2] More Insights from the Customer:\n   \n   \n   a) How do you open Rhapsody 7.5.1 after ini becomes empty?\n   ??Customer?? Rhapsody creates a default .ini file but what we do\n   is that we copy\n   from someone else. Some have also made backups of their .ini\n   file.\n   \n   b) Does it occur randomly or is it seen suddenly when working on\n   a\n   particular project?\n   \n   ??Customer?? It seem very random (and rare).\n   \n   c) When you mention ini file is empty, does its size becomes 0\n   bytes or\n   is it corrupted in parts?\n   ??Customer?? The .ini file is empty (0 bytes)\n   \n   \n   d) When was this issue last seen?\n   ??Customer?? Last seen day before yesterday.\n   \n   e) Is it seen after closing Rhapsody that ini file is empty?\n   \n   ??Customer?? In most cases it is not discovered until the next\n   start of Rhapsody.\n   Unfortunately there is not much I can add to this. Most times it\n   is\n   discovered the following day when Rhapsody is started. The last\n   \n   occurrence gave a bit more info in that it was discovered when\n   the user tried to\n   build the code. The user had just done a save (could this be\n   when it\n   happened?)\n   \n   \n   f) Is a CM tool involved?\n   If so, is the INI file also in CM.  In that case which CM Tool\n   is used along with its version details will help.\n   ??Customer?? Yes we use a CM tool (ClearCase). However the .ini\n   file is not under version control.\n   \n   \n   g) Is there a Platform or Workflow integration?\n   If so Is it with eclipse or VS and how is the behavior working\n   directly on Rhapsody\n   ??Customer?? There is no platform/workflow integration.\n   \n   \n   h) Is the customer working with scripts (Java API or anything\n   else)?\n   If so, is there any script/api which uses (read/write)\n   rhapsody.ini\n   ??Customer?? Yes we use Java scripts. None of them modify the\n   .ini file\n   \n   \n   i) What is the location of Rhapsody installation. Is it local\n   for each developer or somewhere on the network?\n   ??Customer?? The location is the default location. I.e.\n   'C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\Rational\\Rhapsody\\7.5.1\n   \n   \n   j) Where the ini file is located? Is it right at the\n   installation folder, or user profile, or some other place?\n   ??Customer?? The ini file is in the installation folder\n   (default).\n   \n   \n   k) Were there rhapsody.ini files created at some unexpected\n   locations?\n   ??Customer?? honestly have no idea on the last question. I will\n   ask around but if it was it might have ended up in a place where\n   it has later on been removed. Will ask that the next time it\n   happens the disks are searched.\n   \n   \n   3] Support Observations:\n   * Searched the existing records for similar scenarios.

The preferred method would be remote install, but I'm not even able to perform tamcd addbundles as it complains about missing prerequisites.\n\nIf I try to install the agent locally on the Linux machine, the list of available agents does not include NMA agent at all.\n\nIs there a solution to this problem?",

      "ITM Virtual environments install NMA N4 unable find bundle prerequisites CI addbundles TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The installation of NMA agent from package ITM for Virtual Environment V7.2.0.3 is failing with both remote or local installation on Linux x86-64. \n\nSYMPTOM\n1) The import of the whole bundle using command: \n\n/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix\n\nwill fail with message:\n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\n--\n\n2) Even if you succeed in importing the bundle, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).\n\n--\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2.\nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. \n\nAnyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. \n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. \n\n--------------- \n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>22</Release>\n\n<Mod>04</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>30</Release>\n\n<Mod>05</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as

      "ITM Virtual environments install NMA N4 unable find bundle prerequisites CI addbundles TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The installation of NMA agent from package ITM for Virtual Environment V7.2.0.3 is failing with both remote or local installation on Linux x86-64. \n\nSYMPTOM\n1) The import of the whole bundle using command: \n\n/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix\n\nwill fail with message:\n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\n--\n\n2) Even if you succeed in importing the bundle, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).\n\n--\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2.\nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. \n\nAnyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. \n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. \n\n--------------- \n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>22</Release>\n\n<Mod>04</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>30</Release>\n\n<Mod>05</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). \nThe quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally

We don't see any messages in our SIB queues and there are no failed events. We have been told not to delete the tranlogs. If that is the case, what is the best way to delete this transaction? 10:29 What settings can I follow to ensure I don't end up with huge depth of messages in my SIB callback destinations? 12:48 What are the key parameters that need to be tuned for better performance with asynchronous SCA invocation in WebSphere Process Server? 13:42 Is there a big difference in terms of performance overhead in an asynchronous inter-module interaction vs asynchronous intra-module interaction. Should the former be avoided? 14:58 I want to understand which queues are created in the context of SCA modules, and what is their purpose? 17:55 How do I interpret messages that are parked in queue and what do I do with them? 21:35 What level of control do I have over MQMD header fields in an outgoing message from an MQ import. What fields can I set and how can I set them? 25:26 We have a long running process (Module A) making synchronous calls to a SCA Import (Module B). We are aware of the fact that it is not a good practice to make synchronous calls from LR BPEL. However we would like to know the expected behavior for the invocation activity in case the related transaction timeout expires. We observe that if Module B provides a response after the \u201ctransaction timeout\u201d of the invoke activity, then the BPEL successfully navigates to the next activity. This will happen after a small delay. No exceptions are raised for the BPEL to catch and there are no double messages towards Module B. Is this the expected behavior? 28:24 We have a long running process (Module A) making asynchronous calls to a SCA Import (Module B). If Module B provides the response after the \u201ctransaction timeout\u201d of the invoke activity, we observe that Module B is unable to sent back the response to Module A. It seems to us that the SCA is having problems getting a connection to SIBus as a consequence of the transaction having timed out and the SCA code is retrying the connections for a long time before eventually throwing a CWSCA2001E error (SCA unable to establish connection to SIB/ME in xxx secs). The call/initial request afterwards is re-tried resulting in duplicate messages towards Module B. Is this the expected behavior? If so, what would you recommend us to do to overcome this issue? 31:32 I have set a \"Request expiration\" qualifier. After the expiration time, does the request get moved to the Failed Event Manager or any other exception queues? 34:22 We see a huge depth in one of the SIB queues and suspect it might be causing performance problems. What is the fastest way to deal with such an issue? 36:40 When I click on Application and then the SCA modules from the admin console, it takes an enormous amount of time for the list to display, and after displaying all the SCA applications, clicking on Mediation applications also take a long time to display its properties. Do you have any advice on this? 38:30 I have a WebServices import, which fails after several retries, where does the message go to? 42:36 Do you have any tips on how to tune my BPC explorer applications to avoid out-of-memory problems? 43:20 I am trying to achieve multithreading in a SCA module, and I set MaxConcurrency and MaxBatchSize to 1, and I am having a problem because I am seeing concurrent processing with dfferent messages - am I doing something wrong? 46:37 Closing remarks 47:06 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Pamela Fong Senior Software Engineer - WebSphere Process Server Development Jeff Brent Senior Engineer - WebSphere Process Server SWAT Alex Wood Software Engineer - WPS/WESB Development Lalitha Chandran Software Engineer - WebSphere Process Server Technical Support team \n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-01042011-OpenMic-TroubleshootingSCAProblemsinWebSphereProcessServer-Chandran.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020512&aid=2] WSTE-01042011-OpenMic-TroubleshootingSCAProblemsinWebSphereProcessServer-Chandran.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020512&aid=1]\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this 47 minutes conference call, click on Download Audio [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/Jan-04-2011-Chandran.mp3] (5.0MB - audio in MP3 format).

      "v612rnotes; v62rnotes; Event Sequencing; Maximum Failed Deliveries; SCA retry; SCA destination; SCA message TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When installing a module to WebSphere Process Server, some queues are created on the Service Component Architecture (SCA) System Bus for internal message processing. If you want to modify the retry value for internal SCA messages, you need to change the value \"Maximum Failed Deliveries\" for the particular destination. Generally, it is possible to adjust this value at runtime. However, if Event Sequencing is in place, there is a limitation to this: Modifications to the Maximum Failed Deliveries value are not picked up at runtime. \n\nSYMPTOM\nIn case of a failure, SCA messages are not retried according to the new value but the retry count remains at the previously defined value.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe Event Sequencing consumer caches the \"Maximum Failed Deliveries\" value for the SCA component destination. Therefore updates during runtime are not picked up. It would cost too much in performance to modify this behavior, such that it accepts changes during runtime.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThis issue applies to every environment where Event Sequencing is configured.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nYou need to restart the according module after making the change to the \"Maximum Failed Deliveries\" parameter of the SCA destination. Then, the new set value is used for the Event Sequencing processing.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n WebSphere Process Server V7: Processing events [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.websphere.wps.doc/doc/eventsequence/cadm_eventsequence_ovw.html]\nWebSphere Application Server V7: Queue settings [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/SIBQueue_DetailForm.html]\nWebSphere Process Server Exception handling [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0705_fong/0705_fong.html]\nWebSphere ESB V7: Managing resources for mediation [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.websphere.wesb.doc/concepts/cwesb_res_admin.html]\n\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WPS",
      "SAP; Adapter; SCA; inbound; shutdown; listener; JR50439; endpoint; j2c TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The WebSphere SAP Adapter in inbound mode may still receive inbound requests (IDOCs) from SAP Server and send them to the endpoint while the SCA application is shutting down. This may cause errors while messages are processed in the SCA runtime as the SCA application's resources are being cleared. \n\nCAUSE\nWhen a stop command is issued for the SAP Adapter inbound SCA application that used the inbound SAP Adapter, one of the steps is deactivating the SAP Adapter endpoint and thus terminating the SAP Adapter listeners. This prevents IDOCs reaching the SAP Adapter. \nBecause the application shutdown is asynchronous, there may be a time gap between the time when the IDOCs stop flowing in and the point when the SCA module stops, especially during high IDOC load. In this case some IDOCs may still reach the SCA layer while at the same time the SCA application's resources are being cleared. This causes incorrect message processing, and faulty messages are put on the internal SCA queues. When the SCA application is started again, the messages present in the internal SCA queues will not process correctly and Failed Events are created that are not resubmittable. \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe proper SAP Adapter quiesce method for a planned outage is to: \n\n1) Pause the SAP Adapter endpoints which terminates the listeners, preventing IDOCs reaching the BPM runtime. \n\n2) Shut down the SCA application manually without any loss of data. \n\n\nIf the SCA application is stopped without first pausing the adapter, BPM APAR JR50439 addresses errors that can occur. This APAR resolves the problems by throwing an exception when the SCA runtime detects that it is processing a request while the application is stopping. By throwing an exception the SAP Adapter transaction will roll back. \nIt is strongly recommended to apply JR50439 to BPM runtime. \n\nEven with this Interim Fix in place, it is still safer to pause the SAP Adapter before shutting down the SCA application because this will reduce the likelihood of errors and transaction rollback. \n\nPausing the SAP Adapter endpoint is achieved through wsadmin scripting interface. It is currently not possible to do that step through the WAS Administration Console. \n\nReference the following article that provides instructions on how to find the correct endpoint and how to pause/resume it:\n\n\"Monitoring the WebSphere J2C adapter polling thread in a WebSphere Process Server environment\", section \"Monitoring the J2C message endpoint\" - \nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/tutorials/1206_nasser/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/tutorials/1206_nasser/]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Monitoring the WebSphere J2C adapter polling thread...

The following stack trace shows an example of the problem:\n\nMethod enlist caught javax.transaction.RollbackException: Transaction rolled back\nat com.ibm.ws.Transaction.JTA.TransactionImpl.enlistResource(TransactionImpl.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ws.Transaction.JTA.TranManagerSet.enlist(TranManagerSet.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ejs.j2c.XATransactionWrapper.enlist(XATransactionWrapper.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ejs.j2c.ConnectionManager.lazyEnlist(ConnectionManager.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.impl.SibRaManagedConnection.getContainerTransaction(SibRaManagedConnection.java:734)\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.impl.SibRaConnection.getContainerTransaction(SibRaConnection.java:1628)\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.impl.SibRaConnection.mapTransaction(SibRaConnection.java:1730)\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.impl.SibRaConsumerSession.receiveNoWait(SibRaConsumerSession.java:158)\nat com.ibm.ws.sca.internal.async.sib.SIBAsyncHandler.receiveMessage(SIBAsyncHandler.java:669)\nat com.ibm.ws.sca.internal.async.sib.SIBAsyncHandler.retrieveStoredMessage(SIBAsyncHandler.java:364)\nat com.ibm.ws.sca.internal.async.impl.AbstractAsyncInboundHandler.processLastRetryMessage(AbstractAsyncInboundHandler.java:297)\nat com.ibm.wsspi.sca.async.bean.impl.ServiceSIBusMessageBean.processMessage(ServiceSIBusMessageBean.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.wsspi.sca.async.bean.impl.ServiceSIBusMessageBean.access$000(ServiceSIBusMessageBean.java(Inlined Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.wsspi.sca.async.bean.impl.ServiceSIBusMessageBean$1.onMessage(ServiceSIBusMessageBean.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.wbiserver.manualrecovery.ejb.RecoveryMDBHandler.onMessage(RecoveryMDBHandler.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.wsspi.sca.async.bean.impl.ServiceSIBusMessageBean.onMessage(ServiceSIBusMessageBean.java(Compiled Code))\nat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor98.invoke(Unknown Source)\nat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java(Compiled Code))\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ejs.container.MessageEndpointHandler.invokeMdbMethod(MessageEndpointHandler.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ejs.container.MessageEndpointHandler.invoke(MessageEndpointHandler.java(Compiled Code))\nat $Proxy12.onMessage(Unknown Source)\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.inbound.impl.SibRaEndpointInvokerImpl.invokeEndpoint(SibRaEndpointInvokerImpl.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.inbound.impl.SibRaDispatcher.dispatch(SibRaDispatcher.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ws.sib.ra.inbound.impl.SibRaSingleProcessListener$SibRaWork.run(SibRaSingleProcessListener.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ejs.j2c.work.WorkProxy.run(WorkProxy.java(Compiled Code))\nat com.ibm.ws.util.ThreadPool$Worker.run(ThreadPool.java(Compiled Code))\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe SCA creates stored messages to capture runtime exception details. These messages are later retrieved for reporting purposes. If a system failure occurs during message retrieval (a failure that is caused by an unstable system environment, an out-of-memory situation, a lost database connection, and so on), stored messages might be left in the SCA module destination.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen you suspect that stored messages are stuck in the SCA module destination, check the system log for relevant stack traces. For example, the system log indicates that a problem occurred at a time that correlates to the age of the stuck message. \n\nIf you see the method SIBAsyncHandler.retrieveStoredMessage in the stack trace, the SCA has encountered a problem while retrieving stored messages.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nStored messages do not contain business data. They can be safely deleted or moved to another queue. \n\n\nTo locate the stuck stored messages, follow these steps:\n\n\n 1. Look in the message dumps, including in SCA headers from the SCA module destination. \n 2. Check for the property scaStoredMsgId. If it is not null and has an associated value, then it is a stored message. \n 3. Note of the age of the messages. \n 4. Allow sufficient time for the messages to be processed. The amount of time depends on the application content and the server retry configuration. Following is a formula to use to compute the approximate life span of a stored message:\n    \n    Lifespan = X * Y * Z \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n * \n\n\nUse caution when deleting or moving messages from the SCA module destination so that you do not accidentally delete messages that contain business data. If you have a question or are unsure about determining whether the message is a stored message, contact IBM Software Support. For performing actions such as gathering message dumps and moving messages to a temporary queue, you can use the SIBDestination tool.

      "BRMS; XOM; BOM; jrules; ruleset; rule studio; rule; getter TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to check for null values in ruleset to prevent NullPointerExceptions during the rule execution? \n\nCAUSE\n Checking for null values and initializing them is a necessary step in the implementation of a ruleset, because input objects might be null or contain null values.\nFor any Java application, rules developers must implement checks for null values on the objects used in the application (within rules in the case of JRules) to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions (NPEs) such as the following:\n\nException in thread \"main\" \nAn exception IlrUserRuntimeException has been thrown:\nTarget method: public int java.lang.String.indexOf(java.lang.String) \n\n * at condition part of rule 'test.myRule' \n * \n * at call to 'main#myTask rule task body' \n * \n * at call to 'main flow task body' \n * \n * at call to 'execute'\n\nTarget exception stack trace: \njava.lang.NullPointerException: null object when invoking public int java.lang.String.indexOf(java.lang.String)  * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecMethodValue.getValue(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecBinaryTest.evaluate(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.o.evaluate(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrDiscMem.if(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrSingleDiscMem.k(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrCustomDiscMem.f(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrAlphaMem.new(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrRuleMem.T(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrAgenda.a(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrEngine.fireAgendaRules(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecRuleTask.a(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecRuleTask.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecTask.run(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecTaskInstance.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.executeItem(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.executeSubFlow(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecFlowTask.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecTask.run(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.inset.IlrExecTaskInstance.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.executeItem(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.if(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrTaskEngine.a(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrContext.a(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.engine.IlrContext.execute(Unknown Source)\n * \n * at ilog.rules.studio.launching.main.IlrMain.main(IlrMain.java:184)\n\n\n\nObjects used in the rules are either input parameter objects or objects that have been inserted in the working memory. \n\nThe rule developer must check that none of the input parameters are null, unless they are of a Java primitive type. \n\nIndeed, if a parameter 'customer', verbalized as 'the customer' and of type test.Customer, is null and a rule author writes the following condition: \n * if\n * \n *  the age of the customer is more than 21 \n\n\nIt translates in IRL (ILOG Rules Language) into the following statement, and produces an NPE on 'customer.age' because 'customer' is null: \n * evaluate (customer.age > 21);\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, null objects are not inserted in the working memory, so they will never be bound in the rules. Therefore, the rule developer does not have to check if the working memory objects themselves are null. \n\n\nWhether the object used in a rule is a parameter or a working memory object, the rule developer must check for nulls on its attributes and method return values of the following types: \n *  Java wrapper types (i.e. java.lang.Integer, java.lang.BigDecimal...) \n *  java.lang.String \n *  Custom types\n\n\nOnly values of Java primitive types such as int and float cannot be null and therefore do not need to be checked. \n\nNote that even if an attribute is found on the right-hand side of a comparison, it might generate an NPE if it is null. This can be due to the automatic unboxing of Java wrapper types, see the documentation for JRules 7.1 at Rule Studio > Optimizing execution > Run-time efficiency > Autoboxing [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global770.html]. \n\nFor example, the following condition: \n * if \n * \n *  the age of the customer is less than the age limit of the exam \n\n\nIs translated as follows in IRL: \n * evaluate (person.age > exam.ageLimit.intValue());\n\n\n\nWhere 'ageLimit' is a java.lang.Integer implicitly unboxed to its Java primitive type 'int' to allow the comparison to 'age' which is of type 'int'. This is the same mechanism used in Java 5 when comparing a primitive type and its wrapper type. \n\nANSWER\nThe check for null values can be performed before any rule is executed or while the rules are being executed. \n\n\n\nIn any case, because the notion of null value is a technical concept, the task of checking for nulls must remain in the hands of the rule application developer.\n\nIt should not be the responsibility of rule authors when they are writing rules, as they are likely to be business analysts for whom the notion of null values is abstract.\n\nTherefore, the check performed during the rule execution must be done implicitly: rule authors write the phrases that make sense to them from a business point of view and have checks for nulls performed in the background at execution time.\n\n\"is null\"/\"is not null\" operators are available in BAL rules, but are not valid or available for all types. Again, business users might not know programming concepts such as null values and the order of test evaluations to use them. \n\nIn addition, rule authors would not be able to fully rely on the order in which the conditions are written in an 'and' clause, to know the order in which they will be executed. That is explained in this other technote [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458494]. They could not be sure that the check for null values is executed before other tests that can potentially generate NPEs.\n\n\nTo check for nulls in the ruleset, before the rules are executed, you do the following:\n\n\n * use the initial actions of the ruleflow. \n   \n\nTo check for nulls while the rules are being executed, you can do the following: \n * use testers on BOM objects, \n * override operators, \n * override BOM getters & methods.\n\n\n\nThe choice of a solution will depend on the application and its requirements. \n\nOverriding operators might be less time consuming because it applies to both ruleset parameters and working memory objects. The other methods might be more tedious if the Business Object Model (BOM) contains numerous and complex classes. \n\nOn the other hand, the method of overriding operators to consider a condition 'false' if any of the data is null, only prevents potential NPE in the condition. However, it does not prevent getting NPEs in the action part of the rule ('then' or 'else'). \n\nThe use of the initial actions, if you choose to continue the execution, does not cover the case when values become null during the rule execution, either through some rule actions or an external application. \n\n\nMost methods offer the possibility to set the null value to a default non-null value and go on with the execution or evaluation, while other possibilities are to choose not to execute the ruleset (initial actions), not to use the object in rules (tester), or have the condition return false (overriding operators), whenever a value is null. \n\n * Each solution is explained below, as well as illustrated in a sample attached to this document\n * \n * \n *  Using the initial actions Using testers on BOM classes Overriding operators Overriding BOM getters & methods \n\n\n\n * To see the sample projects, extract the content of the attached zip file in one folder and import all projects in a new workspace. Refer to the readme.txt inside each project for instructions on how to test the scenario that illustrates the approach to test for null values.\n\n\n-------------------- \n\n\n1. Using the initial actions \n\nThe initial actions of the ruleflow are edited in the start node. The test is written in IRL code, either directly in the Initial Actions or in one or more ruleset functions called there. \n\nThe test goes through the ruleset input parameters (using getParameterValue(...)) and/or the objects present in working memory (using getObjects(...)). See the IlrContext API documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/engine/IlrContext.html] for information on those two methods. \n\nSee the JRules 7.1 documentation at Rule Studio > Orchestrating ruleset execution > Working with ruleflows > Adding initial actions [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global476.html] and Rule Studio > Creating rule projects > Creating a function [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global407.html] on how to set initial actions and use a function to write the IRL code. \n\n\nThis method allows to check if any attribute or method return value is null, or if the parameters themselves are null, in order to initialize the attributes and parameters, or choose not to execute rules by exiting the ruleflow. The last option is the most reliable option to prevent any NPE, because the fact that a method returns null can not be altered at that point. In any case, this method cannot prevent the fact that values may become null later during the rule execution, either through some rule actions or an external application. \n\n\nThe project \"initial-action-approach\" in the attached zip archive illustrates this approach. \n\n\n\n2. Using testers on BOM classes \n\nIn this approach, the rule developer adds a tester to the BOM class to perform the check for null values in order to ensure that only objects without null attributes nor methods returning a null value are bound in the rules. \n\nWhenever an object is bound in a rule and that the corresponding BOM class has a tester, the latter is analyzed to determine if the object instance is eligible. \n\nIn this case, it depends on whether or not it contains null values. The tester function returns 'true' if the instance is eligible to be bound to a rule instance, and 'false' otherwise. If the tester returns 'false', the object is not bound in a rule instance. This prevents a potential NPE during the execution. \n\nFor example if the BOM contains a test.Customer class with one attribute, 'name', of type java.lang.String, the following tester should be added to the test.Customer BOM class: \n * return this.name != null;\n\n\n\nIn the case of attributes, you could alternatively choose to initialize nulls to default values based on your own criteria and have the tester return 'true'. \n\nFor more information on testers, see section Rule Studio > Creating rule projects > Defining how business elements map to the XOM > Mapping classes > Adding tests to filter out class instances [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global424.html] of the JRules 7.1 documentation. \n\n\nThis method handles objects inserted in the working memory. If your ruleset also has parameters of a BOM type, you could choose to insert those into the working memory in the initial actions of the ruleflow. You must then not verbalize these parameters so that your rules only bind them from the working memory using automatic variables (see section Rule Studio > Writing rules > Automatic variables [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global488.html] of the JRules 7.1 documentation). This allows to use the tester of the corresponding BOM classes to check for null values on those parameters as well. \n\n\nThe project \"tester-approach\" in the attached zip archive illustrates this approach. \n\n\n\n3. Overriding operators \n\nHere, the rule developer overrides basic operators on numbers and strings by creating static virtual BOM methods (for example on an utility class ) with the corresponding parameters and give them the verbalization of those operators. \n\nFor example, to override the \"is less than\" operator for numbers, the BOM method would look as follows: \n * sample.NumberUtility.isLessThan (java.lang.Number, java.lang.Number)\n\n\nThis method woud be verbalized as follows: \n * {0} is less than {1}\n\n\n\nThe verbalization is key to allow the new BOM method to be called in place of the default operator in the IRL code, without rule authors having to change the way that they write the rule. \n\nFor example, the following condition: \n * the age of the customer is less than the age limit of the exam\n\n\nwould be translated as follows in IRL: \n * evaluate (sample.NumberUtility.isLessThan(person.age , exam.ageLimit));\n\n\n\ninstead of \n * evaluate (person.age > exam.ageLimit.intValue()); \n\n\n * \n * sample.NumberUtility.isLessThan(...)\n * \n * \n * \n * if(number1 != null && number2 != null){\n *  return number1.doubleValue() < number2.doubleValue(); \n * }\n * \n * return false;\n\n\n\nTo know more about the BOM to XOM mapping, see the documentation at Rule Studio > Creating rule projects > BOM and XOM [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global374.html] for JRules 7.1. \n\nSee the section Rule Studio > Creating rule projects > Defining a vocabulary > Editing and creating phrases > Editing a phrase [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global440.html] of the JRules 7.1. documentation for how to modify the method verbalization. \n\n\nThis method requires to override all operators of Numbers to check for null values on both sides of the operation, because of the possibility of auto-unboxing, and all operators of String (except \"is null\"/\"is not null\" or \"is one of\"/\"is not one of\") to check for null values on the left hand side of the comparison. \n\n\nThe project \"operator-overriding-approach\" in the attached zip archive illustrates this approach. \n\n\n\n4. Overriding BOM getters and methods \n\nThe rule developer overrides getters and methods of the BOM by writing BOM to XOM (B2X) code to test the value before returning it to the rule execution. \n\nFor example if the BOM contains a test.Customer class with one attribute, 'name', of type java.lang.String, the following B2X code for the getter could be: \n * if (this.name!=null)\n *  return this.name; \n * else\n *  return \"\"; \n\n\nEvery time the attribute is read, whether it is on a parameter or on a working memory object, and whether it is in the condition part, action part or another part of the rule, a null value is replaced with \"\" to avoid any NPE. \n\nTo know more about the BOM to XOM mapping, see the documentation at Rule Studio > Creating rule projects > BOM and XOM [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global374.html] for JRules 7.1. \n\n\nThis method requires to write B2X code for all verbalized BOM getters (plus corresponding getters) and methods returning a value. The only possibility here is to return a default non-null value if a null value is found. \n\n\nThe project \"getter-overriding-approach\" in the attached zip archive illustrates this approach. check null samples.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585612&aid=2]check null samples.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585612&aid=1] \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise",

You might also be interested in IBM redbook SG24-4949-00, \"Security on the Web Using DCE Technology\", specifically chapter 8 (DCE over Firewalls), although that information is somewhat dated (it was written in June 1997) and some details are AIX-specific.\n\nBy \"firewall\", we mean a creature (either software or hardware, or both) that filters network traffic based on some configurable set of rules that usually restrict protocols or ports for incoming and/or outgoing traffic. Usually, incoming traffic is more heavily restricted. The term \"packet-filtering router\" is sometimes used to describe the type of firewall that we consider in this note. \n\nFor example, many organizations have firewalls installed on the router machines that connect their internal networks to the Internet. These firewalls might be configured to prevent incoming connections to any ports except for the organization's web server and ftp server ports. In more complex environments, traffic from the outside to the inside of the organization might have to pass through multiple firewalls, each with a different set of rules. For example, there might be a firewall between the outside world and the company's web/FTP server machine(s), and then a second firewall might sit between the web/FTP server machine(s) and the company's internal network. \n\nIn general, the issue with firewalls is that they only allow certain defined types of traffic to pass through them. If a DCE application consists of a client on one side of a firewall and a server on the other side, then the firewall and DCE must be configured in a way that allows the DCE traffic to pass. For example, if the web server mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph is a DCE client (perhaps talking to a DCE server to do some sort of database work in order to do its job), the total communications path might be: web browser on outside machine -> first firewall -> web server -> second firewall -> DCE server on internal network -> back-end database. Since the DCE RPC traffic passes through the second firewall, the firewall must be configured so as to allow DCE traffic to pass. \n\nTypically this requires the firewall administrator to modify the rules in order to \"open up\" the ports that DCE needs, and it requires the DCE administrator to take steps to make DCE's port usage predictable enough to satisfy the firewall administrator. This note concentrates on the latter problem: how a DCE administrator can control port usage of his/her applications so appropriate firewall rules can be constructed. \n\nThis problem is non-trivial because DCE clients and servers use \"dynamic\" port numbers. That is, if you stop and start a DCE CDS server five times, the server will almost always listen for connection requests on a different port each time it comes up. In fact, the CDS server will typically listen on two diffferent ports each time it comes up: one UDP port and one TCP port. \n\nThis is in contrast to other services like say a web server that always listens on TCP port 80, or the FTP service that always uses TCP ports 20 and 21. Firewall admins are fond of services like these, ones that have predictable port usage. They hate services like DCE's, where the only predictable ports are the ones used by the endpoint mapper. (The endpoint mapper daemon always uses TCP and UDP ports 135; and of course it's the endpoint mapper on each machine who keeps track of the ports that other DCE servers use, so clients can learn which ports their servers are using at the moment). \n\nThis note describes a few environment variables that can be used to make DCE act more like a web server or a FTP server, in that DCE services (including customer-written DCE applications) can be made to listen on more predictable ports so firewall administrators can control DCE traffic as precisely as they can control other types of traffic. In a nutshell, we will describe how to restrict DCE services to a particular range of port numbers which can be opened by the firewall guy. (We still may not be able to predict for sure which DCE service is using which port in the range, but we'll be able to specify the set of ports that we need, which is typically good enough.) Most of this note is relevant to sites that use the full set of DCE services, including CDS and security; toward the bottom, we'll explain a few alternative measures that can be used in simpler environments where perhaps all you care about is DCE RPC, without DCE security or CDS. \n\n\nThe RPC_ Environment Variables\n\nThere are three different environment variables that can be used to help DCE work in conjunction with firewalls: \n\n1. RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS: this can be used to limit DCE RPC traffic to a particular protocol, either TCP or UDP. Sometimes, firewall policy is that only TCP traffic is allowed, and no UDP traffic at all is permitted to flow from outside the company to inside. If this is the case at your site, then you would set RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS to ncacn_ip_tcp.\n\n2. RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS: this can be used to limit the range of ports used by DCE programs. It restricts both client-side and server-side ports, so it's useful if you have restrictions in place that control both incoming and outgoing port numbers. You can set it to something like this in order to specify that TCP ports be chosen from the range 2000-2999, and UDP ports be chosen from 4000-4499: \nncacn_ip_tcp[2000-2999]:ncadg_ip_udp[4000-4499] \n\nYou must not specify a protseq in RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS if you have set RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS to exclude that protseq. That is, if you set RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS to only ncacn_ip_tcp, then you must not mention ncadg_ip_udp in your setting of RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS. \n\nOne serious problem with RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS is that it's not possible in general to determine exactly how many client-side ports a DCE process will use, so it's not possible to set RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS precisely -- that is, it's not possible to guarantee that the entire port range specified will actually be used. You have to allow at least 100 to 200 ports in order to be sure that DCE can do its normal work, and you have to allow additional ports in busier cells. This is very bad from a firewall admin's perspective, since you will be asking him to open up this big range of ports, but you won't know for certain that you'll actually be using them -- so in theory, some hacker could try to get in via one of the open ports that you're not using. \n\nLuckily, firewall administrators often don't care about which ports you use for outgoing traffic -- they just want to be able to control which ports are used by incoming traffic. If that's the case at your site, then the next variable will be of use, and you will not want to use RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS at all... \n\n\n3. RPC_RESTRICTED_SERVER_PORTS: this one has the same syntax as RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS, but it affects only your servers' listening ports. So, if for example you have a DCE machine with a security server and two application servers, then you will need to specify a range of only 4 ports: one for the security server, one for the local CDS advertiser, and 2 for the application servers. (The endpoint mapper will use port 135 regardless of the setting of the RPC_RESTRICTED_ variables.) Your firewall person can now restrict incoming traffic to just port 135 and the 4 ports in the range you set via RPC_RESTRICTED_SERVER_PORTS, and everyone is happy. \n\nRPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS is an OSF-standard variable, so it appears in every vendor's version of DCE, while the RPC_RESTRICTED_ variables were added later by various vendors and may not be available on all platforms. Specifically, RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS appears in DCE versions 1.1 and higher on Solaris 2.4 and higher, and in AIX DCE 2.1 and higher on AIX 4.1 and higher. RPC_RESTRICTED_SERVER_PORTS was introduced in patch 43 for DCE 1.1 on Solaris 2.5, in patch 4 for DCE 2.0 on Solaris 2.6, and in the base distributions of DCE 3.1 for Solaris 7 and 8 and for AIX. Check with your DCE support organization if you have questions about the availability of these variables on your specific platforms. \n\nIn order for these environment variables to be effective, they must be set for every DCE process on the machine(s) of interest. There are several ways to achieve this, depending on your platform. \n\nAs always, you should contact your DCE support rep if you have questions about any of this stuff. Happily, it's pretty easy to verify that these variables are doing what you want them to do, just by inspection of the local endpoint map. (Use dcecp -c endpoint show to see the endpoint map on your local machine.) You should be able to play with them and get things working properly on a test machine, so you don't have to bother your firewall team while you're figuring out how to get the control you want. \n\n\nAlternative: Well-Known Endpoints\n\nAll the comments above are directed toward DCE administrators who have full-blown DCE cells that use CDS and security in the usual ways, and whose application servers use the normal DCE dynamic endpoints. However, if your own DCE environment is simpler than that, you may not need to use these RPC_ variables at all. \n\nIf the only DCE traffic that crosses your firewall consists of application RPCs (i.e., no CDS or security work done across the firewall), then you might want to just code the application to be firewall-friendly itself. You could for example use the technique of \"well-known endpoints\" in your server, so it would act kind of like a web server or an FTP server that always listens on the same port. If you do this, then you know exactly which port your firewall has to open, and you don't need to open port 135 for the endpoint mapper since your application client won't even have to look up an endpoint.\n\nA hackish way to accomplish essentially the same thing would be to programatically set the RPC_RESTRICTED_SERVER_PORTS variable in your server program, specifying a range of just one port -- then you'd know for sure which port your server would use. Your client could use a string binding instead of CDS to obtain a binding handle to the server; if you have no need for DCE security, then this would be another way to limit your application to using just one port through the firewall. \n\n\nNAT Firewalls\n\nWe should mention that some firewalls can employ a \"network address translation\" (NAT) feature that hides internal IP addresses from external users. I've also heard the term \"IP masquerading\" used for this technique. \n\nDCE applications will probably fail if they are run through such an address-translating firewall, because some DCE RPC packets contain the IP address of the sender. If the firewall re-maps/hides/translates addresses such that the recipient of the DCE RPC packet cannot actually use the IP address that appears in the packet, then the RPC facility will almost certainly fail. \n\nThere's an Internet RFC that discusses NAT, RFC 1631. It makes this comment in section 3.3 on Header Manipulations: \n\nIn addition to modifying the IP address, NAT must modify the IP checksum and the TCP checksum. Remember, TCP's checksum also covers a pseudo header which contains the source and destination address. NAT must also look out for ICMP and FTP and modify the places where the IP address appears. There are undoubtedly other places, where modifications must be done. Hopefully, most such applications will be discovered during experimentation with NAT. \nAt this point, we have discovered that DCE is another application where modifications must be done... \n\nIn order for a NAT firewall to work with DCE, the firewall would have to be DCE-aware. Specifically, it would have to modify DCE RPC packets on the fly, in such a way as to make them consistent with the addressing scheme that it maintains. Read section 3.3 of the RFC, where the mods for FTP are discussed, to get an idea of the scope of the problem. As the NAT RFC says later in section 3.3: \n\n\"Any application that carries (and uses) the IP address inside the application will not work through NAT unless NAT knows of such instances and does the appropriate translation. It is not possible or even necessarily desirable for NAT to know of all such applications.\"\n\nDCE would seem to fall into this category of application. We have had a few customers attempt to use DCE with NAT firewalls, but as far as we know, none have succeeded. (We would love to hear from customers who have made it work, though; or from customers who know of DCE-aware NAT firewalls!) \n\nUpdate, June 2000: We have a report from a customer who has had success with DCE over a NAT firewall. Checkpoint's \"Products and Solutions\" web page says that their Secure VPN architecture supports DCE RPC, and the customer reports that it does seem to work. (This is not an endorsement or a support guarantee, as we have not tested or used this VPN product ourselves, and the web page refers to Microsoft's implementation of DCE; but it's an interesting tidbit... since Microsoft's DCE implementation is supposed to be wire-compatible with other implementations, in theory it seems that this could work.)",

Can someone tell me how to make sure all rules are removed from a users mail database?  * There are a few ways. If you look at the database in Notespeek, rules are called $Filterformula. if there are none of those, there are no rules. In Notespeek you would find the $FilterFormulas under \"Calendar Profile\". \n\n * Here is a link for Notespeek - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24005686 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24005686]\n\n * You can also check the rules view. If there are no rules there, the only other place they can exist is in the CalendarProfile document. If you delete this calendarprofile doc, it will remove the order in which they run in the background, in case there is no actual rule document but it's still running in the background\n\n\n\nQ2. Is it possible to mix different version Domino in the same cluster? \nYes. We do recommend that your Admin server is the higher version of all the servers. \n\n\nQ3. Is it also recommended to mix let's say 32-bit Domino with 64-bit Domino? \nYou can have different versions of Domino. It tends to be easier to administer if you keep your Domino versions the same. For example, if you have an issue where you need to get a fix, you're not patching multiple server versions. If you streamline, then you tend to run all the same versions and if one server has an issue you can patch them all at once. \n\n\nQ4. Is it safe to delete the old server names in the domain catalog database? \nYes it is okay to delete old server names from the Domain catalog. \n\n\nQ5. How can I get rid of already decommissioned servers in the drop down list of 'open Application' window's 'Look in:' bar? \nI think if the databases appear anywhere on your Workspace they appear in the list. For example, if you stack your replicas and the old servers are buried in amongst them. \n\n\nQ6. Is there a preference in the client or policy that can prevent calendar items in mail databases from being archived or falling away after date has passed?  * Calendar documents generally don't get archived unless you run the Calendar Clean-up tool. \n * You can select only the folder and views in the archive settings that you would like to archive from. Be sure to not select the Calendar.\n\n\n\nQ7. What is a good resource(s) on setting up and implementing ID vault? Not sure where to start so looking for guidance.  * Technote 1407232 - Replay and Questions/Answers from the Open Mic \"Lotus Domino ID Vault\" call of October 22 2009 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021208] \n * Notes ID Vault deployment content on the Notes/Domino Wiki - http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpSearch.xsp?searchValue=Notes%20ID%20vault%20deployment [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpSearch.xsp?searchValue=Notes%20ID%20vault%20deployment]\n\n\n\nQ8. Currently I dig through Activity Trends to find inactive accounts? Is there a better way or some way to set up a report that will notify me? \nHow to find unused databases and remove them? The Activity Trends database has a Databases / Inactivity view. Also you can create an database event - monitor for user inactivity. \n\n\nQ9. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to handle terminated employees' mail files? We still would like to receive email since many people still email to the user for a set time, but we would like to get people to stop sending to this person.  * We add the former user's email address to another user's Person doc, User Name field. Mail to the former user gets delivered to the current user. We also move the former user's mail database to our archive server which doesn't have SMTP or CalConn, etc. running on it. \n * You could forward email from the terminated user to someone else, and also auto reply to tell sender user is no longer with company - new contact is... \n * We remove the Mail file and user and add the mail address as an alias to whatever user is responsible. Also you could set up a rule / agent to respond to any inbound e-mails and alert them that the e-mail address will cease soon. \n * Another option is to \"hide\" the Person document associated with this mail file. They will no longer appear for internal mail delivery, but the document remains active and the ROUTER can deliver incoming external mail. Steps below:  1. Locate the person document in the names.nsf you wish to hide. \n    2. Select the person document and bring up the Document properties. \n    3. Click on the \"key\" TAB. \n    4. De-select the \"All readers and above\" check box. \n    5. In the list of users below, be sure that the Administrator of the server and the server itself are in the reader's field list. Add any users you wish to be able to \"see\" this person document. \n    6. To stop mail coming from the internet to this user, ensure the \"Internet Address\" field of the person document is blank. \n    7. You may have to restart the server for all these changes to take effect.\n   \n   \n\n\n\nQ10. I never worked with Web services yet. Do you guys have some material to start reading? Is that with Java code?  * http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/web-services2/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/web-services2/] \n * I would start with the Domino Designer Help. There is a good general description of what web services are, SOAP, etc.\n\n\n\nQ11. Is there a way to configure a maximum attachment size on the client rather than just on the server at the router? What happens is if a user sends a 500MB file it sits there and gets replicated up to the server before it gets rejected and even then it stays in the mail file and gets replicated around, which is a real pain. \n * Normally you could create a server rule to block it, but that would be server. I'm not sure on the replication part, I would think that it should fail as well without even depositing to mail.box. You could create a server rule that would automatically reject it on the send if you were on the server copy. \n\n * So I did a test. If you do put a mail rule in place on the server, what will end up happening is that when you go to replicate it will say that mail rule size has been exceeded. So the document has been rejected by the mail rule. If you wanted to put a size limitation for your messages, you could create a mail rule on the server in the Server Configuration document (value is in bytes). So when the client goes to replicate up or tries to send that outgoing message, it will say that it has been rejected by a mail rule and it will not get deposited into the mail.box.\n\n\n\nQ12. We need to run Java agents, essentially, and share class code with beans and things that are on XPages. That's not currently not really possible. You can do it but it's undesirable the way that it's done. I was wondering if there was any way that we might be able to work around that any better or maybe get something put in that allows us to share code more effectively. \n\nAdditional Background Info: We essentially have a bunch of agents in LotusScript right now that do all manner of back-end processing. We would like to migrate a bunch of that stuff to Java so that we can start moving the whole entire application from LotusScript to Java and leverage the whole environment of XPages more fully that we are now. Right now the only we have to call back-end code is to do Ajax, which is working. But we would like to have a little more tight-end integration from the front-end and the back-end using Java instead of LotusScript. Right now we are kind of stymied in that regard. Is there something we're missing? Does 9 do something that we don't know? Is there something in the pipe that would allow us to do kinda what we use to do with LotusScript in forms and stuff but entirely in Java and XPage space and no LotusSrcipt at all. \n * I know I've seen many XPages that utilize almost exclusively Java and JavaScript. You've got JSPs. But in 853, I don't think we have what you are looking for. I know that there were some improvements to 9 and 9.0.1. \n\n * We also have these new libraries. The Dojo Toolkit has been improved and expanded to include some of the things that you used to have to get off the OpenNTF. So there are some of those classes that you had to custom import into for Java anyway. \n\n * As far as I know there's no reason why you can't have XPages fully Java/JavaScript but getting your code from LotusScript to Java....\n\n\nWe need to run like an agent in Java space instead of running it in LotusScript space. We have all these classes we're building for beans in XPages to access the back-end. That's all easy, it's trivial. Now we want to leverage those same classes that we're building for XPages in order to migrate our agents to Java. And we can't do that because Java agents cannot access the code we already have in the database. \n\nI don't know the answer to your question but we can do some research and post an answer to this question to the transcript. \n\n\nQ13. Is there any kind of definitive install documentation for Sametime 9? I've been upgrading our servers to 9, but I still have the ST server to do. We only use it for chat and meetings, with the community server. But I know that ST9 doesn't have that setup anymore and to just have chat and meetings I would need to have the SSC, WebSphere, DB2 etc. But I have no idea what I really need or how to go about setting it up. And I would be virtualizing this. I did post on the Sametime forum a few days ago, but so far, no responses. Thanks. \n * The Sametime InfoCenter is a great resource. \n\n * This technote provides some info and links. We recommended opening a PMR with the Sametime support team to review the steps since ST 9 does require new elements as you stated. \n\n * \n * Upgrade Central: Plan your upgrade to IBM Sametime 9.0 and Sametime Unified Telephony 9.0\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\niNotes & Notes Browser Plug-in \n\nQ14. How do I get name changes to propagate to ACL, distribution lists, db title, etc if user is iNotes only and has never logged into a full client? \nThe admin4 request for iNotes users can't complete until the iNotes user access the id file, they'll need to perform a secure mail operations, sign / encrypt. \n\n\nQ15. Is there a way to allow iNotes to add calendars other calendars? Currently there is only the Google calendars option listed. \nThere's an unsupported ini you can try iNotes_WA_CalOverlay=3. It exposes the calendar overlay option to list a different URL, but keep in mind this is use at your own risk. \n\n\nQ16. How do you upgrade iNotes mail templates for webmail users? We have hundreds but I thought I'd seen a way to sort by template type somewhere? \n\n * \n * Switches and options that can be used when running Convert command \n\n * You can use the load convert command on the server. You'd just need a list of users who use webmail. You can run the load convert across entire folders, doesn't have to be individual files at a time http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/domino_notes/7.0/help_admin_upgrade7.nsf/89d3962efd85426f85256b870069c0aa/763af0d791519e53852570bb004fff13?OpenDocument [http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/domino_notes/7.0/help_admin_upgrade7.nsf/89d3962efd85426f85256b870069c0aa/763af0d791519e53852570bb004fff13?OpenDocument]\n\n\n * The template for iNotes no longer differs as it did before. Starting with 8, the Mail 8 template is used for both client and iNotes use but if you do have users on the older DWA template, you should be able to create a custom view in the NAB which you can sort by template name. \n\n\n * To upgrade the mail template. \n   Run this command on the server to upgrade the design of all mail databases: \n   load convert -u Mail * mail85.ntf \n   \n   The * is for the FROM template example dwa7.ntf\n   \n\n * If you have upgraded the server using a standard mail template the next time the design task runs the templates will be updated unless you have prohibit design refresh or the design task disabled via the ServerTasksAt1=Catalog,Design\n\n\n\nQ17. We have upgraded most of our environment to 9.0. I was just wondering if a Web mail user's experience is optimized by using the Notes Browser Plug-in, or does that matter? We're just talking using mail rather than additional database that might be on our servers. \n * You used the word optimized...\n\n\nIn a way I'm not really sure what I want because we're sort of thinking ahead. Right now we're sort of evaluating for a lot of reasons if we're going to stay on Domino or if we're going to move to Connections or if we're going to be pushed to go to the entire Exchange/Outlook, etc. platform. So I notice that there's a lot of hype about the Notes Browser Plug-in and I haven't really figured out what it is for, especially for the folks that only use iNotes as opposed to a client, if they should also get installed the plug-in. \n * The Notes Browser Plug-in is basically it is meant for people who use iNotes more but what it does is it's a much lighter solution. Some people need to use iNotes some times and they also need to access Notes database some times so it's a much lighter solution than having a full client. For people who only work in their browser all day, the Notes Browser Plug-in will allow them to access other databases on the server rather than just their mail file. \n\n * If you don't have a lot of heavy client users and you have a lot of iNotes people, the Notes Browser Plug-in doesn't actually display the mail file. When you go to mail in the plug-in, it actually redirects you to iNotes. So they would be using iNotes as they normally were and if they need to access any Notes databases they'll just open them within the Notes Browser Plug-in. \n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nNotes, Admin & Designer clients \n\nQ18. Can someone remind me where the setting is that allows us to control (through policy) which page opens for client users? I set the Discover page to open in 9.0.1 and cannot recall which setting forced that, since there are so many options in each: mail, registration, desktop, etc \nDesktop settings, Basics tab \n\n\nQ19. Is there a way to install the Admin and Designer client on a USB drive so it can be portable? \nUnfortunately the AllClient install isn't supported on USB. \n\n\nQ20. Will you provide a replacement for the web administrator? Mobile friendly. This is deprecated for security reasons and should be reinstated in a secure fashion. \nWe can create an enhancement request requesting a mobile friendly webadmin client. \n\n\nQ21. Are there any plans on releasing a 64 bit version of the client? \nThat is currently an enhancement request. APAR LO34760 \n\n\nQ22. Is there a way to customize to have two different versions of Designer on the same PC? I don't recommend it. I don't know anyone who does that. I wouldn't run 7 and 9 on the same machine. I'm not sure that it's not possible. \n\nIf you had a virtual machine, but not if you just had a Windows machine with two versions of the same box, that's not a good idea. In a virtual environment, yes, you could have as many different versions as you like. \n\n\nQ23. When you go to switch servers in the Admin client, it comes up with a lot of servers that we don't even have any more. How do you clean that list out? \n * In the Admin client, Administration -> Refresh Server Lists -> Current domain or All domains. \n\n * You have to be on the first tab in your Admin client where it's showing your domain and then under Administration, there's a Refresh Server Lists, and you could say Current domain or All domains. \n\n * It will go out to your Domino Directory on your server and if you've removed the servers there, it will remove them from your list and any new ones that you've added it will put in your list. Basically it's cached all those servers in your bookmarks and what that's going to do is update your bookmarks in the background as well with all of the current servers. \n\n\nQ24. (Just tried that) They're still listed there. If I go File -> Open -> Server I still see all my old ones. \nThat's going to be your Desktop file, then. \n\n\nQ25. When you do a refresh of the Files tab (in Designer), it refreshes absolutely everything and then it resets even the folder that you were in. Am I missing something or is that just the way it is? \nThat is just the way that it is. I just verified that again. 8 and 9 does the same thing. You could be in a folder three-levels deep and then you hit the F9 key and that refreshes everything. That gives you a brand new list but, you're right, it takes you back to a different directory. \n\nIf you have a server with a 1000 users and they're all roaming then you've got at least 3000 files that it's going to go through and query and it's a time waster as well. \nIt's trying to get the latest and most updated list of databases and the only way to do that is to dump them all and refresh it all. The more databases you have, the longer it could take. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nNotes Traveler \n\nQ26. Can Domino 9.0.1 run with Traveler 8.5.3? \nDomino 9.0.1 and Traveler 8.5.3 can run on the same environment in the same Domino domain, but you cannot run Traveler 8.5.3 on a Domino 9 server. \n\n\nQ27. Could some one send 901 hf1 Traveler link? \nFor the latest Notes Traveler releases, see technote 4019529 - Index of recommended maintenance for IBM Notes Traveler [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24019529] \n\n\nQ28. I find myself updating or upgrading the Traveler server more than the Domino server over the last few years because of some new device or what have you. This time around iOS 7.1 broke attachments on all of these Apple devices. I guess the fix is to upgrade to Domino 9.0.1 which I cannot do at this point because you have to start with your Admin server and then your mail servers and all that and we have a few customizations on the NAB and it takes a while. My question is, can I upgrade the Traveler server to 9 and Traveler to 9 without messing with the NAB all together. Keeping the NAB on the Traveler server and all the other servers at 8.5.3? \n * Chances are you may be OK but if the Traveler team has put anything in the NAB design that they require for that upgrade, you'd have to at least upgrade the design on the Traveler server. \n\n\n * There's no problems, you don't actually have to upgrade all servers to put the new design of the 90x server in your domain. Internally here I run 90x servers, 85x servers, 70x servers and even 65x servers. I always run them with the latest design of the NAB just to make sure they are backward compatible. \n\n\n * If you had to upgrade the design, you obviously would have to do your customization work first and then upgrade the design and let it go throughout your domain. But there's no reason why you couldn't just upgrade the design of the Traveler server first to 901. Best practices dictate doing your Admin servers first, then your Hub servers, but if you're in a bind and you just need to get that Traveler server upgraded to the latest release you can do it. \n\n\n * Your Traveler server can be upgraded to version 9 and then you can prevent the replication of your names.nsf out to your other Domino servers in your environment, then you would just prevent that replication from happening from your 901 server to the 853 servers. Customers do this all of the time. \n\n\n\nQ29. That's the part that I'm not clear on. If I prevent replication, let's say I've got a new user and I add him on the Admin server, does that mean I'm not replicating anything to the other servers? \nNo, the only thing you want to prevent from replicating are the Design elements. In the Replication settings, unfortunately, probably on all the other servers, you'd have to go in and uncheck the replication of design elements until such a point you where you wanted to allow that to replicate out. But you still want to get the data replicating between the servers. \n\n\nQ30. So I think what I need to find out here, without doing all of this, will it work? If I can keep the Traveler server on 8.5.3 address book, then I will be fine? \nThere are certain views and tabs in the Server document that are updated. For example, if you are using BlackBerry devices or Windows devices, you want to have the tabs that are there. That's what you get when upgrade the design for your Traveler server. But if you're not using that then that wouldn't matter. \n\nAgain, what we would recommend is that you can upgrade your Traveler server to version 9 and then just prevent replication of those design elements to your other servers. Just to make sure that you have everything that you may ever want to use within Traveler available to you. You should be safe in that configuration. \n\nNote: When you upgrade, be sure to upgrade to the latest available versions of both Domino and Notes Traveler. \n * Index of recommended maintenance for IBM Notes Traveler [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24019529] \n * Download Options for Notes & Domino 9.0.1 Fix Packs \n * Interim Fixes for 9.0.1.x IBM Notes, IBM Domino & IBM iNotes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963]\n\n\n\nQ31. Are the devices going to see anything after the upgrades? \nYes, if you have Android users, they're going to be prompted to upgrade their Android client on their devices. But other than that it should be seamless. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nSecurity, SSL, Encryption \n\nQ32. Can someone provide an update what the plans are to have SHA-2 certificate support on Domino for SSL (Microsoft will drop support of older certificates by 31-Dec-2015) ? SPR # ABAI7SASE6 Enhancement Request: Support SHA-2 algorithm for SSL on Domino (High triage priority, but no answer) \nFor SHA2 certificate support, we recommend at this time using an HTTP proxy server to handle the inbound HTTPS requests, Domino 9.x provides IHS with the server that is configured to work with the Domino HTTP web server. \n\n\nQ33. Will Domino support SHA-2? IBM HTTP Server on the front is not ideal. \nNatively there's limited support for SHA-2 - http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/domino_notes/9.0/help9_admin.nsf/855dc7fcfd5fec9a85256b870069c0ab/05c1271fa301b23485257b19005b4d18?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,Encryption,standards [http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/domino_notes/9.0/help9_admin.nsf/855dc7fcfd5fec9a85256b870069c0ab/05c1271fa301b23485257b19005b4d18?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,Encryption,standards] \n\n\nQ34. Domino support told me to get a SHA-1 certificate because SHA-2 wasn't supported. \nSHA-2 is not supported for Domino SSL. SHA-2 pretty much is limited to SMIME message encryption. \n\n\nQ35. What are your plans to resolve wildcard cert setup and import with Domino and related products that run on Domino? It is far too complex a process for 2014, poorly documented, and really a put-off for new customers. \nYou can use wildcard SSL certs on Domino as long as you create the CSR using the Domino server certificate admin database. However, as of today we don't have a supported way to import or export the SSL private key out of a kyr so you wont be able to share the SSL wildcard cert with any non-Domino Web servers. \n\n\nFrom Darren Duke (STS):  * it's convoluted but you *can* convert Domino wild cards for other purposes.... http://blog.darrenduke.net/darren/ddbz.nsf/dx/exporting-domino-ssl-keyfiles-to-another-format-for-use-with-ihs-.htm [http://blog.darrenduke.net/darren/ddbz.nsf/dx/exporting-domino-ssl-keyfiles-to-another-format-for-use-with-ihs-.htm] \n * that blog is actually a \"series\" on getting IHS to work with Domino http://blog.darrenduke.net/Darren/DDBZ.nsf/dx/setting-up-ibm-http-server-to-redirect-all-traffic-to-https-when-fronting-domino-i-guess-this-is-part-3.htm [http://blog.darrenduke.net/Darren/DDBZ.nsf/dx/setting-up-ibm-http-server-to-redirect-all-traffic-to-https-when-fronting-domino-i-guess-this-is-part-3.htm]\n\n\n\nQ36a. One of my clients needs a database that is not user connected, but is still a user. They want to receive encrypted emails into that database. Could I insert the ID file into a mail database and then create an agent that will decrypt these emails and maybe save them again or forward them to a group or whatever. Is that possible?  * So you've got a mail file you want to upload the ID file into the mail file as if you were using it for iNotes, for example. And then you want to have an agent that will decrypt rather than using the standard process of decrypting. There is a LotusScript method that does encrypt that but I would have to look that up really fast. \n * I remember too there's an agent that you could run that could decrypt documents in mass but I think you need to be logged into a Notes client with an ID that would decrypt them. \n\n\nQ36b. That's why I thought that maybe I could upload the ID to the mail database that you could access it and use it, but that's not possible?  * Whoever is the signer and the executor of the agent has to be running with that ID file. I can't even really think how to do that. You would have to detach the ID, switch ID, those are methods and operations we don't have direct access to. \n\n\n * It seems like if it was possible to run an agent based on the public and private keys that are inside of an ID that are in that mail file. If that was possible it seems like that would be a security flaw with encryption enabled. It would be possible to just extract the private key and you would be able to decrypt anything anytime. So to decrypt the document, you need to be logged into either iNotes or Notes using that ID. \n\n\n * 95% of anything related to ID files is not available through the APIs or LotusScript. So there's not much you can do with an ID file. There's only like two or three things that I could think of off the top of my head. We do that for security reasons and legal and liability reasons; makes things more secure that way. \n\n\nQ36c. But is there any way for me to use this anyway. This is a non-user address which is going to receive encrypted emails but maybe a group of five people need to read these emails. Is there any way I can...Can I grant the user to these 5 persons or something?  * What you might want to do. If they need to read the emails, you don't need to decrypt them. You could just put the ID in the mail file and these users could access iNotes and read these emails on the Web. They don't need to be necessarily decrypted. But if the ID is in the mail file, they could log in to iNotes as long as they know the password to get in to the mail file they should be able to read the encrypted emails from the Web. That's the easiest way. \n\n * A more cumbersome way is to just give them each a copy of the ID and they could switch to it from the Notes client when they want to read the email. \n\n\nQ36d. I was hoping they could still keep their own IDs and perhaps access it some way. \nIf it wasn't using mail encryption you could use the ideal of a private encryption key and then distribute that private encryption key to all five users, and then they could use their own ID files. \n\n\nQ37. Are there any plans on group encryption like there is with Exchange? Connected to Active Directory?  * There isn't really anything like that I know of in Notes. Encryption in Notes is a very personal thing, there's no real group encryption. There might be a way to accomplish it but by default, encryption is a personal with the person's public and private key in their own ID is pretty much the only way you could decrypt by default. \n\n * Will mention this to the Security team just to see if they're thinking about it. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting \n\nQ38. I had an issue with the DBMT tool. I implemented it in on three servers in a production environment for a client. When I tried to implement it on a fourth server, it does not start on this server. I can launch it manually and it works fine but I would like to do it on server startup. When I say implement all I really did is made the Program document server start up for DBMT. \nHave you tried putting in a simple fixup or anything? I don't think it's DBMT related. It sounds more program related and maybe an issue with your NAB and the view indexes that the Program documents are using. \n\n\nQ39. Would there be any reason why contact entries would be disappearing from a specific user? Perhaps a good place to start gathering more information? \n * \n * How to analyze questionable deletions in a Notes database\n\n * Get a back up from the day before the document was removed and get the NoteID and then check for a deletion stub in the db that is missing the doc. to confirm they are truly deleted. It might be a good starting point if you need to open a PMR too.\n\n\n * Open a PMR - and ask SWE for sample code to log all future deletions\n\n\n * Yes, questionable deletions are very tough to troubleshoot. My first guess (if there was no replication or sync of any kind) would be something third party. There's nothing by design in Notes that deletes contacts without user action, unless they're recent contacts. \n\n\n * A few possible reasons, there could be deletion stubs for those contacts within his mail file, and he's synchronizing contacts. Or any replication for that matter. They could have been deleted or archived from another database, so the deletion stubs carry over to the local nab but that seems like something that would need to be troubleshot. \n\n\n\nQ40. We have an issue with secondary Domino Directory, indexes are not being updating automatically, so each new user added can't receive emails from outside of company unless we do manually rebuild views in this directory CTRL+Shift+F9 on all SMTP servers. Any documents available on how to setup this automatically?  * Did anyone mess with the View Design settings for Automatic Updating? If not suggest opening PMR with Support \n * Might want to try loading multiple Update tasks in case one is being blocked for an extended period of time\n\n\n\nQ41. I have two SMTP servers that are both ND9 servers. In the past week, one of them seems to get stuck when routing outbound SMTP mail and it gets stuck in the mail.box. The only way they seem to go is if I update the routing tables or start and stop the router. Nothing has changed on the server. Priority is normal. This happens to all kinds of users, not just a few.  * Any difference in third party apps running on the problematic system? Also if you issue a route * does that release some of the mail?\n\n * When you have the issue if you issue a \"Tell Router Show\" what do you see? Also with outgoing mail issue you would want to\n   \n   SET CONFIG CONSOLE_LOG_ENABLED=1\n   SET CONFIG DEBUG_THREADID=1\n   SET CONFIG SMTPCLIENTDEBUG=1\n   \n\n\nQ42. Argh. It would be really really nice if Domino would do something more meaningful than \"Error 500\". It says see such and such log, which I never do any more because it never says more than the console.  * Most of the time when you see 500 server error in the HTTP response, you'll see some more info in the domino server console relating to the error. \n\n * Open up a PMR, we can help you collect htthr thread logs around that error to maybe better understand what's up with your error. \n\n\n\nQ43. We restart Domino each week but the folder IBM Technical Support blows up. Is it a way to clear the files from this folder? Can it be cleared automatically?  * Yes, you have a file retention days within your notes.ini that can reduce that. \n\n * If you want to clean up the IBM tech folder : Open the Server Config Doc --> Diagnostic Tab --> Remove diagnostic files after a specified number of days. Change to Yes and then select the number of days\n\n * \n * Using the IBM_TECHNICAL_SUPPORT directory\n * \n * \n * Console Log is overwritten when size limit is reached\n\n\n * NOTE: \n * \n\n\n * You could also create an IBM Technical Support.dir link and put it off to another drive if you wanted. In theory there's nothing in there that the server needs to run. It's just first time data capture of a lot of information in case you need to capture for a problem report. So periodically, if you're not having any problems and you just want to cleanse that directory, you could do it and it will just start from scratch again when the server starts. Good to have for historical reasons when troubleshooting problems. \n\n\n\nQ44. I'm wondering if there is any way to clean up Console Logs. We have a bunch of old mail files for users and everytime the server loads, you can imagine what happens. Busytime looks for user who doesn't exist and it's just a mess. Cannot find a profile document for every single database. Is that just going to happen or is there a way to fix that?  * That's going to happen as long as those mail files stay in the data directory. It sounds like you've deleted users from the NAB but you haven't deleted their mail files. Is that accurate? \n\n\nWe're required to keep them for records.  * Is there some way to keep them outside of the data directory or do you still need them for active use for the duration of x number of days. \n\n\nThey still need to be there for 2 - 3 years.  * One thing you could do is change the Mail File Owner field to somebody that is still in the system. Because it's basically looking at the Mail File Owner and saying that person's no longer here. If it was changed to someone who was still around we would cease to see those errors at server startup. \n\n * The only problem is if you change the Mail File Owner and mail is received and then an auto-reply message goes out, it's probably going to have that user's name on it (the name of the person listed in the Mail File Owner field). Or if you happen to be running the Out of Office agent, it'll let people know \"this person is no longer with the company, email this person instead.\" There's so many ways around that. \n\n * Another option: Create a generic User ID file and use it in all of them. \n\n\n\nQ45. We've got a small shop here and occasionally one of our users has their Internet password compromised and it results in spam will get a hold of it and use our server. What I have difficulty doing is identifying that compromised account. Is there a way that I could identify more easily SMTP authentication, either current or recent? \n * We have Domino Web Server log that's called Domlog.nsf that shows the logins from users including their IP address. It can identify if you're seeing things coming from IP addresses that don't look correct. Do you have a lot of users who are always traveling coming in from various places and it's hard to identify IP addresses? \n\n\nNo, what's hard to identify is I turn on Verbose logging and I get all of these Web authentication entries in there, but they come in constantly because it always says \"User John Doe found in group cache..\" And then there will be occasional Web authentications and verify passwords. It's difficult to modify that log with all of the SMTP traffic going on and the routing and trying to find trends where you find a common user name that immediately precedes a bunch of SMTP failures. We're running Domino 8.5.3 Fix Pack 6. \n * In 8.5.3 Fix Pack 5 and above, we made a change to the way Auth works so you don't get a dictionary attack. It works the same way as the Internet lockout. But I think what you're saying is their account has already been compromised so they're able to get in and you're trying too figure out how to isolate that, correct? \n\n\nRight. I'm trying to identify the account so I could change the password \n * The biggest thing is that once you've identified the user that has been compromised, you would have to turn on Log Connections, Log Sessions, and SMTP debug with the verbose debugging on so that we could find out that user that has been compromised. \n\n * So if you know the user, then all you would do is turn on Log Connections, Log Sessions, we'll get the IP address and with the SMTP debugging on verbose we would be able to see that it is that user from that IP address, you could block the IP from a firewall but sometimes spammers will change it. \n\n * One of the things that gets harder is if they come through a firewall like a DMZ the authentication will look like it's your DMZ server coming in so you'll have to turn on additional logging to determine who or what IP is making the connection in to you. \n\n\nBut as far as identifying the user the Domlog is the best source? \nThe Domlog will give you the connections that have been made with the Log Sessions, Log Connections and the SMTP debug=4 you would be able then to convert the connection that is being made with the SMTP debugging to see exactly which user it is. \n\n\nQ46. Excel and Lotus Notes/Domino and moving data back and forth. I think everyone is aware with Microsoft's move to the new version of Office, they don't allow .123 files. And so I'm forced to find an old version of Excel. What is a solution, something maybe I don't know so I can quickly move data from Excel into 123, so that I could upload it into Lotus Notes? \n * There should be an Enhancement Request for Excel export/import that may have been realized already. \n * Open a PMR with Support to look in to exactly what you need to get done and we could tell you the best ways to do that. Depending on what you need to do there's probably a couple different things you could use to import that data. \n\n\nI already did and they didn't have anything new that I didn't already know. It was go get a copy of Microsoft 2003 Excel. I was hoping there would be something better even in the Lotus world trying to get a hold of 123 proves to be difficult. \n\nComing out of the IBM client is easy, you save it as .csv.

Can a 8.5.3 client run on ODS level 52 running on Domino 9.0.1?  * Yes, a 8.5.3 client can access a ODS 52 DB as long as it is on the server. If the ODS 52 DB is off the server you will get the invalid ODS. \n\n * You cannot OS file copy that database locally to your 8.5.3 client and attempt to access it locally if you did you would get the Invalid ODS error\n\n * A 9.0.1 client can access an ODS52 database locally\n\n\n\nQ48. So I need to upgrade my clients before I upgrade ODS?  * You can open a ODS 52 Database if it is on the server using an 8.5.3 client. if you wanted to open the ODS 52 db on the local machine you would need 9.0.1 client. \n\n * No only need to if you would be opening an ODS52 database locally on the Notes Client... If the databases are on a remote 9.0.1 server you do not have to upgrade your Notes Client\n\n\n\nQ49. Since upgrading to Notes v9.0 client, we have noticed much slower startup times of the client, typically 5-10 mins, any ideas? \nI would open a ticket. It is almost definitely something provisioning in the background that we'd need more information for. \n\n\nQ50. If I upgrade my server from 8.5.3 to 9.0.1, will it create any trouble for applications running on server? \nShould be just fine. \n\n\nQ51. We have versions Domino 7 and 8 and we're trying to upgrade the 8 versions to 9.0. I'm wondering is there a way to set the compatibility of the applications out within the Web because they are custom. We have hundreds of applications built in the 6 version. Is there a way to certify that they will be working in 7? \n\nI understand that you've got custom Web applications with a variety of different codes behind them that are running just fine on your 7 and 8 servers but you're planning to upgrade to 9. In all of these cases, we don't actually have to certify guarantee that yes, you will never have any problems when you upgrade your servers and then apply your custom applications. \n\nThe short answer is no, we don't have a way to guarantee but we do recommend that you please test your applications. If they are using HTML and JavaScript those are usually pretty good they work pretty well when you upgrade. LotusScript too. I have a piece of LotusScript code that I wrote in 6 and my server is 9 and the code still works. \n\nSo, yes, a lot of times things just work great and there aren't any issues. We just don't have a way to guarantee because we didn't create the code in your custom applications. We can guarantee the code that we create but we can't guarantee the code that somebody else creates. We do support it in the way that we can help you if you do run in to an error we can help you work around that error or suggest how to make that better so that it does work with the new release. I don't anticipate that you should have any major issues but if you do, we could help you with that. \n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\nComments & Suggestions \n\nIf there's additional technical topics you'd love to see future ask the experts / demos please let us know so we can include in our next season of AskTheExperts  * there should be a separate session on business case to \"how and why to fully embrace social: \" - enable activity stream; enable OpenSocial; enable connections 4.5 integration with notes 901 client, etc \n * on the social client request, the webcasts IBM offers do not have concurrent live Q&A and this format is the one admins like us need to see why Social Client might be so useful. \n * idea for an Open Mic - would be on Web services \n * an Open Mic on installing Connections 4.5 on IBM i would be great \n * no shortage of topics on Sametime for ask the experts.

This includes high availability clustering as well as the new multi-instance queue manager feature included with WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1. \n\nCONTENT\nAsk the Experts sessions are conducted in a question and answer format. The table below provides a time index (minutes:seconds) to the recording and describes the questions or topics discussed. You can fast forward to any question using the time index, a table containing the panel of experts is also included.\n\n\nTo play or download the audio of this Ask the Experts session, see the Audio Section of this document.\n\nSee the Related Information Section of this document for a list of documents referenced during the presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the Experts session \n30 March 2011 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT \n\nTime Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 03:47 Technical introduction 04:23 What failover options are available for WebSphere MQ? 05:40 How should I choose between multi-instance queue managers and HA clusters? 08:02 Why was MC91 withdrawn and what replaces it? 10:24 What should I consider when setting up a multi-instance queue manager within a cluster in a mixed MQ version 6 & 7 environment? 14:57 How do you migrate or update MQ in a multi-instance or HA environment? 16:23 If we are looking for to share/run WMQ (HUB) on multiple platforms using the new capabilities added in MQV7 (i.e. MultiInstances), is it necessary to recommend/use an external NFS storage device, in order to meet the customer expectations in terms of HA? And if yes, how do we integrate them? 18:38 What needs to be changed within Windows registry to allow for the proper startup of WMQ Services on a \u201cbackup server\u201d when manually failing over outside the control of something like MSCS? Given a configuration of two servers (A & B) both having WMQ installed and having used the hamvmqm utility to move the qmgr to a \u201ccommon\u201d drive that is only mapped on the \u201cactive\u201d server - what needs to happen on server B within the registry to ensure that WMQ services are start up automatically? 21:30 We are running SUSE 10.3 on a distributed platform. Is SUSE 11.x required to support multi-instance? Also, is it correct to assume that it doesn't work with NSF3 due to the auto-locking capabilities enabled by NFS4? 23:11 I have an iSeries, MQ version 7, multi-instance queue manager wishing to join cluster, where the full repository is mainframe, MQ version 6. The current security policy prevents the use of default port (1414). Our conclusion at the moment is that this isn't possible to configure (making use of the auto switching). Our current plan is to set the cluster receiver channel CONNAME to be the DNS(port) of the system where the queue manager is running. E.g. if the iASP is active on PROD, then I will set the CONNAME of the cluster receiver to \"prod.hsbc.com(99999)\". Then, when the iASP is varied onto the CONT iSeries, we will set the CONNAME to \"cont.hsbc.com(99999)\", & perform a \"refresh cluster\" (we have found that the refresh is required, please advise if you think that this is not the case?). Can you please provide some inputs on the scenario above? 26:33 Is using multiple IP addresses in CONNAME to connect to remote queue manager supported when they aren't configured as multi-instance queue managers? 27:38 Does CONNAME support multiple addresses in WebSphere MQ for z/OS? 28:35 What kind of events causes a client connection switch from an active IP address to another? 29:59 I am running V6 queue managers on HP-UX. HA configuration was done using the MC91 support pack. We use the Veritas (VCS) agent that is provided in MC91. I understand that MC91 is fully embedded in MQ V7 and that it has much more than MC91, but how do I migrate my existing V6 queue managers to V7? Also, optionally, is it possible to continue using the existing configuration of MC91 but still upgrade to V7? 31:08 In the scenario where I create brand new queue managers in V7 \u2013 let us say I create them as multi-instance queue managers using the new flags as documented. My data disk is different than /var. I understand MQ will monitor and offline the queue managers as necessary. In case of failover, how will MQ bring the virtual IP and disk online on the second node? Will it have enough permissions to do that? Or is it necessary to give root authority to the MQM id? 32:51 We are currently migrating from V6 to V7 and one of the issues that came up was relative addressing for XSLT and schemas. We had some misunderstanding about the use of shared storage and working storage. We are concerned about where WebSphere Message Broker in a multi-instance environment will look for the XSLT? 35:50 I have encountered a couple of situations with customers where we have 2 queue managers communicating over standard MCH channels - sender and receive pairs. We are trying to establish a HA capacity between them (this is between one company and an external partner). Is there a way to configure the channels and the transmit queue to allow one queue manager to automatically switch to an alternate queue manager at a different geographic location to continue the message flow if say the partner QM fails? 38:28 I have a question related to slide 35, does the client connection switch only work for both MQ managers, or can the client using a channel definition table, where there are multiple available candidates for connecting to, connect the failing one where it is connected to and switch it to another one on the list from the CCDT. 39:50 In relation to WebSphere Message Broker, if we are using multi-instance and We have services on Oracle databases now, do we lose our resources when we failover to the JDBC resources? 40:54 We are currently running WebSphere MQ V6 on windows. Recently we tried to do a recovery test where we rebuilt the MQ from scratch and re-created it again. We were able to recover all the queue manager objects via script, but one thing that we went into was that in Windows, we discovered that there are some configuration settings which are embedded in the registry itself, such as maxchannel. We have done some research and found that we cannot modify the maxchannel setting via script. My question is are there any tricks or registry settings that we should be concerned about when we perform recovery like this? 42:57 We are running in a Windows environment and I just wanted to know if there is any workaround to making multi-instance queue managers work if we cannot have domain controllers. 44:49 When we use multi-instance queue managers and when they failover from the active instance to the standby instance, how should I let the application know that the queue manager has is running on the standby instance? 47:23 How long does it take for the queue manager to failover from the primary instance to the standby instance, and what factors affect this time? 50:27 Is it possible to use queue managers in an active-active scenario instead of an an active-standby scenario? 53:01 We currently have a single system running on AIX that hosts both the MQ manager and the application together. We want to separate the MQ manager by moving it to a new Linux system and keep the application on the AIX system. What is your recommended way to go about doing this if the goal is to maximize performance? 55:47 I set my Message Broker up to run as a service on MQ, then run it as an MQM user. If I want to run it as an MQSI user, is there any documentation on how to modify the start/stop script to do that? 58:15 I have a question on a multi-instance set up. Let's say we have two queue managers configured as multi-instance, one on machine #1, and the other on machine #2. If we don't want these machines to stay idle all the time, how do we implement a start-up/shutdown script to automatically bring the idle up or to shut it down? 59:52 We are planning to upgrade our MQ from V6 to V7. We are using IBM MC91 agents and are planning to replace them. Are there any special considerations we should be aware of? 62:29 Could you please repeat the options of choosing between when to use HA and Multi-instance? 63:56 Closing remarks 64:27 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Barry Robbins Team Lead, WebSphere MQ Distributed Support Snezhana Johnson WebSphere MQ Distributed Support Tameka Woody WebSphere MQ System i - Windows Support Andrew Schofield Senior Software Engineer, WebSphere MQ Jason Edmeades Service Architect, WebSphere MQ Jonathan Rumsey Lead System i Developer, WebSphere MQ \n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-03302011-AskTheExperts-WebSphereMQFailoverDistributedPlatforms-Robbins.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020934&aid=2] WSTE-03302011-AskTheExperts-WebSphereMQFailoverDistributedPlatforms-Robbins.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020934&aid=1]\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this 64 minutes conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/Mar-30-2011-Robbins.mp3] (7.0MB - audio in MP3 format).

Domino has the option of running the IBM HTTP Server on the same computer as a Domino HTTP server; the purpose of this enhancement is to support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

So there's no need to download or install \nanother version. \n\nNOTE 2: We have found one bug with the installer if you install 9.0 and then you install 9.0.1. We've upgraded IHS but those files will not be copied down. So what you may need to do is to rename the IHS subdirectory under your Domino program directory and then install again selecting the IHS so you get the new binaries. Then copy over your config files as needed. \n\n* * * \nQ1. If you have authorization set up for, let's say, Kerberos or SAML. Does that have any issues when you enable this? \n-- SAML and IHS definitely can coexist. I haven't heard if there has been any issues with SAML and IHS together. \n-- I have set up SAML and IHS at the same time on my development machines and it's worked for me. \n-- I've setup SAML with Web-based authentication. I haven't heard of any there being any issues with Kerberos and IHS. \n\n\nQ2. Regarding TLS over HTTP, is there any talk about integrating that into the Domino HTTP stack? Because now we're adding a layer of complexity of putting IHS in front of Domino and you have limited platforms? \n-- There are SPRs requesting that it be implemented with the HTTP stack and also with other platforms. \n-- It's a fairly large development effort right now so it's still being evaluated. It's not only HTTP that is affected by the SSL stack but rather the entire Domino product that sits atop the same SSL stack. So we have to evaluate the cost of development there. \n\n\nQ3. You eluded to using IHS with the Traveler server. Could you elaborate on what would be the benefits or what would be the reason for doing that with Traveler rather than just the Domino HTTP? \nThere's no extra benefit. The main purpose of this configuration is to support a TLS use-case for the Domino server itself on the same machine. If you do not need that configuration then there is no need for you to configure this. \n\nAlso, in the Notes Traveler case IHS is a 32-bit process so it has a limited number of threads that you can start. I've got up to about 3500 in the lab but after that IHS would probably not start so it may not be suited for some of your Notes Traveler servers. \n\n\nQ4. Is IHS available for platforms besides Windows? Is there any additional feedback about when it might be available for other operating systems? \nIt's under review. No ETA. \n\n\nQ5. What is the difference between the IBM HTTP Server and the Domino HTTP. One difference I noted from your conversation is it's needed for the TLS support in case you want to implement in the Traveler environment. But is there any other benefit or difference between the two? \nThey are very different HTTP servers; one is based on Apache server and one is Domino (homegrown about 15 years ago). So there are different HTTP stacks; the Domino HTTP stack hosts the Domino Web Engine and the Domino application environment where the IHS does not. Those are some of the differences but it's a very large question to answer. \n\n\nQ6. Why couldn't have this been added to the Domino HTTP Engine w/o needing to add IHS? Will Domino support TLS natively in the future without IHS? \nCurrently there are no plans to have Domino support TLS natively. The use of IHS is to allow us to use the TLS security and be able to update it easily going forward. \n\n\nQ7. Did I hear at the beginning that this is for Windows platform only? If so, is that temporary - would like to hear of support for Linux / System P? \nYes, currently this is available only for Windows platforms. It is being investigated for other platforms. The Domino module is currently supported only on Windows for Domino 9 and later. \n\n\nQ8. What is the maximum key size supported for Domino 9? \n-- IKEYMAN will allow you to create key size up to 4096 \n-- Using the Domino server certificate admin database, the largest key we can have using native SSL is 2048 \n\n\nQ9. Can we use WebSphere Edge Server instead of IHS to do the same thing? \nYes, you can use any proxy you like to provide this TLS functionality. IBM provides this IHS offering as an option with your install of Windows Domino 9x. \n\n\nQ10. Any instruction on how to change the existing server from Domino HTTP to IHS? \n-- For an existing 9.0 server the steps are the same - the IHS files can be installed over an existing server install even when that is an existing server. \n-- You can run the Domino installer again and choose the options as mentioned from the Customer Install options. Once installed the configuration is the same. \n\n\nQ11. When running the Domino installer again, will the Domino installer keep all the existing settings when selecting the custom Domino installation? We may have a Domino server with customized installation. \nYes, all your current settings and configurations will be maintained. \n\n\nQ12. IHS is a 32 bit on Windows? \nYes, IHS is 32 bit only \n\n\nQ13. Are there other advantages of using IHS besides TLS support? \nIHS also provides alternate subject name support via IKEYMAN. \n\n\nQ14a. How can I make a redirect from https://serverfqdn>/names.nsf to another page once Domino is behind the IBM HTTP Server? \nThe Domino Web Engine is still in place behind the IHS, so you'd make your Web site rules in Domino just as if you were not using IHS \n\n * Q14b. Except that Domino sees the connection coming in over HTTP. Making a redirection from /names.nsf to ,otherurl> from a website document won't work\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n * Q14c. That's not my experience. I had all rules set up and working. Then we put IHS in front and the rules stopped working.\n * \n * \n\n * Q14d. We haven't tested with Domino 9.0.1 yet. Will do so and if issue still occurs will contact you offline.\n * \n * \n\n\nReferences \nSPR# DMEA96CMVX - fixed in 9.0.1. http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/Public/DC8548ABAF725C9485257C0C0041F3A7?OpenDocument [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/Public/DC8548ABAF725C9485257C0C0041F3A7?OpenDocument] \n\nSPR# MKEN966HFR - fixed in 9.0.1 http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/94db90f3de07606e052569ce00706cdd/ab8e4d745d3202b885257c0c0041f477?OpenDocument [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/94db90f3de07606e052569ce00706cdd/ab8e4d745d3202b885257c0c0041f477?OpenDocument] \n\n\n\n\nFollow highlights from these Open Mics live on Twitter using #ICSOpenMic or following us on Twitter @IBM_ICSsupport.

Use the following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade \nPrerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this interim fix on UNIX systems, set the CANDLEHOME \nenvironment variable to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this interim fix, be sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent to be updated.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" \ncommand, see section [6.2]. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\n> <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/ksa_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar\n\nwhere:\n- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column \nreturned by the ./cinfo -i command. \n\nIn the following example, the file is \n\"ksa_li6263_tema_if0001.tar\".\n> ./cinfo -i\n[Monitoring Agent for Your Product]\n[lx8266 Version: 07.11.01.01] \n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor Windows 32-bit\n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor Windows 64-bit \n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote: if the itmpatch command gets this error:\n\"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side\nconfiguration is incorrect. Please see the application event\nlog for more detail.\" it's necessary install the \"visualstudio\nredistribution package\" before to run the itmpatch command.\n\nFor a 32bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x86.exe, available at\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582]\n\nFor a 64bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x64.exe,available at \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092]\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems \nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more \ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. After \"tacmd addBundles..\" from step 3 above, control files\non the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server must be updated.\nThese updates must be done manually.\n\na. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server update\nThe sa_dd_07110101.xml and sa_dd.properties files must be\ncopied from the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ndirectory to the 071001000 version of the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Services depot.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patchdepot.bat - Windows\nksa_patchdepot.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The\nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\nb. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server update\nResource files must be copied from the\n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory to the\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Portal directory.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patch_resource_teps.bat - Windows\nksa_patch_resource_teps.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The \nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 07110101\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 07110101\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the \nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be \nupdated. The target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command \nis always an OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop. \nNote: If SDA feature is enable at the HUB TEMS, then below steps are\nare not required. SDA will install only browser support and if\ncustomer is using TEP Desktop then install the support manfully\nas shown below.\n\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent support files that must be installed. If you installed these\nupdates, there are no additional installation steps. If you did not\ninstall these updates, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (ksa_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located. \n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one \nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Aquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na 32-bit java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of Tivoli Monitoring components to which \nyou want to add application support. For this fix, check or \nclear the check boxes as follows:\n\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting SAP Agent\n07.11.01.01 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it must\nbe restarted.\n\n7. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote\n(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.\n\n5.5 Installing SAP agent transport\n------------------------------------\nNote: From this fix onwards,a single ITM file has been provided for\nimporting SAP transport on all supported SAP versions having BADI or\nnon-BADI implementation.\n\nThis procedure installs the SAP transport into the SAP system. You\nare not required to uninstall the previous transport before\ninstalling this transport.\n\n1. Go to the ABAP directory in the location where you expanded the\nfix archive file.\n\n2. Copy the transport files into the SAP environment as follows: \n\na. The following two sets of transport files are in the \nABAP directory of the SAP agent fix archive:\n\n1) K711_00103U.ITM and R711_00103U.ITM in /ABAP directory.\nThese files are Unicode versions of the transport. \n\n2) K711_00103_DELETE.ITM and R711_00103_DELETE.ITM\nThese transport files remove the ABAP code. Do not import\nthe DELETE transport unless you stop using the product \nentirely and want to remove the transports from your SAP\nsystems.\n\nb. Copy your transport files to the SAP Transport System data\ndirectory as follows:\n\n1) Copy the K711_00103U.ITM file to the cofiles directory.\n2) Copy the R711_00103U.ITM file to the data directory.\n\n3. Run the following command for non-BADI and BADI where:\nSID Target SAP : system ID\nPROFILE_NAME : Name of the tp profile file\nnnn : Number for the target client where the agent is to run\n\ntp addtobuffer ITMK711_00103U SID\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\ntp import ITMK711_00103U SID client=nnn U16\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\n\n\nAlternately, you can use the SAP STMS transaction to import the\ntransport requests. Ensure that the Import Transport Request Again \nand the Overwrite Objects in Unconfirmed Repairs options are \nchecked on the Import Options tab of the Import Transport Request\nwindow.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If you have not installed the files, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring, Version 6.2.2FP2: Installation and Setup Guide\" \n(ITM6.2.2FP2 Installation and Setup Guide.pdf) under \n\"Installing monitoring agent baroc files on the event server\" in the\n\"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Event Synchronization\" \nsection for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using the itmpatch command\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe itmpatch command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere: \n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification, \nwhere the fix is located. On Windows systems, this path must \ninclude the drive letter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd\ncommand to view the current version of the agent after the agent\nis restarted. You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. The default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory. The default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly,\nuse the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command\non Linux(R) or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the\nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems \nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote:\n- The date of the build displayed might not be accurate. This is\na known problem.\n\nOn Linux systems:\n--------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example: \n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/cinfo -i\n\nNote: cinfo output may differ depending on ITM version.\n\n*********** Fri Dec 5 10:14:10 IST 2014 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel pkcs11\nHost name : IBMSAP1V9 Installer Lvl:06.23.03.00\nCandleHome: /opt/ibm\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nli6243 Version: 07.40.43.00\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nli6263 Version: 06.12.00.00\n\nsa IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP \nApplications\nli6263 Version: 07.11.01.01\n\nue Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n===================================\n\nAbstract: While configuring the agent instance on UNIX, more than 3 \nletters are accepted as instance ID. \nProblem: Three letters are accepted as Instance ID while configuring \nagent instance on UNIX. This can result in failure to connect\nto the SAP system as the \".cfg\" file for that instance will\nbe generated with a wrong name.\nWorkaround:\nThe user should make sure that only three lettered name is \nentered as the instance ID while configuring an agent instance. \n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\n\nABAP Transport Compatibility:\n------------------------------\nEach fix includes an updated agent executable\nprogram (ksaagent or ksaagent.exe) and an updated ABAP transport.\nInstall both programs to obtain the highest level of support.\n\nIn some situations, you cannot install\na new transport immediately because of change control processes on the\nmySAP systems. In these situations, sometimes you can run a new agent\nexecutable with a prior version of the ABAP transport.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What is EQQRETWM and how can it help me manage my batch? \n\nANSWER\nEQQRETWM is a program that has been provided with TWSz for many years. It resides in your SEQQLMD0 load module library. This program can do one and/or two of the following:\n.\n1. Optionally wait a specified amount of time\n2. Optionally abend the job with any abend code, return code, etc.\n.\nYou can see how to use it by looking in your SEQQSAMP sample library, under the member EQQRETWT. Here's a few examples on how to use it:\n.\nWait for 300 seconds, and then end normally (ie. RC=0)\n//STEP010 EXEC PGM=EQQRETWM,PARM=WT300 \nWait for 10 seconds, then abend with a S0C4 abend:\n//STEP010 EXEC PGM=EQQRETWM,PARM='WT10,SA0C4' \nDo not wait, give a return code 16:\n//STEP010 EXEC PGM=EQQRETWM,PARM='RC0016' \n.\nYou can also 'embed' the program EQQRETWM inside other jobs, to abend something:\n.\nFor instance, say you have a job that normally runs and gives a return code 0. If the job returns a step code 2, we can abend the job with a user abend code 222:\n.\n//MYJOB JOB MSGCLASS=X,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),TIME=(1440),REGION=0M \n//STEP001 EXEC PGM=mypgm\n//CHEK001 IF STEP001.RC = 2 then\n//KABOOM EXEC PGM=EQQRETWM,PARM='UA222'\n// ENDIF\n.\nOf course, you can set up the acceptable return codes in TWSz itself, but EQQRETWM allows you multiple return code processing, so it can make your batch a lot more automatic and powerful.",
      "guardium gui ad hoc process box checkbox check tickbox tick email receivers report TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n In the Guardium GUI, the ad-hoc process box prevents me from viewing my reports in some cases. \n\nSYMPTOM\nExample of what the problem looks like on the GUI: \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982064&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nCAUSE\nThere are crashed tables in the internal TURBINE database. There can be many reasons why these tables crashed, one of which being:\n\nRestart of database - If the database restarts during any major process (Guardium related or not), this can leave tables \"open\" or corrupt on database startup.\nDue to this, the process that manages the GUI will not be able to read the necessary information from said tables, causing this issue and possibly others.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nFinding where the issue lies may vary depending on the environment. \n\nStandalone unit - Collect a system_db_info must_gather from this appliance. \n\nManaged unit - The issue may not be on the current appliance. It is possible that the Central Manager has the crashed tables. When the managed unit attempts to gather information necessary for displaying the page in the GUI, this issue may occur. In this case, it is important to get a system_db_info must_gather from both the managed unit and the Central Manager \n\n \n\nOnce the must_gather has been collected\nYou can check on the status of the database in themysql error logwithin it. This log is named differently depending on whether the system is 32 bit or 64 bit.\n- 32 bit error log is named [hostname].err\n- 64 bit error log is named mysql-error.log\n\nThe messages that could indicate a problem are as follows:\n[ERROR]\n[Warning]\nInnoDB: Rolling back trx with id\n\nHere is an example of a crashed table that you could see in this log:\n2016-01-13 08:01:01 4593 [ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Table './TURBINE/TURBINE_USER_GROUP_ROLE' is marked as crashed and should be repaired\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nOnce identifying a potential issue by following the diagnostic steps above, you should provide your findings, along with the system_db_info must_gather to Guardium Support, explaining the issue. \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n IBM MustGather: Collecting data for Guardium Appliance [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469838]\nHow can I troubleshoot a slow Guardium GUI?

Understand that in my case, I have\n   only one company division converting over to SAP and the others\n   are being converted later.  So some of my EDI data needs to go\n   to SAP and the rest continues to go to my legacy system which\n   is JDE.  All of my existing processes use PRCTRNIN, but at some\n   point I will have to replace the calls to PRCTRNIN with calls\n   to SAPIN.  I had to reflag the one acknowledgement that I have\n   received so far for an SAP originated transaction because when\n   it came in it was processed with PRCTRNIN.  No, problem - I\n   reset the status to RN and then invoked SAPIN.  Since it was a\n   997, I did not need to specify an application.  However, SAPIN\n   does not accept *NONE as a value.  Why is that?  I ended up\n   specifying an existing non-SAP app, and of course it wasn't\n   processed because there were no transactions for that app in\n   the comm queue, but I am curious to know why we can't use *NONE\n   for the APPID?\n   Update help :the F1 Help text for the SAP IDOC Structure\n   Version parm\n   Select '4' if you are running a\n   version of SAP that is older than\n   SAP ECC 5.0.\n   \n   Select 'E' if you are running SAP\n   ECC 5.0 or newer.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  run with dummy application id\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  *NONE was not a valid option for the application ID\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  Opened up the application id parameter to include *NONE as a\n   valid option\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IC92561\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   STR GENTRAN ISE\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5725D0901\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   360\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2013-05-23\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2013-08-12\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2013-08-12\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   STR GENTRAN ISE\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5725D0901\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R360 PSY\n   UP",

It sounds like\n   limitation and I'm not sure there is an easy way to solve it. It\n   looks like some design changes should be done in both framework\n   and code generator to solve the issue.\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:vladeruk at 5/27/2015\n   3:30:07 AM =====\n   \n   One more thought: I guess, the problem is related to thread\n   scheduling policy. Probably, if it would be some round robin\n   algorithm or another kind of prioritizing then it could work.\n   But in Windows the thread, which takes control and doesn't call\n   any synchronization API, continues working and doesn't switch to\n   another waiting thread.\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:vladeruk at 5/27/2015\n   3:07:26 AM =====\n   \n   Hi Alex,\n   \n   Application is working according to UML specification. If you\n   need more explanation, please, ask Eldad Palachi, whom I\n   discussed the issue before answering you. He is our main\n   UML/SysML expert.\n   \n   Using of timeout (btw, it can be used with duration=0, which\n   causes only context switching) is not workaround. Original model\n   actually defines endless loop. It is like \"while(true);\"\n   statement is written in C program.\n   \n   Probably, user should change Activity::General::SimulationMode\n   property to use StateOriented semantics. But I'm not familiar\n   with this area .\n   \n   Regards,\n   Vova\n   \n   ===== State: EngineeringComplete by:aaratzlo at 5/27/2015\n   12:26:36 AM =====\n   \n   Thanks so much for the help Vova.\n   \n   The customer, who is an IBMer, does think the implementation\n   still isn't working correctly. Here are is full comments:\n   \n   \"I can see that breaking the loop with a timer will make the\n   model work, however I think that's a bit of a hack. The whole\n   purpose of using threads (Active Concurrency) is to support the\n   type of modelling done in the model. It appears changing the\n   concurrency setting has no effect then? Eldad in development\n   thought that it should :)\n   \n   I think the timer is a workaround, but the implementation\n   doesn't work as expected.\"\n   \n   Any ideas on that?\n   \n   Thanks again!!\n   \n   \n   \n   ===== State: Engineering by:vladeruk at 5/25/2015 11:05:24 AM\n   =====\n   \n   It seems to me it is correct behavior. Since activity diagram\n   contains endless loop, it doesn't switch context from one thread\n   to another one.\n   If you add time event after operation in both activity diagrams\n   (A and B), then active context will switch.

Due to this, SYSID \u2018+++\u2019 was \ndisplayed on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. The function module\nhas been rectified for collecting the data from the SAP \nsystems having versions greater than 46C and SP level \nSPKB46C39.\n\nAPAR: IV60733\nAbstract: MPS CX_SY_CONVERSION_NO_NUMBER IN FUNCTION MODULE\nIBMMON/ITM_FILE_SYSTEM\nAdditional Information: ABAP dump \u2018Conversion Error \u2013unable to \nhandle\u2018---\u2018 as a number \u2019 for the / IBMMON/ITM_FILE_SYSTEM\nfunction module is gracefully handled towards File Systems \nattribute group.\n\n2.2 Defects\n------------\n\nDefect: 58382 \nAbstract: Exception condition \"GWY_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE\" raised.\nAdditional Information: \"GWY_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE\" has been \ngracefully handled for the /IBMMON/ITM_GWY_CONNECTIONS \nfunction module towards the Gateway Connections attribute \ngroup.\n\nDefect: 55733\nAbstract: TEP Remote configuration of SAP Agent is not working on \nnon-windows after remote upgrade.\nAdditional Information: While getting the Config parameters from the\n\".cfg\" file, the two parameters for gateway are removed from \nthe parameters that are being sent to the Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Configuration Panel. Also the \".cfg\" file is updated \nby removing those parameters. Then, reconfiguration of Agent \nInstance with appserver and logon mode through Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal is successful after remote upgradation to\n711FP1 IF1.\n\nDefect: 55366\nAbstract: ABAP Dumps when Job Name is not present in SAP standard\ntable.\nAdditional Information: Exception handling was missing for the\nscenario of the Job Name not being present in the SAP standard\ntable. The issue has been fixed by adding the required \nexception handling for Workspace Integration engine background\njobs when Job is not present in SAP.\n\n\n2.3 Enhancements\n----------------\n\nEnhancement: 67334\nAbstract: Additional functionality to handle the MAI missing Alerts \nin the Function Module /IBMMON/ITM_MAIALRT_INX. \nAdditional Information: Function module /IBMMON/ITM_MAIALRT_INX is \nmodified to fetch the MAI Alerts which are missed by ITM SAP\nAgent as these MAI Alerts are inserted into table \n/IBMMON/ITM_ALIX with some delay by SAP.\nNote: \n1) SAP system time and ITCAM SAP Agent machine time should be\nin sync upto accuracy of seconds.\n2) In order to have full collection of MAI Alerts, there is \nan additional overlap time being added to the sampling time \nfrequency given by the ITCAM SAP Agent.\nThis additional overlap time is configurable parameter on \nthe SAP side\nPlease note -\na)By default the additional overlap time will be 1 min i.e. \n60 seconds. \nb)Maximum additional overlap time which can be configured \nwill be 5 mins i.e. 300 seconds. \nc)If the user wants the additional overlap time greater than\n1 min i.e. 60 seconds and less than or equal to 5mins i.e.\n300 mins, then he should follow the below steps.\n\nPlease find below the steps to configure this additional \noverlap time on SAP side:\n\u2022 Go to transaction code SE16.\n\u2022 Enter the table name as '/IBMMON/ITM_CNFG' and press 'F7'.\n\u2022 Execute the database table '/IBMMON/ITM_CNFG' or press 'F8'.\n\u2022 Add the additional overlap time parameter as \u2018MAI_PERD_OV\u2019\nin the database field 'ITM Configuration Parameters' and \nthen add the additional overlap time in seconds in the \ndatabase field 'VALUE_INT' and save it.\n\n\n2.4 Superseded fixes\n---------------------\n7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-FP0001\n7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\n\n-------------------------\n\n2.5 APARS, Defects and Enhancements included from superseded fixes\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis section contains list of defects fixed / enhancements made in \nprevious releases. To get more details on these changes please refer\nthe README for that particular release.\n\n--------------------------------\n7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-FP0001\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAPAR: IV60177\nAbstract: TEPS DISPLAYS ALERT TIMESTAMP AS UTC \nAdditional Information: MAI Alerts stored in the database table\n'/IBMMON/ITM_ALIX' are in the UTC format.So while fetching \nsuch MAI Alerts, conversion from UTC time zone to current \nsystem time zone is required.\n\nAPAR: IV60254\nAbstract: 'TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE' AND 'R/3 TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE'\nMODULES ARE NOT SENDING DATA FOR HDC \nAdditional Information: Code has been changed in Transaction\nperformance logic which creates 'KSATRANS' file to display\nhistorical data on TEP for Transaction performance.\n\nAPAR: IV60989\nAbstract: EMPTY WORKSPACE FOR BUSINESS PROCESS MONITORING AND\nSYSTEMMONITORING IN TEP\nAdditional Information: Code changes have been done to handle\nexceptions for the SAP standard DSWP_BPM_SOLUTION_ID_CONVERT \nfunction module and for the /IBMMON/ITM_MAIBP_MONITORING \nMAI BPM function module.\n\nAPAR: IV61450\nAbstract: REMOVE PERIOD START/END ATTRIBUTES OF XML MESSAGE LOGS \nAdditional Information: The attributes 'Period Start' and 'Period\nEnd' are used by the agent internally and aren't helpful\nto customer in anyway. In order to hide them from attribute \nview, the 'USAGE' and 'COST' tags have been set to appropriate\nvalues. Also, the queries that define the attribute view have\nbeen modified to remove the 'Period Start' and 'Period End'\nattributes. \n\nAPAR: IV59319\nAbstract: SAP AGENT NOT PICKING UP ALERTS FROM SOLUTION MANAGER \nAdditional Information: This is DOC APAR and the third Party OS \ncommand adapter should be configured and mail notification \nshould be enabled using appropriate steps. \n\nDefect: 53372\nAbstract: Unable to start SAP Agent when candlehome contains \u2018SAP\u2019\nword.\nAdditional Information: Post install script ignores variables\ncontaining 'SAP' keyword and they are not included in 'ksaenv'\nfile. When CANDLEHOME and JAVAHOME contained 'SAP' keyword,\nthey were ignored as well resulting in failure to start \nksaagent.\n\nDefect: 49745\nAbstract: Agent doesn't read syslog.idx file correctly\nAdditional Information: SAP agent read '<SID>_syslog.idx' incorrectly\nleading to corrupt '.idx' file. This resulted in system log not\ngetting detected sometimes.\nNote: This issue is reproducible only with multi instance SAP\nsystem. \n\nDefect: 47233\nAbstract: Test connection utility is not working on windows as\ndesigned for application server mode.\nAdditional Information: With the new NWRFC library, 'Gateway Host' \nand 'Gateway service' are not required while creating a RFC\nconnection with the SAP server. So, these fields have been \nremoved from the agent configuration panel. \n\nDefect: 45898\nAbstract: R/3 action link of \u2018Close Alert\u2019 and \u2018Close Alerts of the\nsame type\u2019 are missing in \u2018Alert Information\u2019 view of CCMS\nmonitoring workspaces.\nAdditional Information: The workspace has been modified to create the\ntwo missing links. Also, the code on the SAP side has been \nfixed to correct the close alert mechanism. \n\nEnhancement: 44620\nAbstract: Netweaver RFC support added for SAP Agent common\nlayers.\nAdditional Information: Netweaver RFC v7.20 support has been added.\nCommunication with SAP system will now happen using the NWRFC\nlibrary instead of the Classic RFC library. \n\nEnhancement: 44663\nAbstract: Logging of SAP 'Component Version Id' and 'Interim Fix Id'\nin the agent log file.\nAdditional Information: SAP 'Component Version Id' and 'Interim Fix\nId' are returned as additional parameters by the \n'/IBMMON/ITM_FUNC_PARMS' function module and can be viewed in\nthe agent logs with minimum trace level enabled.\n\nEnhancement: 45911\nAbstract: Facilitate remote connection of type 'Internal Connection',\n'Connections via ABAP driver' and 'TCP/IP' Connections defined\nin SAP server.\nAdditional Information: This link has been provided from the 'Test\nConnection' link in the 'Connection Monitoring' workspace to \ncheck the status of a remote connection on demand.\n\nEnhancement: 45973\nAbstract: Facilitate single Unicode ITM file containing both BADI and\nnon-BADI objects. \nAdditional Information: Single ITM file has been provided to import\nthe SAP Agent transport on all supported SAP versions having \nBADI or non-BADi implementation.\n\n--------------------------------\n7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\n--------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV53685\nAbstract: TRANSPORT IMPORT FAILS FOR ITM_CONN_CHECK FUNCTION MODULE.\nAdditional Information: 711 GA transport fails with ABAP dump for the\n/IBMMON/ITM_CONN_CHECK function module. Because of this, the \ndata is not collected and displayed on the Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal for some attribute groups, and the dumps are generated \non SAP side.\n\nAPAR: IV52434\nAbstract: ATTRLIB MISSING SLASH IF INSTANCE IS CREATED USING \nADDSYSTEM. \nAdditional Information: Because of the missing slash in ATTRLIB \nfield name, the agent is configured incorrectly that hampers \nthe agent functionality and Historical Data Collection (HDC). \nThis problem occurs when the SAP agent instance is created by \nusing the tacmd Addsystem command, and the same instance is \nreconfigured.\n\nAPAR: IV51184\nAbstract: FUNCTION MODULE \"/IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" GENERATING ABAP \nDUMP.\nAdditional Information: The \"IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" function module is \ninvoked every 10 minutes and it generates ABAP dumps.\n\"/IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" function module was called with \n\"ITM_R3_LOG_RECORD\" parameter. This parameter is not defined. \nThe Syslog information is available from INS and GRP subnodes,\nhowever, problem occurs only while collecting the data for \n:GRP subnode.\n\nAPAR: IV47613\nAbstract: ABAP DUMPS DUE TO OVERFLOW IN /IBMMON/ITM_CCMS_ALERTS \n(ALERT UNIQUE ID). \nAdditional Information: Added a new attribute named \n'Extended Alert Unique Identifier' to hold bigger alert unique \nidentifier. The extended alert unique identifier attribute is \nused to close an alert in the SAP system.\n\nDefect: 43177 \nAbstract: Data is not coming for \u2018ITM_USER_INFORMATION\u2019 for ':Sys' \nnode.\nAdditional Information: The code considered only the 'INS' node.\nTherefore, the user information link in the 'SYS' node did not\nreceive any data. \n\nDefect: 43075 \nAbstract: 'No Applicable data' seen for CCMS Monitoring on ALL Grp \nnode along with 9911 alert in second call of agent in case of \nCEN configured SAP.\nAdditional Information: When retrieving alerts for the first call of\nthe new CCMS design for GRP node in case of Central (CEN) \nsystem, 'No Applicable Data' is displayed on the Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal. The second call of the agent was \ngenerating a 9911 alert.\n\nDefect: 42393 \nAbstract: Argument column in \"Lock Information\" is showing invalid \ndata.\nAdditional Information: Lock argument of locked object shows string \n'[][][][][][][]' on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, when all \npossible fields are responsible for locking that object. \n\nDefect: 42317\nAbstract : Delete transport unable to delete reference of agent BADI\nclass from MAI configured SAP system. \nAdditional Information: BADI delete transport must be able to \ndelete all relevant BADI classes and implementations from the \nsystem where BADI is imported.\n\nDefect: 40637 \nAbstract: Exception condition \"ITM-NOT_FOUND\" raised in case syslog\nrecords are not found at SAP side. \nAdditional Information: If particular syslog details are not present \non the SAP system, then while accessing syslog details using \nsys_detail link on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, a \"Exception \ncondition 'ITM-NOT FOUND' raised\" short dump is generated on \nthe SAP side and a blank screen is displayed on the Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal.\n\nDefect: 39686 \nAbstract: Syslog causing ABAP dump for Group Sub Node. \nAdditional Information: For the logs and traces attribute group of \nthe GRP node, exceptions are raised. \n\nDefect: 39681 \nAbstract: Data is missing for many columns of ITM_JOBS. \nAdditional Information: Data is not displayed for many columns of \nITM_Jobs.\n\nDefect: 39007 \nAbstract: \"No applicable Data\" row should be seen on TEP for system \nlog under system name. \nAdditional Information: If there is no data for the \"System Log\" \nworkspace, then, \"No applicable data\" must be displayed in the \nSystem Name column. \n\nDefect: 38998 \nAbstract: Unable to interpret X as a number in function module\n/IBMMON/ITM_HOSTS. \nAdditional Information: If the SAP system contains more than 9 \napplication servers (RFC servers), the \"Unable to interpret * \nas a number\" message is displayed in the /IBMMON/ITM_HOSTS \nfunction module.\n\nDefect: 38995 \nAbstract: Tivoli SAP agent causing dump in SAP on UNIX server. \nAdditional Information: If an exception occurred while reading job \nlog, the /IBMMON/ITM_JOB_LOG function module is terminated. \n\nDefect: 38903 \nAbstract: IDOC Number not included in the Display item. \nAdditional Information: The \"IDOC Number\" is not available to use \nas a display item in situations. \n\nDefect: 38251 \nAbstract : Data is getting fetched for invalid sub-nodes.\nAdditional Information: Data must be returned only for the sub node \nthat is called; data must not be returned for other irrelevant\nsub nodes. Call from the agent gives ITM_MGROUP or Origin node \nas input to most of the function modules that contain the node \ndetails.\n\nEnhancement: 38724\nAbstract: \"Client\" column is required for ITM_IDOC workspace to \ndifferentiate the respective client's data. \nAdditional Information: Added a \"Client\" column in the \n\"IDOC Information\" view of the \"Data Transfer Information\" \nworkspace. The \u201cClient\u201d column shows the client name for the \nrespective data of client.\n\n\n3.0 Architecture and prerequisites\n===================================\nThis Fix Pack is supported on all operating systems listed in the IBM\nTivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP Applications\nInstallation and Configuration guide, Version 7.1.1 Fix Pack 1:\nLink:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/sap/sap_landing_install.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/sap/sap_landing_install.html]\n\nThe following website contains the latest certification information:\nSoftware Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)\nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html]\n\nYou can also find system requirements for ITCAM for Applications V7.2.1\nFix Pack 1 at:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/prerequisites/apps7211_systemreqs.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/prerequisites/apps7211_systemreqs.html]\n\nITCAM for Applications 7.2.1.1 Knowledge Center:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/welcome_apps7211.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1.1/welcome_apps7211.html]\n\n3.1 Prerequisites for this fix\n------------------------------\nThe prerequisite level for this fix is as follows:\n- IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP\nApplications, Version 7.1.1 Fix Pack 0001\n\n7.1.1 Fix Pack 0001 ISO Part Number:\nPhysical Part Number: ITCAM Agent for SAP Applications CBHU9ML\nElectronic Part Number: ITCAM Agent for SAP Applications CN0MJML \n\nCustomer need to download separately 7.1.1 Fix Pack 0001 GA ISO \nimage from Passport Advantage.\n\n\n- IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.3 FP3 \n\nBecause this fix is cumulative, it can be installed on any fix level\nfor this version, release, and modification level later than the\nprerequisite.\n\n\n4.0 Image directory contents\n=============================\nThis fix image contains the following files:\n- 7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.README - This README file\n- 7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar - Fix archive .tar format\n- 7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.zip - Fix archive .zip format\n\nNote: The .tar and .zip files are identical in content. Use the .tar\nfile if you are working in a UNIX environment; use the .zip file if\nyou are working in a Windows environment.\n\n\n5.0 Installation instructions \n=============================\n\nThis fix can only be installed over an existing installation of\n711 FP0001. Use the following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade \nPrerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this interim fix on UNIX systems, set the CANDLEHOME \nenvironment variable to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this interim fix, be sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent to be updated.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" \ncommand, see section [6.2]. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\n> <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/ksa_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar\n\nwhere:\n- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column \nreturned by the ./cinfo -i command. \n\nIn the following example, the file is \n\"ksa_li6263_tema_if0001.tar\".\n> ./cinfo -i\n[Monitoring Agent for Your Product]\n[lx8266 Version: 07.11.01.01] \n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor Windows 32-bit\n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor Windows 64-bit \n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote: if the itmpatch command gets this error:\n\"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side\nconfiguration is incorrect. Please see the application event\nlog for more detail.\" it's necessary install the \"visualstudio\nredistribution package\" before to run the itmpatch command.\n\nFor a 32bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x86.exe, available at\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582]\n\nFor a 64bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x64.exe,available at \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092]\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems \nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more \ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. After \"tacmd addBundles..\" from step 3 above, control files\non the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server must be updated.\nThese updates must be done manually.\n\na. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server update\nThe sa_dd_07110101.xml and sa_dd.properties files must be\ncopied from the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ndirectory to the 071001000 version of the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Services depot.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patchdepot.bat - Windows\nksa_patchdepot.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The\nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\nb. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server update\nResource files must be copied from the\n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory to the\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Portal directory.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patch_resource_teps.bat - Windows\nksa_patch_resource_teps.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The \nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 07110101\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 07110101\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the \nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be \nupdated. The target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command \nis always an OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop. \nNote: If SDA feature is enable at the HUB TEMS, then below steps are\nare not required. SDA will install only browser support and if\ncustomer is using TEP Desktop then install the support manfully\nas shown below.\n\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent support files that must be installed. If you installed these\nupdates, there are no additional installation steps. If you did not\ninstall these updates, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (ksa_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located. \n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one \nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Aquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na 32-bit java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of Tivoli Monitoring components to which \nyou want to add application support. For this fix, check or \nclear the check boxes as follows:\n\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting SAP Agent\n07.11.01.01 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it must\nbe restarted.\n\n7. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote\n(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.\n\n5.5 Installing SAP agent transport\n------------------------------------\nNote: From this fix onwards,a single ITM file has been provided for\nimporting SAP transport on all supported SAP versions having BADI or\nnon-BADI implementation.\n\nThis procedure installs the SAP transport into the SAP system. You\nare not required to uninstall the previous transport before\ninstalling this transport.\n\n1. Go to the ABAP directory in the location where you expanded the\nfix archive file.\n\n2. Copy the transport files into the SAP environment as follows: \n\na. The following two sets of transport files are in the \nABAP directory of the SAP agent fix archive:\n\n1) K711_00103U.ITM and R711_00103U.ITM in /ABAP directory.\nThese files are Unicode versions of the transport. \n\n2) K711_00103_DELETE.ITM and R711_00103_DELETE.ITM\nThese transport files remove the ABAP code. Do not import\nthe DELETE transport unless you stop using the product \nentirely and want to remove the transports from your SAP\nsystems.\n\nb. Copy your transport files to the SAP Transport System data\ndirectory as follows:\n\n1) Copy the K711_00103U.ITM file to the cofiles directory.\n2) Copy the R711_00103U.ITM file to the data directory.\n\n3. Run the following command for non-BADI and BADI where:\nSID Target SAP : system ID\nPROFILE_NAME : Name of the tp profile file\nnnn : Number for the target client where the agent is to run\n\ntp addtobuffer ITMK711_00103U SID\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\ntp import ITMK711_00103U SID client=nnn U16\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\n\n\nAlternately, you can use the SAP STMS transaction to import the\ntransport requests. Ensure that the Import Transport Request Again \nand the Overwrite Objects in Unconfirmed Repairs options are \nchecked on the Import Options tab of the Import Transport Request\nwindow.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If you have not installed the files, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring, Version 6.2.2FP2: Installation and Setup Guide\" \n(ITM6.2.2FP2 Installation and Setup Guide.pdf) under \n\"Installing monitoring agent baroc files on the event server\" in the\n\"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Event Synchronization\" \nsection for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using the itmpatch command\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe itmpatch command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere: \n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification, \nwhere the fix is located. On Windows systems, this path must \ninclude the drive letter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd\ncommand to view the current version of the agent after the agent\nis restarted. You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. The default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory. The default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly,\nuse the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command\non Linux(R) or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the\nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems \nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote:\n- The date of the build displayed might not be accurate. This is\na known problem.\n\nOn Linux systems:\n--------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example: \n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/cinfo -i\n\nNote: cinfo output may differ depending on ITM version.\n\n*********** Fri Dec 5 10:14:10 IST 2014 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel pkcs11\nHost name : IBMSAP1V9 Installer Lvl:06.23.03.00\nCandleHome: /opt/ibm\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nli6243 Version: 07.40.43.00\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nli6263 Version: 06.12.00.00\n\nsa IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP \nApplications\nli6263 Version: 07.11.01.01\n\nue Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n===================================\n\nAbstract: While configuring the agent instance on UNIX, more than 3 \nletters are accepted as instance ID. \nProblem: Three letters are accepted as Instance ID while configuring \nagent instance on UNIX.

In these situations, sometimes you can run a new agent\nexecutable with a prior version of the ABAP transport. This section \nexplains when it is possible to run a newer agent executable program\nwith an older version of an ABAP transport.\n\nNote: The mySAP agent does not run correctly if not installed with\na compatible level of the transport.\n\nFix Level Delivered Transport Minimum Transport Level\n----------- ------------------- -----------------------\nFP0001-IF0001 ITMK711_00103U ITMK710_00103U\nFP0001 ITMK711_00100U ITMK711_00100U\nIF0001 ITMK711_00099U ITMK711_00098U\n711 GA ITMK711_00098U ITMK711_00098U\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information:\n================================== \nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml.\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

The error can occur on the MQ server or also a MQ client application..\n\nAMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed\n\nRemote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '???'.\n\nEXPLANATION: WebSphere MQ failed to determine the revocation status of the remote SSL\ncertificate for one of the following reasons:\n\n(a) The channel was unable to contact any of the CRL servers or OCSP responders for the certificate.\n(b) None of the OCSP responders contacted knows the revocation status of the certificate.\n(c) An OCSP response was received, but the digital signature of the response could not be verified.",
    "gold_doc": [
      "AMQ9716 7.0.1.0 SSL OCSP SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n You upgrade to WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0 (or later) and have SSL enabled channels. After the upgrade you notice that in the Queue Manager error LOGs you see the following error message:\n\nAMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '????'. \nThe channel does not start. \n\nSYMPTOM\nError AMQ9716\n\n\nCAUSE\nWith the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. \n\n\nThis was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe best thing to do in this case is to determine the cause of the UNKNOWN return code and fix it. \n\n\nThere are two possible methods to discover which OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess URL is embedded in a certificate. \n\nMethod 1.\nPlace the certificate on a Windows machine; ensure to use a file extension of \"crt\" and double-click it. View the detail extensions for the AIA. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=1]\n\nMethod 2\nUse IBM Key Management (gskit) GUI to view them. Issue the following command::\nIn Windows: strmqikm \nIn UNIX: gsk7ikm (MQ V7) or runmqckm (MQ V8)\n\nFrom the IBM Key Management window:\nSelect View/Edit for certificate\nView Details\nExtensions\nAuthorityInfoAccess\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=2]\n\nThe first step would be to insure that connection to the URL in your certificate can be reached.\n\n\nWork-around:\nUse this only as a temporary fix until the root cause can be found.\nYou can do the following. It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start. If UNKNOWN is returned it will not stop the channel from starting and the AMQ9716 will not be reported.\n\nUNIX and Linux systems add the following to qm.ini\nSSL:\nOCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nTo set for a Windows Queue Manager, run the following command:\namqmdain reg YourQMgrName -c add -s SSL -v OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nThe OCSPAuthentication setting is also applicable to clients and can also be set in the client ini file (e.g. mqclient.ini). Changes to the client OCSPAuthentication setting will take effect after the application is restarted.\n\nOn a queue manager, users will need to issue a REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(SSL) command (or the GUI/PCF equivalent) in order for the change in SSL settings to take effect.\n\nOCSP provides your SSL channels with additional security. Once the cause of the AMQ9716 error has been addressed then you are strongly recommended to re-enable OCSP enforcement\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n OCSP Info [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/sy13000_.htm?lang=en]\n\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ"

Because the CLNTCONN definition supplied\n   by the program did not include any certificate revocation\n   information, the WebSphere MQ code tried to load the Client\n   Channel Definition Table (CCDT) file to check for that\n   information.

SSL message channels remain in BINDING status with a\n   substate of SSLHANDSHK. SSL client applications experience a\n   hang in the MQ connect call.\n   \n   A core dump or debugger output of the delay shows a thread stack\n   similar to the following:\n   \n   #1  0x408682c8 in connect () from /lib/libpthread.so.0\n   #2  0x41b9e189 in GSKHTTPChannel::OpenChannel_real () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   #3  0x41b9df64 in GSKHTTPChannel::OpenChannel () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   #4  0x41b9dbf4 in GSKHTTPChannel::open () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   #5  0x41b9f9eb in GSKHttpClient::openChannel () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   #6  0x41b9fc58 in GSKHttpClient::reconnectIfNeeded () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   #7  0x41bd5694 in GSKOcspClient::getHttpResponse () from\n   /usr/lib/libgsk7cms.so\n   \n   The exact appearance of the stack may vary between platforms,\n   however the key symptom is a connect() call issued from within\n   GSKOcspClient::getHttpResponse(), inside the\n   gsk_secure_soc_init() function.\n   \n   In most cases, the channel times out and the delay ends after\n   several minutes. What happens next depends upon the MQ\n   OCSPAuthentication configuration setting.\n   \n   When using the default OCSPAuthentication REQUIRED setting, the\n   channel will fail and error AMQ9716 is logged. In the case of\n   client application, reason code MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR\n   (2393) is returned by the MQ connect call. In the case of a\n   message channel, the channel enters the RETRYING state.\n   \n   When OCSPAuthentication is set to WARN then a warning message\n   AMQ9717 is logged and the channel will start. Both message\n   channels and client applications will then function normally\n   from this point onwards.\n   \n   When OCSPAuthentication is set to OPTIONAL then the channel will\n   start. Both message channels and client applications will then\n   function normally from this point onwards.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  The environment variable AMQ_SSL_OCSP_NO_CHECK_AIA can be set.\n   export AMQ_SSL_OCSP_NO_CHECK_AIA=1\n   This should be done in the shell that the QMgr is started in.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   USERS AFFECTED:\n   Users of WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0 SSL channels whose digital\n   certificates contain the AuthorityInfoAccess certificate\n   extension and whose MQ systems cannot connect to the OCSP\n   responder URL in the AuthorityInfoAccess certificate extension.\n   The issue can affect both SSL message channels and SSL client\n   applications.\n   \n   Platforms affected:\n   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)\n   ****************************************************************\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\n   Some digital certificates used for SSL/TLS channels contain a\n   certificate extension known as AuthorityInfoAccess (or AIA).\n   This certificate extension specifies the location of an OCSP\n   responder server which can be queried to discover if the\n   certificate is revoked.\n   \n   In WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0, AuthorityInfoAccess certificate\n   extensions are checked by default in order to provide enhanced\n   protection against the use of revoked digital certificates.\n   Users whose existing digital certificates already contained\n   AuthorityInfoAccess extensions might experience SSL connectivity\n   delays if the OCSP responder server is not reachable from within\n   their network.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  Users are strongly recommended to enable connectivity to the\n   OCSP responder server identified in their digital certificates\n   so that they can gain the security benefits of the additional\n   revocation checking.

Digital certificates\n   periodically expire and must be replaced, so expiry time would\n   be suitable to remove any unwanted AuthorityInfoAccess\n   extensions.\n   \n   For cases where an immediate work-around is required to suppress\n   the OCSP check, this APAR introduces a new ini file setting.\n   Users can add the following setting to their SSL stanza:\n     OCSPCheckExtensions=no\n   \n   This can be set in the client ini file (for example,\n   mqclient.ini) or in the queue manager configuration (for\n   example, qm.ini or the Windows registry equivalent).\n   \n   With this setting in place then WebSphere MQ will ignore\n   AuthorityInfoAccess certificate extensions and will not attempt\n   the OCSP check.\n   \n   On a queue manager it is necessary to issue a REFRESH SECURITY\n   TYPE(SSL) MQSC command (or the equivalent MQCMD_REFRESH_SECURITY\n   PCF command) before the new setting will take effect.\n   \n   On a client it is necessary for the client application either to\n   restart or to close all of its SSL connections before the new\n   setting will take effect.\n   \n   The WebSphere MQ documentation will be updated to describe the\n   new setting. In particular, topic cs13400 will be updated. Also\n   topics sy13000 and e_auth_info_ocsp will specify that\n   AuthorityInfoAccess extensions are not checked if\n   OCSPCheckExtensions=no in the SSL stanza.\n   \n   Users who have set the OCSPCheckExtensions setting must remove\n   the setting before removing the APAR fix. Also, users who revert\n   to WebSphere MQ fixpack 7.0.1.0 or earlier must remove the\n   OCSPCheckExtensions setting before removing the fixpack.\n   \n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-Windows-RP0001        |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-SolarisX64-RP0001     |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-SolarisSparc64-RP0001 |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-LinuxX64-RP0001       |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-LinuxS390X-RP0001     |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-LinuxPPC64-RP0001     |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-LinuxIA32-RP0001      |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-HpuxPaRISC64-RP0001   |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-HpuxIA64-RP0001       |\n   | MDVREGR 7.0-WS-MQ-AixPPC64-RP0001       |\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\n   \n                      v7.0\n   Platform           Fix Pack 7.0.1.1\n   --------           --------------------\n   Windows            U200310\n   AIX                U827232\n   HP-UX (PA-RISC)    U826485\n   HP-UX (Itanium)    U826884\n   Solaris (SPARC)    U827125\n   Solaris (x86-64)   U827374\n   iSeries            tbc_p700_0_1_1\n   Linux (x86)        U826321\n   Linux (x86-64)     U827231\n   Linux (zSeries)    U827105\n   Linux (Power)      U826779\n   \n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\n   'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\n   \n   If the maintenance level is not yet available, information on\n   its planned availability can be found in 'WebSphere MQ\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IZ64036\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ SOL SPARC\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7223\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   701\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2009-10-29\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2009-11-11\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2010-04-08\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ SOL SPARC\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7223\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R701 PSY\n   UP",
      "configuring certificate revocation PRODUCT LIFECYCLE\n\nABSTRACT\n This document describes how to configure the Tivoli Directory Server Version 6.3 fix pack 10 (6.3.0.10) Web Administration Tool with WebSphere Application Server v7.0.0.19 or v8.0.0.0 to support certificate revocation using OCSP. \n\nCONTENT\nIntroduction: \n\nWhen using certificates, it is important to validate the certificates to determine whether the certificates are acceptable and meet the security requirements for which they were implemented. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that is used to obtain information about the certificate revocation status. An online check against the OCSP server is performed to determine if the certificate exchanged during an SSL communication is revoked.\n\nTo implement certificate revocation, a user can choose a mechanism such as OCSP or Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Using OCSP, users can obtain information about the revocation status of a certificate at any time. When a user attempts to access a server, OCSP sends a request to obtain certificate status information and the server sends a response of current, expired, or unknown to the client. The protocol specifies the syntax for communication between the servers, which contains the certificate status; and the client application, which requires status information. OCSP provides a grace period for users with expired certificates so that they can access the server for a limited time before renewing the certificates.\n\nSome of the limitations of using CRL that can be overcome by using OCSP: \n\n * If the updates to CRL list are frequent, then the list must be downloaded frequently to keep the list updated at the client end. \n * If the data size of the CRL list is large, then getting frequent updates can be time-consuming.\n\n\nThe benefits of using OCSP for certificate revocation are as follows:  * Provides instant revocation \n * Useful for high-value fund transactions \n * Adds an addition layer to highly secure environment\n\n\nSome of the limitations of OCSP that a user must consider before implementing OCSP for certificate revocation are:  * In OCSP, no claims regarding the validity of certificates other than the revocation status is made. \n * OCSP does not verify whether a certificate is within its validity period, or the certificate is used in the context it is meant for. \n * It is difficult to implement certificate revocation by using OCSP that can offer a near-zero latency revocation information.\n\n\nThis document describes the configuration details required to verify the certificate revocation status of SSL certificates by using OCSP. In this scenario, the Web Administration Tool is deployed on an OCSP-enabled WebSphere\u00ae Application Server. \n\nNote: Installation and configuration of OCSP responder is out-of-scope of this document. User must refer the OCSP product documentation for installation and configuration of OCSP responder. \n\nRequired software: \nThe minimum version of software required to configure the Web Administration Tool to support certificate revocation by using OCSP are as follows:  * IBM Tivoli Directory Server version 6.3 fix pack 10 (6.3.0.10) \n * IBM WebSphere Application Server version 7.0.0.19 or WebSphere Application Server version 8.0.0.0\n   Note: Use of WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment and embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) are not supported as these do not provide OCSP support. \n * IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) 8.0.14.14 (the minimum required version is GSKit 8.0.14.11)\n\n\nUse case scenario for checking certificates: \nThe steps involved in verifying of certificate revocation status during an SSL communication using OCSP is as follows: \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21578272&amp;aid=1] \n 1. Using a browser, connect to the Web Administration Tool set for client and server authentication over SSL . When the connection request is initiated between the browser and the Web Administration Tool over SSL, the Web Administration Tool sends its server certificate to the browser. The browser performs a path validation check on the certificate and based on the validation result the browser either trusts the WebSphere Application Server certificate or otherwise. If the server certificate is valid, the browser continues to establish the SSL session with the Web Administration Tool. Next, the Web Administration Tool requests the browser to send client certificate to authenticate itself. \n 2. On receiving the client certificate, WebSphere Application Server runs a path validation check on the client certificate. It then sends an OCSP request to the relevant OCSP responder requesting for the client certificate status. \n 3. The OCSP responder checks the validity of the client certificate and returns the status in its OCSP response. Based on the status, the WebSphere Application Server either trusts the client certificate or distrusts the client certificate. \n 4. If it is trustworthy, then WebSphere Application Server continues with establishing the SSL connection.\n\n\nSetup overview: \nOverview of the steps to set up certificate revocation using OCSP is as follows:  1.  Install Tivoli Directory Server version 6.3 fix pack 10 (6.3.0.10). \n 2.  Generate the server key (kdb file), and client key (jks file). Then, interchange the CA certificates of the keys to recognize each others certificates. \n 3.  Create and configure directory server instance to communicate over SSL. \n 4.  Restart the directory server and administration server. \n 5.  Install WebSphere Application Server. \n 6.  Deploy the Web Administration Tool into WebSphere Application Server. \n 7.  Configure the Web Administration Tool to communicate over SSL. \n 8.  Restart the Web application server associated with the Web Administration Tool. \n 9.  Configure the directory server to communicate over SSL only. \n 10. Restart the directory server and administration server.\n\n\n\nProcedure:  * Installing and configuring Tivoli Directory Server:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * idsadduser\n * \n *  # idsadduser -u myinst1 -w <userPWD> -l /home/myinst1 -g idsldap \n * \n * a. To create a directory server instance, run the idsicrt command. For example:  * # idsicrt -I myinst1 -e <seed4instance> -l /home/myinst1\n   \n   b. To configure database for the newly created directory server instance, run the idscfgdb command.

With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. \n\n\nThis was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA.

This error almost always means that the policy did not receive any data. If you increase the logging from error to debug, you should see network failures surrounding the response header error.\n\n\n\nIn almost every event, this error is caused by a connection failure.\nThe error is correct, the service did not receive any response headers or data. The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug. This will allow you to see the network debug errors around the context of the service error.\n\n\nANSWER\nThe classic causes of this are either of these two: \n\n\n\n \n\nA slow response that causes the connection to timeout before receiving the response\nA failed connection attempt due to a closed persistent connection or some other connection issue that prevents the WebSphere\u00ae DataPower device\u00ae from connecting to the backend. For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower\u00ae.\nAn example of this is explained here:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]\n\nThere are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections. If this does not prevent the problem, then analysis of the packet trace and error report are required."

The actual connections from the device to the database server have no user-configurable timeouts.  \n\nMQ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe MQ protocol will use the following options for response timeout. \n\n * \n * Note:\n *  The url-open() and Results Action have the same timeout behavior. The var://service/routing-url and Static Backend URL have the same timeout behavior.\n   \n\nTimeout Behavior Response When the Timeout option is set on the url string, it will take precedence over the User Agent Timeout even if the User Agent is set to a lower Timeout value. The User Agent Timeout will be used if no Timeout option is set. Persistent Also known as the connection reuse timeout. This timeout is determined by the Cache Timeout value in the MQ Queue Manager. \nLog Target \n\n\n\n\n\nLog target connections have no timeout options for the TCP-based methods such as SOAP and Syslog-ng.

Not using persistent\n   connections comes with a performance penalty, but it very much\n   depends on the size/type of the transferred data and the\n   speed/ping of the network.\n   \n   SLM is also strongly encouraged to prevent the backend from\n   getting more load than it can handle.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  Affected are all customers using the Multi-Protocol Gateway,\n   Web Service Proxy or Web Application Firewall with persistent\n   connection to the backend side.\n   \n   In case the backend server stops responding to HTTP GET\n   requests while there are already some established TCP\n   connections from the time the server worked OK, DataPower will\n   automatically retry those GET requests after a timeout period.\n   This will be retried until there are no established connections\n   to the server.\n   \n   During a high load window, these unwanted retries might\n   eventually keep flooding an already congested backend,\n   especially if it is still able to establish some new\n   connections.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.16, 6.0.1.12, 7.0.0.9, 7.1.0.6 and\n   7.2.0.2.\n   \n   For a list of the latest fix packs available, please see:\n   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631]\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IT08971\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   DATAPOWER\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   DP1234567\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   600\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2015-05-18\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2015-08-12\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2015-09-02\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   DATAPOWER\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   DP1234567\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R600 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R601 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R602 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R700 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R710 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R720 PSN\n   UP",

I am asking this question because it allows the backend team to replace the backend server with DR site when the backend server crashes.I know that DataPower DNS cache depends upon TTL value in present when it queries DNS server to resolve the IP address. Will this hold good for this?\n\n29:03 What is the difference between configuring duration monitor filters and SLM monitors? 30:17 Why doesn't SLM monitor express threshold in milliseconds? 31:00 Why does the dp:get-cert-details extension function depend only on objects or a base64 string? Why can't it read cert files for details? Are there plans to enhance this function? 32:29 Why does the CPU and memory usage of the device suddenly rise even when there is no significant increase in message flow ? (for example: traffic flow amongst two devices is equivalent, but one device is peaking at 45 % cpu and 50 % mem, while the other device is at 2 - 3% cpu and 5 - 10 % mem usage). The configuration on both the devices is completely identical. 36:17 What is the key? Is it the public certificate, thumbprint, serial number or any other part? 37:02 Can the panel of experts advise on the use case for Multi protocol gateway? 38:55 if we expose IMPG multi protocol gateway as a service and if we don't have a wsdl, will the HTTP client consume that multi protocol gateway service? 41:18 Can the same XSL stylesheets be used for hooking up WS-proxy and XML-fw to ITCAM for SOA? 43:00 Let's say we have a set of certificate loaded on the DataPower device, and we would like to interrogate each certificate using the dp:get-cert-details extension function in order to get some details about the DN, CN and expiration date. Right now we are creating object for every single certificate, can we avoid redundancy if we have the function go directly to the certificate file? 47:53 Does DataPower support FTPS, or is it only SFTP enabled? 48:33 Can DataPower rotate keys? 49:05 Is the functionality of ITCAM for SOA provided in WAMC? 53:54 You had mentioned that the SLM monitor will allow time limits to be set in milliseconds, but I am unable to do because it only allows me to set time limits in seconds. With this limitation in mind, I am trying to set up a SLM monitor for calculating the total latency of a given WebSphere proxy, and to have it notify me with an e-mail whenever the latency crosses the threshold level of maybe 500 milliseconds. I currently accomplish this with the duration monitor with a filter on it. However, I observe that with the threshold filter on the duration monitor I do not get notified every time the event occurs. Instead I observe that I get notified onlyon every alternate occurrence. Why does this behavior exist? 57:50 Is there possibility to do some state management for transactions in DataPower? (i.e. saving state for correlations between multiple different transactions coming to the box) 58:55 Closing remarks 59:43 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Dominic Micale DataPower L2 Support Engineer Alfred Williamson DataPower L2 Support Engineer Dorine Yelton DataPower L2 Support Engineer Chin Sahoo DataPower L2 Support Engineer Moses Allotey-Pappoe DataPower L2 Support Engineer Paul Megani DataPower L2 Support Engineer \n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-06302011-AskTheExperts-KeyFunctionsWebSphereDataPowerSOAAppliances-Megani.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021649&aid=2] WSTE-06302011-AskTheExperts-KeyFunctionsWebSphereDataPowerSOAAppliances-Megani.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021649&aid=1]\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this 59 minutes conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/Jun-30-2011-Megani.mp3] (7.0MB - audio in MP3 format).

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I troubleshoot DataPower SOA Appliances connectivity issues with backend servers? \n\nANSWER\nWhen troubleshooting an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance to determine why it is not able to connect or is having intermittent connection failure with the backend, the listed firmware provides a few CLI and WebGUI commands to help in the debug process. \n\nBelow are some of the common troubleshooting examples. These examples are using an XS40; however, the commands are valid for all models of DataPower SOA Appliances.\n\n\n 1. \n 2. Start with ping from CLI  * xs40(config)# ping backenddb.domain.com\n     * \n     * xs40(config)# ping 10.1.0.121\n    \n    \n    In the above example, you can first ping by hostname and then by IP address. This helps determine if your device is able to resolve the name if entered. If ping by name fails but IP works, you may need to check DNS settings or routing to DNS server(s).\n    \n    If ping for both IP and name fails, ping the default gateway to ensure you can reach the gateway:\n     * xs40(config)# ping 10.1.0.1 \n     * \n    \n    \n    If this action fails, check the cables, netmask or possible the ethernet port.\n    \n    \n 3. Test connection on a service port. \n    This is useful when you can ping the IP but the connection still fails. Below is CLI command example:\n     * xs40(config)# test tcp-connection 10.1.0.121 389\n    \n    \n    In the above example, we are trying to reach an LDAP port. If the command does NOT return a \"TCP connection successful\" message, it's likely that either LDAP is not running, running on a port other than 389, or a network/system firewall is blocking traffic on port 389.\n    \n    \n 4. Confirm the best route. You may find delayed response from the client or backend, intermittent network failure etc. It is possible the device has a conflicting routing configuration. The traceroute command shows how the routing is being determined.\n     * xs40(config)# show route \n     * \n     * xs40(config)# traceroute 10.1.0.121\n    \n    \n    Observe the \"rtt\" value and the routers/gateway. A network administrator should be consulted if any issue is found in the result. Also, see Configuring Default Gateway on DataPower device [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21320815] to avoid conflicting routing conflicts. \n    \n    \n 5. Depending on the nature of the behavior, if it looks like a packet trace will be needed to help diagnose the problem, disable the:\n    Network>Network settings> TCP Segmentation off-load \n    feature on the device. Then see if the problem remains and collect the packet trace.\n    \n    If the network problem is still unresolved, more advanced troubleshooting like Packet Capture can be helpful.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What is SSL session caching of DataPower? What is the meaning of Server-side Session Caching, Server-side Session Timeout and Server-side Session Cache Size? Will it affect SSL renegotiation? \n\nANSWER\nThere are three SSL session caching-related options in SSL proxy profile: \n\n * Server-side Session Caching \n * Server-side Session Timeout \n * Server-side Session Cache Size\n\nEvery SSL handshake generates an \"SSL session id\". When Server-side Session Caching is enabled, the initial ssl session id will be cached. Then, the next time that same client connects, the server will check to see if  * There is an existing SSL Session ID for that client \n * That session ID is cached and still valid.\n\nIf these are confirmed, an abridged or short SSL handshake will be used to improve performance. \n\nThe Server-side session timeout defines the timeout in seconds for each entry in the server-side session cache. The Server-side Session Cache Size defines the entry size of session cache. \nTo clarify the SSL Renegotiation behavior by version, see How do I enable insecure SSL Renegotiation in an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Service. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432579] \n\nWhen the SSL negotiation happens, the client and server will renegotiate ciphers, encryption/decryption keys, etc. A new entry will be created in the SSL session cache and the cached session will become invalid even though the entry is not timedout.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances General Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.1, 3.8, 3.7.3, 3.7.2, 3.7.1",

This error almost always means that the policy did not receive any data. If you increase the logging from error to debug, you should see network failures surrounding the response header error.\n\n\n\nIn almost every event, this error is caused by a connection failure.\nThe error is correct, the service did not receive any response headers or data. The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug. This will allow you to see the network debug errors around the context of the service error.\n\n\nANSWER\nThe classic causes of this are either of these two: \n\n\n\n \n\nA slow response that causes the connection to timeout before receiving the response\nA failed connection attempt due to a closed persistent connection or some other connection issue that prevents the WebSphere\u00ae DataPower device\u00ae from connecting to the backend. For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower\u00ae.\nAn example of this is explained here:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]\n\nThere are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections. If this does not prevent the problem, then analysis of the packet trace and error report are required."

The User Agent Timeout will be used if no Timeout option is set. Persistent Also known as the connection reuse timeout. This timeout is determined by the Cache Timeout value in the MQ Queue Manager. \nLog Target \n\n\n\n\n\nLog target connections have no timeout options for the TCP-based methods such as SOAP and Syslog-ng.

For example the DataPower Back Persistent timeout is at the default value of 180 seconds and the WAS HTTP transport is set to 120 seconds. This will open the opportunity for WAS to close what DataPower believes to be an open reusable connection.\nThis is also described in technote http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934]\n\n2) The other possible source of this error is when the WAS HTTP transport option \"Maximum persistent requests per connection\" is configured. This again allows for the server side of the connection to close a connection when the client, DataPower, believes the connection is reusable.\n\nThe client side of the connection should be in controll of the reuse and timeout to prevent these type of failures.\n\nIf these two are eliminated and the problem persists then a packet trace along with the error running from the same time would be needed to find the root cause and resolve.",
      "Tivoli Access Manager; TAM; IBM Security Access Manager; persistent-con-timeout; exceeded TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n APAR IV75042 implies that starting from version 7.0.0.18 WebSEAL would send RST packet to client after persistent connection timeout has passed. However, customer who was running ISAM version 7.0.0.22 observed FIN packet being sent to client.\n\n\n\n\nCAUSE\nCustomer provided use case where several HTTP requests were sent to WebSEAL and one of requests was sent after persistent connection time had been exceeded ( persistent-con-timeout = 5 ). The collected TCP/IP packet trace showed FIN packet being sent to client:\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985223&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985223&aid=1]\n\n\nANSWER\nStarting with ISAM 7.0 the design was changed to send FIN packet instead for RST packet when [server] persistent-con-timeout has expired. \n\nSending FIN packet to client after persistent connection timeout has exceeded is intentional even after FP18 or newer fix pack has been applied. RST will only be received if error ( return code or timeout ) occurs before the first usage.\n\nThe design has been intentionally changed because of the negative effects of sending RST when no data has been sent (which is a non-error condition).\nThe effect of the RST is more than just closing the socket, it causes the client to clear all unread TCP buffer data.\n\nExample:\n\nAssume you are working with a bank and withdrawal $1,000,000.00 which has been successfully completed and the response sent to the browser.\n\nIf the WebSEAL has a lot of active worker threads, then the persistent-con-timeout will be scaled down. This situation could cause connection being closed faster than normal and if the browser was in the middle of reading response, RST would terminate connection unwanted matter.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why does the Multi-Protocol Gateway backside timeout get used even when setting the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout variable and streaming to the backend on IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances? \n\nCAUSE\nWhen the backside traffic is set to Stream Messages, the Multi-Protocol Gateway forwards messages before all processing is verified as complete. \n\nThis setting can potentially increase speed, but can cause the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout setting to be missed in the processing policy.\n\nANSWER\nTo avoid the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout from not being honored, considered these points:\n\n\n * Change the \"Stream Output to Back\" setting to use Buffer Messages instead of Stream Messages. \n * If using a dynamic backend for the Multi-Protocol Gateway, Stream Messages may be used as long as the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout is set prior to the backend routing destination is set.\n\n\n\nFollowing is an example Processing Policy that would allow the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout variable to be set prior to the backend destination while using streaming: \n\n\nMatch ---> Set Variable Action: var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout=10 ---> Set Variable Action \nvar://service/routing-url=<backend destination> ----> Results \n\nNote: The order of the service variables being set is important. \n\nWhen using streaming and a dynamic backend, if the backend destination is set in the Processing Policy prior to the var://service/mpgw/backend-timeout variable, the transaction will default to use the Multi-Protocol Gateway backside timeout configured.",

The .msi file is used only for silent or push installs of SPSS products. To correct the problem, you should uninstall the product, and then reinstall, but ensuring to run the Setup.exe file. We will be making improvements to rectify this issue. \n\nQ. I can\u2019t start the trial. I get the following message: Error #2085. The temporary period for running IBM SPSS Modeler without a license has expired. Use the License Authorization Wizard to contact SPSS for a license code. Execution of this command stops. Specific symptom number: 37 \nA. One or more of the following reasons may apply: \n1. Your 30 day trial period has expired for your installation. \n2. You may not have write permission to the lservrc file located in the SPSS Modeler bin directory. \nPlease log in as a local Administrator and repeat the licensing process. \n3. An incorrect system date can sometimes cause this error message to occur. Check the system date/time on your machine and if it is incorrect, please reset to the current date and try running IBM SPSS Modeler again. \n4. The lservrc file may have two or more references to the IBM SPSS Modeler base module. You may want to delete the line that refers to the earliest expiration date, save the lservrc file, and run IBM SPSS Modeler. We have found instances where IBM SPSS Modeler reads the first license for the base module, and if the expiration date for that base module has passed, IBM SPSS Modeler will return Error 2085. \n\nQ. What if I know my organization already owns the software but I do not know how to find the right person to download it or authorize it? \nA. If you are a student please contact your professor or your university IT department. If you are an IBM employee, the software is available for download on ISSI or the Mac@IBM store.

      "allocp extendlv chlv TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n This document will talk about all the possibilities and problems that might cause the failure of logical volume/file system extension. Most of the time the failure is reported with allocp error below: \n\n0516-404 allocp: This system cannot fulfill the allocation request.\nThere are not enough free partitions or not enough physical volumes\nto keep strictness and satisfy allocation requests. The command\nshould be retried with different allocation characteristics.\n\nQuestion: \n1- What does the allocp error mean? \n2- When does the extension of a logical volume fail? \n3- How can I troubleshoot and resolve the failure of the logical volume/file system extension? \n\nANSWER\n\nAnswer: \nQ1. What does the allocp error mean?\nA1. The allocp error means that the system is unable to fulfill the allocation request for the logical volume extension and that doesn't mean necessarily that the volume group doesn't have enough space. There may be other certain LVM configurations/restrictions preventing the extension of a logical volume. \n\nQ2. When does the extension of a logical volume fail?\nA2. One of the reasons below might cause the problem:\n\n1- If the logical volume has a Single Copy and there are no enough free partitions in the volume group that satisfy the request. \n\n2- If the logical volume is Mirrored and one of the disks that accommodates the mirror copies has no enough partitions to satisfy the request, yet we have enough free partitions on the volume group. The reason for this failure is the strict allocation policy of the AIX-LVM. With mirroring where several copies of the same data are used, LVM activate the strict policy by default for the mirrored logical volumes to avoid the mirroring of the same LPs on the same exact disk. A failure of that disk would result in the complete loss of the mirrored logical volume. In most circumstances, this is not a safe configuration, therefore, by default AIX-LVM does not allow you to place more than one copy of a logical partition on a given physical volume. \n\n3- If the Upper Bound attribute for the logical volume is set to a certain number of disks that have no free partitions, yet we have more disks within the volume group with free partitions. \n\nNote: The upperbound attribute, sets the maximum number of physical volumes for new allocation.\n\n4- Using a Striped Logical Volume: The logical partitions allocated for the striped logical volume must be equally located on every physical volume composing the striped logical volume, hence if the striped logical volume is scattered over three physical volumes for example and they are not equal in size then the logical volume can be only expanded by even multiple of the striping width that does not exceed the available space on the smallest disk. Yet we still have free partitions in the volume group. \n\n5- If we are using Mirror Pools: \n- Logical volumes that are enabled to use mirror pools will only allocate partitions on the physical volumes in that mirror pools, hence if we don't have free partitions on the mirror pool disks, we will not be able to extend the logical volume. Yet we may still have free space in the volume group. \n- If there is mismatch between the LVM mirroring structure and the mirror pool structure, the extension of the logical volume/filesystem will fail. \n\nQ3. How can I troubleshoot and resolve the failure of the logical volume/file system extension?\nA3. We need to look at different LVM configurations:\n\n1- If we are trying to extend a logical volume that have a single copy:\nWe need to make sure that we have enough free partitions that satisfy the extension request. By running the lsvg <VGname> and looking at the FREE PPs number we will know how may free partitions in the volume group: \n\n# lsvg testVG | grep FREE\nMAX LVs: 256 FREE PPs: 60 (1920 megabytes)\n\nSo any attempt to add more than 60 LPs to any logical volume within this volume group will fail with the allocp error. \n\n2- If we are trying to extend a mirrored logical volume:\nWe need to check the free partitions on all the disks that accommodate the both copies: \n\n# lsvg -l testVG\ntestVG:\nLV NAME TYPE LPs PPs PVs LV STATE MOUNT POINT\nloglv07 jfs2log 1 2 2 closed/syncd N/A\nfslv03 jfs2 592 1184 2 closed/syncd /testfs\nfslv17 jfs2 32 32 1 closed/syncd /testfs1\n\n# lslv -l fslv03\nfslv03:/testfs\nPV COPIES IN BAND DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk2 592:000:000 21% 128:127:127:128:082\nhdisk1 592:000:000 16% 128:095:127:128:114\n\n# lsvg -p testVG\ntestVG:\nPV_NAME PV STATE TOTAL PPs FREE PPs FREE DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk1 active 639 14 00..00..00..00..14\nhdisk2 active 639 46 00..00..00..00..46\n\n# lsvg testVG | grep FREE \nMAX LVs: 256 FREE PPs: 60 (1920 megabytes)\n\n# chfs -a size=+500M /testfs\n0516-404 allocp: This system cannot fulfill the allocation request.\nThere are not enough free partitions or not enough physical volumes\nto keep strictness and satisfy allocation requests. The command\nshould be retried with different allocation characteristics.\n\nConclusion: fslv03 logical volume is mirrored between hdisk1 and hdisk2, we can\u2019t use all the free partitions on the volume group because the strict allocation policy of AIX LVM. We only can expand the file system/logical volume by number of partitions that allow each logical partition copy to be on separate physical volume. \n\nSolution: add more disk(s) to the volume group. \n\n 3- We need to check the upper bound attribute for the logical volume to see if it is less than the number of the disks within the volume group: \n\n# lsvg -p testvg\ntestvg:\nPV_NAME PV STATE TOTAL PPs FREE PPs FREE DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk18 active 639 634 128..123..127..128..128\nhdisk19 active 639 638 128..127..127..128..128\nhdisk20 active 639 639 128..128..127..128..128\nhdisk21 active 639 639 128..128..127..128..128\n\n# lslv fslv02 | grep -i upper\nINTRA-POLICY: middle UPPER BOUND: 1\n\n# lslv -l fslv02\nfslv02:/sizefs\nPV COPIES IN BAND DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk18 005:000:000 100% 000:005:000:000:000\n\n# extendlv fslv02 640\n0516-404 allocp: This system cannot fulfill the allocation request.\nThere are not enough free partitions or not enough physical volumes\nto keep strictness and satisfy allocation requests.

To avoid this issue to happen again, initially we should create the striped logical volumes in disks that have equal sizes. \n\n5- If the logical volume is enabled for mirror pools: \n\na. We need to check the free partitions on the mirror pool disks: \n# lsvg -l testvg\ntestvg:\nLV NAME TYPE LPs PPs PVs LV STATE MOUNT POINT\nfslv02 jfs2 5 10 2 closed/syncd /sizefs\nloglv02 jfs2log 1 1 1 closed/syncd N/A\n\n# lslv fslv02 | grep -i POOL\nCOPY 1 MIRROR POOL: PoolA\nCOPY 2 MIRROR POOL: PoolB\nCOPY 3 MIRROR POOL: None\n\n# lsvg -P testvg\nPhysical Volume Mirror Pool\nhdisk18 PoolA\nhdisk19 PoolB\nhdisk20 None\nhdisk21 None\n\n# lsvg -p testvg\ntestvg:\nPV_NAME PV STATE TOTAL PPs FREE PPs FREE DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk18 active 636 631 125..125..127..127..127\nhdisk19 active 636 630 127..122..127..127..127\nhdisk20 active 636 636 128..127..127..127..127\nhdisk21 active 636 636 128..127..127..127..127\n\n# lsvg -m testvg\nLogical Volume Copy 1 Copy 2 Copy 3\nfslv02 PoolA PoolB None\nloglv02 None None None\n\n# extendlv fslv02 640\n0516-404 allocp: This system cannot fulfill the allocation request.\nThere are not enough free partitions or not enough physical volumes\nto keep strictness and satisfy allocation requests. The command\nshould be retried with different allocation characteristics.\n\nConclusion: Because the logical volume is enabled to use the mirror pools so it will only allocate partitions on the physical volumes assigned to this mirror pools. \n\nSolution: Add more disks to the mirror pools: \n\n# chpv -p PoolA hdisk20\n# chpv -p PoolB hdisk21\n# extendlv fslv02 640\n# \n\nb. If we have free partitions on the mirror pool disks and the new allocation request still failing then we need to make sure that the mirror pool structure is in sync with the LVM mirroring structure. Mirror pools have a separate structure from LVM mirroring. Information for mirror pool is stored in 3 places: PV, LV and VG. In some cases, you can remove a copy of a logical volume with rmlvcopy (not in LVM anymore), but mirror pool commands will still show it as an existent copy. That will cause LVM commands to fail. So we need to make sure LVM commands (mirrorvg, mklvcopy...) and Mirror Pool commands (chpv -p, chlv -m copy1=.., chvg -M....) are in sync all the time. \n\nExample: \n1- Created a new scalable volume group with two disks and created two mirror pools:\n# mkvg -S \u2013y testvg hdisk1 hdisk2 \n# chpv -p pool1 hdisk1\n# chpv -p pool2 hdisk2\n\n2- Created logical volume and enabled mirror pools to the copies of the logical volume:\n# mklv -t jfs2 \u2013y testlv testvg 10\n# chlv -m copy1=pool1 testlv\n# chlv -m copy2=pool2 testlv\n\n3- Created mirror copies of the logical volume and synchronized them: \n# mklvcopy testlv 2 \n# syncvg \u2013v testvg\n\n4- Lets say I need to replace hdisk1 with new disk \"hdisk3\": \n\n4.1. I added a new disk to the volume group, created a new mirror pool and enabled the logical volume for using the new mirror pool and added a mirror copy for the logical volume a well: \n\n# extendvg -p pool3 testvg hdisk3\n# chlv -m copy3=pool3 testlv\n# mklvcopy testlv 3 hdisk3\n# syncvg -v testvg \n\nAt this point the LVM structure is in sync with the mirror pool structure as we can see below: \n# lsvg -m testvg\nLogical Volume Copy 1 Copy 2 Copy 3\ntestlv pool1 pool2 pool3\n\n# lsvg -l testvg\ntestvg:\nLV NAME TYPE LPs PPs PVs LV STATE MOUNT POINT\ntestlv jfs2 10 30 3 closed/syncd N/A\n\n4.2. Removed a copy for the logical volume with rmlvcopy and reduced hdisk1 form the volume group: \n\n# rmlvcopy testlv 2 hdisk1\n# reducevg testvg hdisk1\n\nAt this point a mirror copy is removed from the LVM structure but not from the mirror pool structure, because this is not the recommended way to replace disks from a mirror pool, we can see that mismatch between the mirror pool structure and the LVM structure using the commands below:\n\n# lsvg -m testvg\nLogical Volume Copy 1 Copy 2 Copy 3\ntestlv <== pool2 pool3 \n\nNote: If there is no mirror pool assigned to copy 1, it should say None. \n\n# readvgda hdisk2 | grep -p \"LV 1\"\n------- LV 1 ------\nlvname: testlv\nlv_state: 1\nflags: 0x21\nmirror_policy: 2\nnum_lps: 10\nmaxsize: 512\nstripe_exp: 0\nstriping_width: 0\nlv_avoid: 0\nchild_min_num: 0\nupperbound: 1024\nlv_opt: 0x6\nstrict: y\nrelocatable: y\ninterpolicy: m\nintrapolicy: m\nmirror_pool[]: 1 2 3 <==\n------ lvcb ------\ntype: jfs2\ncreated_time: Mon Apr 4 06:28:55 2016\nmodified_time: Mon Apr 4 08:17:42 2016\nmod_machine_id: 7A9674C00\nlabel: None\nfs:\ndev_uid: 0\ndev_gid: 0\ndev_perm: 432\n------------------\n\n# lsvg -p testvg\ntestvg:\nPV_NAME PV STATE TOTAL PPs FREE PPs FREE DISTRIBUTION\nhdisk2 active 1275 1265 255..205..255..255..255\nhdisk3 active 1275 1265 255..205..255..255..255\n\n# extendlv testlv 1\n0516-404 allocp: This system cannot fulfill the allocation request.\nThere are not enough free partitions or not enough physical volumes\nto keep strictness and satisfy allocation requests. The command\nshould be retried with different allocation characteristics.\n\nConclusion: \nThe new allocation request is trying to use partitions from mirror pool that no longer exists, because there is a mismatch between the LVM mirroring structure and the mirror pool structure. \n\nSolution: \n1. Remove mirror pools totally from the system for this VG: from LV and PV level: \n# chlv -M 1 testlv\n# chlv -M 2 testlv \n# chlv -M 3 testlv\n# chpv -P hdisk2\n# chpv -P hdisk3\n\n2. Assign the disks to new mirror pools. \n# chpv -p pool1 hdisk2\n# chpv -p pool2 hdisk3\n\n3. Enable the mirror pools to the logical volumes.\n# chlv -m copy1=pool1 testlv\n# chlv -m copy2=pool2 testlv\n\n4. Now we can extend the logical volume without a problem: \n# extendlv testlv 2\n#\n\nThe commands below are to confirm that the LVM and the mirror pool structure are in sync: \n\n# lsvg -m testvg\nLogical Volume Copy 1 Copy 2 Copy 3\ntestlv pool pool2 None\n\n# readvgda hdisk2 | grep -p \"LV 1\"\n------- LV 1 ------\nlvname: testlv\nlv_state: 1\nflags: 0x21\nmirror_policy: 2\nnum_lps: 12\nmaxsize: 512\nstripe_exp: 0\nstriping_width: 0\nlv_avoid: 0\nchild_min_num: 0\nupperbound: 1024\nlv_opt: 0x6\nstrict: y\nrelocatable: y\ninterpolicy: m\nintrapolicy: m\nmirror_pool[]: 1 2 0 <==\n------ lvcb ------\ntype: jfs2\ncreated_time: Mon Apr 4 09:02:00 2016\nmodified_time: Mon Apr 4 09:10:19 2016\nmod_machine_id: 7A9674C00\nlabel: None\nfs:\ndev_uid: 0\ndev_gid: 0\ndev_perm: 432\n------------------\n\nSuggestion: \nIf we need to remove all the disks from a mirror pool and assign new disks to it: \n1. Remove mirror pools totally from the system for this VG: from LV and PV level. \n2. Remove unnecessary mirror at LVM level (unmirrorvg from the disks that need to be replaced).\n3. Remove the disks from the volume group and assign new disks. \n4. Create LVM mirror to the new disks. \n5. Create new mirror pools and enable the logical volume copies to use mirror pools.\n\nIBM's support team is committed to assisting you in obtaining the highest value from our products and services.\n\nRegards,\nMohamed Othman\n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n -",

On further investigation, we discovered\n   that the\n   following fields had not been included in the dbconfig cascade\n   of\n   updates presumably because they don't have a 'same as' set:\n   \n   plusgmocrequest.wonum\n   plusgmoc.wonum\n   plusgact.wonum\n   plusgdrl.wonum\n   plusgrelatedrec.relatedrecwonum\n   \n   As a result, we had to roll back our changes as every time we\n   tried to\n   modify these in dbconfig, they reverted back to the original\n   field\n   length.\n   \n   \n   Customer and then upgraded their system to 7.5.0.3 last week,\n   and\n   looking at the wonum length change issue, it has not been fixed.\n   \n   See screenshot below - I changed workorder.wonum from 12 to 14\n   and\n   saved. Prior to switching to admin mode and running the\n   dbconfig, I went\n   to look at the list of changes as a result of updating the wonum\n   length,\n   and specifically looked for the problematic attributes as listed\n   in the\n   original issue sent to yourselves.\n   \n   For example, you can see below that the dbconfig for PLUSGACT\n   changes\n   the displaywonum attribute but it does not change the wonum\n   attribute.\n   The 7.5.0.3 fix does not resolve this issue\n   \n   when you actually go into the object to see which attributes are\n   flagged\n   to change, you'll find that there are a few which aren't set.\n   \n   plusgmocrequest.wonum\n   plusgmoc.wonum\n   plusgact.wonum\n   plusgdrl.wonum\n   plusgrelatedrec.relatedrecwonum\n   \n   For example, PLUSGMOC shows the attributes to change listed\n   below...\n   \n   But if you then go filter within PLUSGMOC object for `wonum' you\n   will see that DISPLAYWONUM has been marked for change, but WONUM\n   hasn't\n   \n   The DISPLAYWONUM attribute has a `same as' set.\n   \n   The `WONUM' attribute has not. With this being a view, I cannot\n   edit the same as attributes.\n   \n   Then to test the dbconfig once it has been applied, go to Work\n   Order\n   Tracking (Oil) and create a new Work Order, and manually enter a\n   large\n   number (if you've not updated the autonum seed just need to add\n   a few\n   digits to the end of the wonum)\n   \n   And hence, we go back to the list above, which has `wonum'\n   fields\n   which have not been updated during dbconfig to the new longer\n   length.\n   Running the integrity checker in report mode did not reveal any\n   and the\n   refresh of index had been performed but made no difference.\n   \n   Steps to replicate:\n   \n   Login as maxadmin\n   \n   Access Database Configuration Application\n   \n   Open object, WORKORDER\n   \n   Go to Attribute tab\n   \n   Enter WONUM in the filter and press enter\n   \n   Change the default Length from 10 to 14\n   \n   Save change\n   \n   Go to List tab\n   \n   Filter for Objects \"plusg\" and Service \"workorder\"\n   \n   You will see that all use of workorder have the status of \"To Be\n   Changed\"\n   \n   Plusgmoc\n   Plusgmocrequest\n   Plusgact\n   Plusgdrl\n   \n   Open the PLUSGMOC Object and go to Attribute (filter for wonum)\n   \n   I have found that my own 7503 (direct install not an upgrade)\n   \n   PLUSGMOC, wonum field has more details listed.\n   \n   however the customer has the following information missing, i.e.\n   fields\n   are blank for wonum field in Object,  PLUSGMOC:\n   \n   Same as Object: WORKORDER\n   Same as Attribute: is WONUM\n   \n   The out-of-the-box 7502 Maximo environment also has this\n   information\n   missing .

In Catia V5, create New Product\n   2. In the Created Product do TeamPDM->Insert Part/Product\n   3. Find a Any Catia Part that may be in your Database.\n   In the SmarTeam Reasearch Windows, try to have more that\n   the 4 following attributs (ID, state, Revision, class) in\n   the Grid (by doing Grid Property), for exemple a want the\n   Part Number attribut.\n   You will notice that if you do the same query in\n   SmarTeam, you can add all the attributs of the class in\n   the Grid.\n   \n   \n   Hello Guillaume,\n   I tried to reproduce your scenario and here is my result:\n   When you say you're trying to add some attributes , is it in\n   the Grid property- Query - Visual settings panel window or\n   when you click modify in the search editor window?\n    If I click modify on this window, I can add any attributes\n   I want (click attributes in the next window ) even if I m in\n   Catia or SmarTeam.\n   Thank you for your cooperation,\n   Best regards,\n   Etienne\n   \n   \n   Additional Information:\n   It is in the Grid Properties - Query - Visual.\n   Regrads,\n   Guillaume.\n   \n   \n   Additional Information:\n   Etienne,\n   Watch difference in Grid Properties when searching by\n   attributs of simple search (option 1 and 2) in the TeamPDM\n   -; Find Document.\n   Option 1 seems useless in an industrial environement (ex\n   more than 800 catia parts). Same for Icone in V5R7 SP2.\n   \n   \n   Additional Information:\n   Can you please create an APAR for this issue. We would like\n   a\n   V5R7SP4 target date. This shouldn't a big issue to fixe (it\n   seems\n   to be just a GUI choice when openning gird windows on Insert\n   Part\n   search?).\n   Regards,\n   Guillaume.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:\n   There are differences beetween the two modes of research in\n   team pdm that justify the existence of both separately.\n   \n   1.The 'normal' search editor ( Tpdm>Find>Find document ) allows\n   to access to public and private queries. You can create and save\n   a query from this window or the 'search by attribute'window\n   but the only way and the fastest to run this 'saved' query is\n   by using this search editor window. Then we can't delete it.\n   As this is the only way to execute saved query, it s normal that\n   this function is launched by the search icon.\n   \n   2- The 'search by attribute' (Tpdm>find>find document by\n   attribute) allows you to determine wich attibutes will be\n   displayed in the grid result. Note that if you saved a query,\n   attributes to be displayed will be also saved.\n   \n   Conclusion:\n   There is one tool that allows you to customize queries and\n   choose the attibutes you want to display and there is another\n   tool that allows you to run a saved query directly.\n   There is also one point that we consider as a constraintly\n   behavior:  When you create a new query, the attibutes choosen in\n   the last query you did are not set by default. Each time you\n   create a query you have to reselest all attributes.\n   You can also customize the Quickfind.bs script.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   HC86794\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   CATIA V5 NT_INT\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   569151000\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   507\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED USE\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2001-10-26\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2001-11-13\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2001-11-13\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS"

They are created when ejbdeploy is executed successfully for the first time. If it has never been executed successfully in your environment, then the directories will not be there.\n\n2.

As part of the migration process, the v8 profile is created using the same nodename as the Portal server from the source environment. WASPostUpgrade creates the webserver definition under this nodename and correctly maps the applications to the Webserver on the target environment using the nodename specified for the v8 profile. However, Portal migration scripts still used the nodename from the source environment for the Webserver instead of the newly specified one for the v8 profile.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n1. Locate the Jython script for the application that failed to deploy in the backup_dir created by the WASPreUpgrade command: \n\n \n\n<backup_dir>/profiles/wp_profile/PortalApps \n\n \n\n2. Open the Jython script in a text editor and change the webserver nodename to the one specified for the v8 profile in the manageprofiles command. For example, you may change this: \n\n\n# Add Mapping for \"TemplateLibrary_Servlets\" to server \"webserver1\" on node \"MyWebserverNode\".\nAdminApp.edit('TemplateLibrary_Servlets', ['-MapModulesToServers', [['.*', '.*', '+WebSphere:node=MyWebserverNode,server=webserver1']]]) \nAdminConfig.save()\n\n\nto this:\n\n\n# Add Mapping for \"TemplateLibrary_Servlets\" to server \"webserver1\" on node \"newV8Nodename\".\nAdminApp.edit('TemplateLibrary_Servlets', ['-MapModulesToServers', [['.*', '.*', '+WebSphere:node=newV8Nodename,server=webserver1']]]) \nAdminConfig.save()\n\n\n3. Save and close the file.\n4. Use wsadmin to deploy the application ( wsadmin is located in <AppServer root>/bin ). For example,\n\nwsadmin> execfile(\"install_TemplateLibrary_Servlets.py\")\n\nReference the following link for details on the wsadmin command:\nhttp://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/welc6topscripting.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/welc6topscripting.html]\n\n\n5. Repeat the above steps for every application that failed to deploy. \n\n \n\nThis is fixed in APAR PM87204 which will be included in CF06 and higher for Portal 8. It is recommended to apply the latest CF to both the source and target environments prior to starting the migration process.\n\n\n\n\n * \n *",

After applying the 7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Fix Packs, the new business object runtime framework for version 7 is also available. While available to all users of 7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2, current usage of the version 7 business object runtime framework is designed for and should only be used by early adopters and for development usage only. IBM provides the version 7 business object runtime framework technology preview \"as is\" and does not include IBM support as specified in the version 7 WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus license agreement under the terms for Technology Preview Code. Feedback and questions regarding version 7 business object runtime framework can be directed to the WebSphere Process Server forum [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=820].\n\n\n\nIssues resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor with this Fix Pack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows all of the issues resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2. \n\n\nAPAR Problem Description JR34783 With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, the Dimensions and Reports widgets do not always correctly resize when the browser window is resized. JR34980 If multiple consecutive events fail to be processed for a monitor model due to \"no correlation match\", all of the event processing threads may deadlock, resulting in event processing halting for the model. JR34992 When the Instances widget is refreshed, any text in the Search field is automatically cleared, forcing you to re-enter the search text if it is still needed. JR35001 With Oracle as the database, with a high volume of open monitoring contexts for a model with recurring wait time triggers, processing of the triggers might result in the following SQLException:ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000 JR35017 When the browser language is Hebrew, duration values are not displayed correctly. JR35073 When using queue bypass event routing, event consumption by the moderator from the INBOUND_EVENTS table may perform slowly, especially if there are a large number of events in the table. JR35077 With queue bypass event routing, if the event consumption batch size (monitor model runtime configuration parameter) is set to 1000 (its maximum value), when the moderator attempts to query the INCOMING_EVENTS table to retrieve unconsumed events, the query will fail and no events will be consumed. An error message indicating an SQL error will be written to the moderator SystemOut.log file, at each attempt to consume events. JR35114 During data replication by Data Movement Service, the database transaction log may fill during a preprocessing step, causing the replication to fail. The SystemOut.log file will contain the following error: SQLCODE: -964, SQLSTATE: 57011 JR35121 When you configure the Dimensions widget to use the cube \"<model name> (All Versions)\" for a monitor model with multiple versions deployed, and the dimensional model for the monitor model has been changed between deployed versions, the widget might not display correct information. JR35142 In the Instances view, if you apply a time filter using a time zone other than GMT, the instance export function will not export the correct set of data based on the time filter; it incorrectly behaves as if the time zone in the filter specification is GMT. JR35147 When an SCA notification alert is generated (by the action services component), the alert generation fails and the following error message is written to SystemOut.log: \n\ncom.ibm.wbimonitor.actionmgr.handling.ScaHandler handleEvent (CommonBaseEvent, int, Hashtable) CWMAA2119E: SCA is not available on this platform. Notification not completed. JR35195 In Windows Vista, when using the Microsoft Excel add-in, clicking Preferences to assign a Monitor server to the add-in does not display the dialog box. JR35218 A change to the notification type in a notification template is not reflected in the notifications sent when an outbound event matching a situation event binding (to which the template is associated) is generated. JR35256 The moveMCInstances script may fail with an exception similar to the following:\n\n000000a0 QueueRecovery E com.ibm.wbimonitor.repository.QueueRecoveryUtil doMigrationForMC(MonitoringContextType oldMC) <Null Message> com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.SqlException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-805, SQLSTATE=51002, SQLERRMC=NULLID.SYSLN2030X5359534C564C3031, DRIVER=3.52.110 JR35273 When an e-mail notification for an alert is generated, if during user lookup and validation the federated repository returns an unexpected object (in response to a query issued by Monitor), the e-mail notification will not be sent to any intended user. JR35278 The \"less than\" character ('<') in a KPI name or description causes the Alert Manager widget to fail. JR35313 In the Instances widget, if you are specifying a data filter and enter a string in the \"Search for:\" field that includes a single quote character ('), the search will fail and the displayed instance data will not be refreshed to reflect the data filter. You may see a red 'X', or an error message. JR35452 Resubmission of a failed event sequence may fail with an exception similar to the following:\n\n00000075 ConsumerBeanE E com.ibm.wbimonitor.mm.myModelMM.20100420000000.moderator.ConsumerBeanEventResubmission processMessagesInNormalState CWMRT0044E: An unrecognized error occurred while processing an event. The message will be retried.\nMonitoring Model ID: myModelMM \nMonitoring Model Version: 20091211000000\nCaused by: com.ibm.wbimonitor.server.moderator.exception.\nUnknownEventException: com.ibm.wbimonitor.persistence.exceptions. \nUnknownEventIdException: Unknown DB ID : 88A3F6731D8B5D10E35823C4\n\nWhen this occurs, no additional failed event sequences are processed. JR35504 If WebSphere Business Monitor is installed on the same stand-alone server as ILOG \nand WebSphere Business Services Fabric, when you try to create the schema for an monitor model, the following error occurs:\n\ncom.ibm.wbimonitor.lifecycle.LifecycleServices getMonitorDBUser(String) Did not find user name for datasource jdbc/wbm/MonitorAdminDatabase. JR35547 When the CEI distribution mode for a monitor model (version) is \"Active (no new MC instances)\", an inbound event received by the model version that does not correlate to any existing instance may remain in the CONSUMED_EVENT table, causing event processing to effectively halt. JR35563 If an LDAP server is not configured for, or does not support, lookup of users by e-mail address, e-mail alert notification may fail. JR35575 In the Dimensions and Reports widgets, the \"Show Instances\" function may display too many instances in the Instances widget, due to incorrect filtering. JR35592 The cube refresh settings configured for the scheduled service for Alphablox cube caching are not reflected in the Dimensions portlet in WebSphere Portal. JR35598 When a monitor model is running, it may encounter a condition that requires the model to automatically restart itself to recover; this restart fails because the shutdown phase cannot complete. JR35602 In the KPI widget, if a decimal KPI is displayed as a gauge or half gauge and does not have any user-defined ranges, the following display issues occur:\n * If the KPI value is smaller than 5, and the decimal precision is 0, some values displayed on the tick marks repeat, \n * The values displayed on the tick marks may not be uniformly spaced and may not accurately represent integer values.\n\nJR35659 If events and instances are manually deleted from the failed event queue tables (tables named EQ_*), then failed event processing may cease to function correctly. JR35707 When a monitor model that is using queue based event routing is restarted, events will not be processed if events that were previously consumed by the model had not been fully removed from database tables used during consumption at the time the model was last stopped. JR35708 An expression evaluation error during event processing may cause event processing to loop infinitely (processing the same event repeatedly). JR35737 In the WebSphere Business Monitor test environment, when a monitoring context ID contains non-ASCII characters (for example, Portuguese characters), all metrics will always be \ndisplayed even if only some metrics are selected to be displayed. This issue only occurs in the test environment and not in the WebSphere Business Monitor (server) product. JR35792 When you uninstall an older version of a monitor model, where the newest version is using queue bypass transport and the older version was using queue based transport, the JMS queues used by the older version are removed, but bindings to the queues are not removed. As a result, event consumption in the newest version stops due to a failed attempt to resolve the bindings in the newest version. JR35938 The Unrecoverable Events page in the administrative console does not display any events for a monitoring context if a count of 1 event is displayed for the monitoring context. JR36063 When the script ConfigCEIForMQClients to establish the MQ to CEI link is executed, it fails with the error \"CEI service integration bus was not found.\" JR36120 The following internally identified issues have been resolved:\n\nIssues in monitor model installation:  * If you install a second monitor model immediately after installing the first, without leaving the Monitor Models page in the administrative console, the second monitor model will fail to install with an error message stating that there is a save conflict in saving the changes to the master configuration. \n * Need to improve the error message displayed during model installation when it cannot be determined whether CEI routing plug-ins are installed on the CEI target server. \n * When the target CEI server is not running during model installation, it cannot be determined whether CEI routing plug-ins are installed. \n * The deployment manager must be running for a monitor model to be installed successfully, in a network deployment environment. (V7.0.0.2 removes this dependency.) \n * You cannot install a monitor model in a cross-cell configuration where the remote CEI target is in a WebSphere Process Server V7.0 cell running on z/OS. \n * Headless deploy does not install a monitor model for which the .mm file is located in a subdirectory within the specified project interchange file.\n\n\nOperational issues:  * With WebSphere Application Server V7.0.0.9, a monitor model using queue based event routing may be subject to locked message conditions (error CWMRT0031E written to SystemOut.log), during which time no inbound events will be consumed. \n * There is a memory leak in the com.ibm.wbimonitor.xsp.eventselector plug-in, which can manifest itself on a WebSphere server hosting CEI under certain error conditions. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, Data Movement Service performs slowly. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, there is an intermittent error in Data Movement Service. \n * In the emitter REST services, if tracing is enabled (trace string includes \"com.ibm.wbimonitor.emitter.*=all\"), a NullPointerException will occur when the emitter sends an event with an XML header. \n * In the Global Human Task monitor model, when a human task is completed, the associated DELETED event fails to correlate with any instance (it is always routed to the failed events queue). \n * The xs:dayTimeDuration function may return an incorrect result if time zone information is not provided in each of the dateTime elements (literals or XPath expressions) in the expression used as the argument to the function; the result will be dependent on the system time zone. \n * When the time zone of a DateTime value is GMT, the time zone information is not included in the value. \n * The Alphablox application versions are not written to SystemOut.log at startup.\n\n\nIssues in the administrative console:  * With Oracle as the database, enablement of Data Movement Service from the administrative console fails. \n * In the administrative console, when you save the \"Error handling\" tab under Monitor Models > <model_name>_<version> > Change runtime configuration, the \"Stop if an event that cannot be interpreted is received\" checkbox is turned off any time you save changes to the runtime configuration, even if you do not modify that setting.\n\n\nIssues in the Microsoft Excel add-in:  * The Instances page size setting is not saved from the Preferences dialog. \n * The refresh interval setting is not saved from the Preferences dialog if the Instances page size setting is also changed.\n\n\nIssues in the WebSphere Business Monitor widgets:  * Monitor widgets execute multiple endpoint lookups when only one is required (performance impact). \n * The KPI widget needs to optimize how it retrieves KPI ranges when there are multiple KPIs. \n * With a large number of KPIs in the KPI widget, the bottom of the widget pane may extend through other widgets on the page. \n * Setting the \"Enable this widget to send events over wires\" checkbox for two widgets in a page created from the Monitor template does not automatically wire the widgets together. \n * In the KPI History and Prediction widget, when creating a KPI prediction model for a KPI with no time period for aggregation function AVG, the widget hangs (an error message popup should be displayed instead). \n * With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, the Save Format button is not readily visible when the Dimensions widget is opened in edit mode. \n * The KPI widget in the mobile dashboard does not work correctly. \n * When you open or refresh any page which contains the Alert Manager widget, the following message is written to SystemOut.log as an error ('E') but should be informational ('I'): 0000003b BusinessSitua E com.ibm.wbimonitor.actionmgr.resources.apis.BusinessSituationResourceAccess getBusinessSituations() SECURITY_ENABLED seen \n * In the Alert Manager widget, the Search field only automatically adds a wildcard character to the end of the entered word, and not the beginning of the word. \n * After migration from Version 6.1.2 to Version 7.0, no data appears in the Reports widget. \n * After migration from Version 6.1.2 to Version 7.0, the cube for a migrated model can no longer be configured in the Dimensions or Reports widget (the error \"Unable to load\u2026\" is displayed). \n * After migration from previous versions of WebSphere Business Monitor to Version 7, when a model is redeployed to Version 7, KPIs and alerts previously created in the dashboard are not preserved.\n\n\nIssues in the Global Process monitor model:  * If multiple versions of the Global Process model are installed, outbound events that are sent back to the model get sent to all installed versions, not just the latest version. \n * The Global Process model cannot monitor ad hoc tasks. \n * Subtask hierarchies are not sorted by the \"Aus Start Time Hierarchy\" metric by default. \n * When you click the Process Statistics tab or Task Statistics tab in the pre-configured space for the Global Process model, a warning message is displayed stating that a saved query is no longer in the database. \n * The column \"Indented Name\" is not shown by default in the \"Subtask hierarchy\" tab in the pre-configured space for the Global Process model. \n * Two defined events are missing step qualified names.\n\n\nIssues in the Profile Management Tool / manageprofiles command:  * The Profile Management Tool might incorrectly display \"null\" for two fields for the CEI database in the Summary panel when the database is already configured. \n * In the Profile Management Tool, the label for the \"DB2 client\" checkbox for the CEI database implies that it needs to be checked for a local CEI database. \n * In the Profile Management Tool, Type 2 data source creation does not work (even if selected, a Type 4 data source is created). \n * Profile update does not support system commands. \n * The manageprofiles script does not create the database script output directory if it does not already exist, causing it to fail. \n * The -wbmDBJDBCClasspath parameter for the manageprofiles command does not have a default value if the database is DB2 z/OS V9.1.\n\n\nIssues in the Installation Verification Tool:  * The CEI data source might not be located, even if it is configured correctly. \n * Uninstallation of the Mortgage Lending model fails.\n\n\nOther issues:  * With Derby as the database, profile creation fails if the schema name is not upper case (i. e. lower case or mixed case). \n * The authentication alias set for the Monitor admin data source during profile creation is the Monitor authentication alias, not the Monitor admin authentication alias. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, if the driver is type 2, the Monitor data source is created incorrectly. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, a type 2 driver might encounter issues caused by a data source pre-test. \n * When a WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition profile is augmented with Monitor, the CEI data store component is disabled. \n * In the WebSphere test environment, WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition cannot be selected as the base server profile for Monitor augmentation. \n * The runAAMExport.sh and runAAMEncrypt.sh scripts do not work correctly. \n * The properties file for the MM App Updater tool needs to clearly document that values cannot have trailing spaces. \n * If the deployment environment wizard fails, or changes get discarded after the wizard completes, a portion of the configuration gets saved. \n * \"wbmDeployBusinessSpace\" is listed as a valid command in the help for the \"BusinessMonitorConfiguration\" wsadmin task. \n * Database (persistence) tracing for failed event management is not available.\n\n\n\n\nIssues resolved in Business Space with this Fix Pack \n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows all of the issues resolved in Business Space in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2. \n\nAPAR Problem Description JR35235 During the creation of a Deployment Environment (using the Deployment Environment creation wizard in the administrative console), if you specify Oracle9i as the database, then the Deployment environment creation fails with the following error:\n\n00000036 WBI_BSpace_Cm E\ncom.ibm.wbiserver.nd.topology.commands.impl.WBI_BSpace_Cmd \nconfigure CWLDB9014E: The configuration of component WBI_BSPACE failed.\nReason\ncom.ibm.wbi.utils.configservice.WBIConfigException: BCSB1103I: \nThe selected database is not supported by Business Space..... JR35309 The following internally identified issues have been resolved (note that all of these issues were originally resoved in Business Space V7.0 Interim Fix 1):\n\nIssues within the Lotus Mashups embedded component:  * After creating a space that is not designated as a favorite, the space shows up in the Favorites view (although refreshing the page removes the space from the Favorites view). \n * After exporting a page, and then re-importing the page back into Business Space, the language used in the page may suddenly change. \n * If the owner of a space changes a page in the space (for example, dragging a widget onto the page), but the space owner is changed before the page is saved, when the new owner accesses the page, the changes made by the original space owner are lost. \n * After hiding spaces in the space manager, sometimes the visual indicator that tells you that the space is hidden does not display. \n * After changing a page owner to a different user, when you attempt to change the page owner a second time, the first owner remains the page owner. \n * When you search for users using a partial name, the results do not display the users that meet that search criteria. For example, if you type \"a\" in the search field and start the search, no users are found, even those users who have names that start with that character. \n * When using Internet Explorer, when you open and close various dialog boxes, you may notice a memory leak in your browser, sometimes as high as 5 MB for each open-and-close action. This occurs in the following scenarios:. \n * Drag a widget onto a page, click the configuration icon at the top of the widget, and select Edit Settings. After you close the configuration dialog box, you may experience close to 1MB of memory leak. \n * You may also notice memory leaks when working with pages continuously for long periods of time. \n * When working in a clustered server environment, you may notice that pages do not load properly because they fail to retrieve the default page theme. \n * Events do not get sent multiple times across pages. \n * Dependency/catalog federation issues exist involving URLs without ports and case-insensitive hostname comparisons.\n\n\nIssues in Portal migration:  * An exception may occur during layout migration, causing some pages to fail to migrate. \n * Configuration information for some widgets is lost during migration, causing those widgets to not work properly after migration. \n * After migration, some widgets may hang while loading. \n * Private pages cannot be migrated. \n * Migration of WPS/WESB Version 6.2 feature pack widgets is not supported. \n * The Draft Projects widget (in Business Compass) and ProcessDefinitionList widget (in Human Task Management) do not load on Portal after migration. \n * Changes to page layout prior to migration are not preserved; the resulting layout is always the three columns layout.\n\n\nOther migration issues:  * Changes to widget size prior to data migration are not preserved; the widget size after migration is always the default size. \n * Wiring information for widgets does not correctly migrate from previous releases. \n * Access control lists relating to user distinguished names are not migrated correctly.\n\n\nConfiguration issues:  * Business Space configuration fails to augment a profile to use an existing local SQL Server database. \n * Manual configuration of Business Space with WebForm Server fails. \n * Augmentation of a profile for Business Space to use an existing local SQL Server reports that the database operation failed. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, the data source used by Business Space is created incorrectly during profile configuration, storing a database name instead of a connection/database location name.\n\n\nNavigation/display issues:  * If you click \"Home\" inside a page with unsaved changes, you are not prompted to save your changes and so the changes are lost. \n * When you navigate away from a page with a hidden widget, a NullPointerException occurs. \n * If a page is hidden from the view list, the page edit setting dialog does not close when you click the Save button. \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, in drop down menus, if the text is wider than the field, excess white space is displayed on the left and right side of the drop down button. (The text will now occupy the entire width of the field without the excess white space.) \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, a security warning dialog appears after a widget's menu item is selected and then a page tab is clicked. \n * When using Internet Explorer, the edit panel of the Script Adapter widget is stretched to take the entire width of the browser window. \n * When using Internet Explorer, the edit panel of the Script Adapter and Website widgets are not the correct size. \n * When using Internet Explorer in a right-to-left environment (Arabic or Hebrew), moving the mouse over a widget results in the widget being drawn in an incorrect position. \n * When using Firefox, the Web Feed widget is not visible when it is displayed on a page outside of Business Space. \n * The content of a widget in the top row of a multi-row layout (T, I or inverted T) changes size based on content and overlaps the widgets in the row below it. \n * When using the Task Information widget to display a completed task form, the read-only fields of the form are not greyed out when displaying the form using Webform Server. \n * The sample URLs for the following widgets: Spreadsheet, Document and Presentation require a leading slash in URL location to load. \n * When displaying event information in the Script Adapter widget, an error value is shown when the event payload type is numeric or is empty. \n * Using a direct URL to open a space without providing a page ID causes an error. \n * When you view a global page within a space and then log out, the next time you log in the global page is still visible, but appears within a different space. \n * The wiring dialog displays the event code name instead of the event title (as defined in the widget XML). \n * Some translation issues exist for the Portuguese-Brazilian language.\n\n\nOther operational issues:  * When using SQLServer with the Data Direct JDBC driver to retrieve Blob data type personalization data, an exception is encountered. \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, there is a memory leak. \n * The GZIPOutputStream has a memory leak.\n\nJR36106 Business Space does not display the owner name after the creation of a space in some scenarios. JR36435 The following additional internally identified issues have been resolved:\n\nIssues within the Lotus Mashups embedded component:  * When you attempt to leave a unsaved page and go to another page, a dialog box displays that prompts you to either save or undo your changes. If you click Undo several times, and then click Save, the page you are trying to access is unexpectedly replaced by the page you just saved. \n * Users with view permission incorrectly have certain edit rights for spaces. When using the tabbed theme, sometimes users who have only view permission for a space can reorder the pages in that space, but only users with edit permission should be able to reorder pages in spaces. (In V7.0.0.2, only users with edit permission can reorder pages in spaces.) \n * When you attempt to create a new space with an unsaved page open, the dialog box that prompts you to save the page displays twice.\n\n\nMigration issues:  * The batch files for updating the Business Space database schema cannot be invoked on non-Windows platforms after profile migration. The files that are generated by Business Space do not have execution privilege.\n\n\nConfiguration issues:  * Database related exceptions occur if Business Space and DB2 are configured on the same z/OS image. \n * The Team List widget service endpoints must always end with a '/', for example, http://myserver:9080/UserImageWeb/UserImageServlet/images/. \n * The currentSQLID custom property always has to be assigned additional privileges for the Business Space data source. (In V7.0.0.2, this property has been removed.) \n * If you run the administrative task \"configureBusinessSpace\" with the \"-replaceDatasource\" parameter, an error message saying that the JNDI value \"jdbc/mashupDS\" (data source) exists is displayed. \n * When profiles are upgraded after maintenance is applied (Interim Fix or Fix Pack), existing endpoints will default to the original Business Space endpoint locations, possibly overwriting custom endpoints. \n * Additional command line help text is needed for Business Space administrative tasks.\n\n\nNavigation/display issues:  * With Internet Explorer 7 as the browser, in the Team List widget, when the hierarchy of a team is three or more levels deep, the tree does not show the third level correctly. \n * With Internet Explorer as the browser, in the Palette, if Hebrew or Arabic is the browser language, the order of the parentheses for the number of viewers is incorrect. \n * With Internet Explorer as the browser, if option 'script debugging(Internet Explorer)' is turned on, login with a non-secure profile fails, and no script error is displayed. \n * With Internet Explorer 6 as the browser, the height of a widget after maximize and restore fills the entire height of the column. \n * Maximizing any widget causes it to be sized larger than the current browser window instead of filling the window. \n * When a widget is configured with a default height, the default height is not applied. \n * The positioning of fly-out menus in the wiring diagram causes the menu to cover the wrong portion of the diagram. \n * After login to Business Space, a Log in button might be shown in the top right of the main page instead of a Log out button. (When this occurs, no spaces or pages are available to display, but selecting Log in allows login to proceed without prompting for user name and password, after which the appropriate space and page is displayed.) \n * With Internet Explorer 6 as the browser, changes to widget size are not persisted when changing pages or logging out. \n * When loading a page containing wires, some wires may not be active. \n * Some widget styles may be applied incorrectly depending on the order of items on the page. \n * If you create a new page while editing the current page, the current page is not saved correctly when you start the new page creation. \n * If you change pages while editing the current page, the current page is not saved correctly before the page change occurs, and the modified content replaces the content of the page you are switching to. \n * You might be prompted to save or undo changes when navigating away from a space with no change to it. \n * Java\u2122Script exceptions occur when using bi-directional locales. \n * Timing related issues might occur when loading a page with multiple widgets, where the iWidgets have the same resource file dependencies. \n * When the edit settings of the ScriptAdapter widget is selected for a second time during the same Business Space session, the dialog for the Script Adapter widgets settings does not display.\n\n\nOther operational issues:  * Accessibility support in the Business Space framework and Business Space common widgets is incomplete. \n * Business Space enforces HTTPS during logon. (In V7.0.0.2, this restriction has been removed.) \n * A benign exception message about Trust Association is written to SystemOut.log.\n\nPREREQUISITES\n \n\n * Please ensure that your WebSphere Business Monitor environment meets the system requirements documented at: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018594 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018594] \n * You must be at WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0. \n * Important: WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0 Fix Pack 2 includes an update for Business Space.

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Users entering character input in editable fields on other widgets are prevented from entering more data when the Daeja Viewer applet being loaded from the associated instance of IBM Content Navigator acquires focus and consumes all keyboard input instead. \n\nSYMPTOM\n(The same issue occurs for earlier releases of Case Manager which load the Daeja viewer from Workplace XT: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938]) \n\nOn both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer, a user updating an editable field in the Case (Work Item) Data widget on the Work Details page while a document is loading in the Daeja Viewer in the Viewer widget will find, at a certain point, that they are unable to enter more characters in the field they were editing. The keyboard input is consumed by the Daeja Viewer applet instead. The page and widget where the editable fields exist may vary, but all will suffer from the problem of losing focus to the Daeja Viewer when a document is being loaded.\n\nThis can occur when the Attachments widget is configured to automatically load an attachment as soon as the page loads, when the \"Open a document when the Work Details page is opened\" setting is configured. At the same time, the user starts editing a field while loading is still in progress.\n\nFor example, if a user is entering the character 'z' repeatedly in an editable field while a document is loading in the Daeja Viewer, they will find, at a certain point in the loading process, that they are unable to add more character input and that the 'z' is instead consumed by Daeja, causing the document there to Zoom.\n\nTo continue typing in the editable field, try one of the following steps: \n\n\n- For Microsoft Internet Explorer, the user can click back into the editable field, and it will immediately allow the user to continue editing.\n\n\n- For Mozilla Firefox, click anywhere else on the page, then click back into the editable field, before you continue editing. This is true regardless of whether the document is displayed in the viewer widget or in a separate window. This is an issue with Firefox and Java applets generally and not the result of Daeja or IBM software.\n\nThe primary issue here is not specific to Daeja but is rather the result of default Java applet loading behavior.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe problem is a result of default Java applet loading behavior as handled by supported browsers.\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe problem can occur on Case Client workstations (Windows), on both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9.\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIf you see the issues described in the Symptom section, Java applet loading behavior is the likely cause.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nThe issue can be resolved by editing the IBM Content Navigator file that is used to load the Daeja Viewer applet by both IBM Content Navigator and IBM Case Manager.\n\nIt is this file that passes in the startup parameters used/consumed by the Daeja Viewer applet when it loads from IBM Content Navigator.\n\nNOTE: Make sure to make a backup copy of the file you will be editing in the instructions below.\n\nThis file, named filenetViewer_properties.jsp, is typically deployed in the following location:\n\n\\navigator.ear\\navigator.war\\applets\n\nTo resolve the issue, use the text editor of your choice to add the following two (2) parameters to the file:\n\n<===\n...\nvar filenetViewerParameters = { \n// annotateEdit: \"true\",\n... \ninitial_focus: \"false\",\ninitialFocus: \"false\", \ntrace: \"false\",\ntraceNet: \"false\"\n};\n===>\n\nNOTE: After modifying the filenetViewer_properties.jsp, make sure it has a current timestamp (newer than any cached copies so the JSP compiler will pick it up), shut down WebSphere Application Server, clear the \\logs, \\temp, and \\wstemp folders under the WebSphere Application Server profile, restart WebSphere Application Server, and then clear your browser cache as well before testing.\n\nNOTE: After testing the above and verifying that the changes work to resolve the issue, make sure to apply the same changes to the installed copy of the filenetViewer_properties.jsp, file under your local equivalent of the following two directories:\n\n\\<ECMClient_INSTALL_HOME>\\configure\\explodedformat\\navigator\\applets\n\n\\<ECMClient_INSTALL_HOME>\\tmp\n\nEditing these copies of this files makes the change permanent so that you do not lose your changes the next time IBM Content Navigator is redeployed,\n\nNOTE: You will still need to reapply these changes each time you apply a new IBM Content Navigator fixpack since this file may be overwritten if the fixpack contains its own copy of this file.\n\nNOTE: The same issue occurs on earlier releases of IBM Case Manager where the Daeja Viewer applet loads from IBM Content Navigator instead of Workplace XT. See the related technote for Editable fields in other widgets lose focus when Daeja Viewer loads from Workplace XT in the Viewer widget at the following link: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938].\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Same issue with Workplace XT on ICM-500 -> 511 [www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938]",

It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. \n\nA) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. \n\nNOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). \nThe top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. \nThe official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. \n\n \n\nB) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] \n\nNo older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. \n\n \n\nC) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. \n\nFull documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. \n\n \n\nAlso, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.

If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22. Please see http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572] for download. \n\n**** \n\nF) Apple Macintosh OSX Mountain Lion (10.8) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n**** \n\nG) Apple Macintosh OSX Lion (10.7) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nH) Apple Macintosh OSX Snow Leopard (10.6) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nOlder SPSS Statistics releases 18 and 19 and 20: \n\nPlease note that SPSS Statistics releases 18, 19 and 20 are no longer supported by IBM.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n I am plannig to update to the new Apple Mac OS X, 10.10 Yosemite and would like to know if IBM SPSS Statistics will run successfully on this OS. \n\nCAUSE\nOS Update\n\nANSWER\nIBM SPSS Statistics (any version) has two issues to resolve before it will run on OS X 10.10: \n\n1. Download and re-install Apple Java 6\n\n- After the OS upgrade is finished, Apple Java 6 no longer exists on their system. \n- The first time the user runs an application that relies on Java 6, the OS pops up a dialog box stating they've requested Java 6, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided (http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]).\n- User must click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- User must open the Java DMG, then double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation.\n\n2. Re-license Statistics\n\n- We use Safenet Sentinel technology for licensing. Safenet writes hidden data somewhere on-disc for keeping track of licensing data.\n- The OS X 10.10 upgrade process erases that hidden data. Attempting to run Statistics produces a licensing error and Stats does not start/run properly.\n- Solution: Re-run the SPSS License Authorization Wizard, enter auth code again and complete licensing procedure.\n- Statistics will now run normally.\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

      "Mac OS X; Performance; open; close; exit; launch; 10.6.x 10.7.x 10.8.x 10.9.x TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n With SPSS Statistics 21 or 22 software installed on Mac OS X. \nThe software was running normally, but for what ever reason, the program might fail or close improperly by using Force Quit several times. \n\nCAUSE\nThis has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM90266\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThis technote applies with any Mac OS X compatible with Statistics 21 or 22, Not version 23. \n\n- IBM SPSS Statistics 21 release is supported on Apple Macintosh 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel processor. \n\n- IBM SPSS Statistics 22 release is supported on Apple Macintosh 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel processor. \nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Macintosh (Mavericks, OSX 10.9 Operating System) is not officially supported until Statistics 22 FixPack 1 is released. \n\n\nNote: Windows computers see \nTechnote 1652535\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652535 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652535]\n\nNote: For Statistics 23.0 Windows or Mac OS X, refer to technote: 1640411\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411]\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nOne or more of the following symptoms might occur that this resolution can solve. \n\n(1) Statistics takes an abnormally longer time to start and close than when the software was initially installed. \n\n(2) Very slow response and performance with using the software. \n\n(3) The 'Data Editor' menu no longer appears under the Main menu bar.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nDelete the following file: com.ibm.spss.plist on your Macintosh to dramatically reduce the opening and closing of the Statistics software. \n\n- You can delete it by opening the Finder and locate the Library/Preferences folder: /Library/Preferences/com.ibm.spss.plist\n(1) Restart your Mac.\n(2) Open 'Finder'.\n(3) Select the 'Home' (house) icon (folder) in the left-hand pane.\n(4) Select the 'Go' menu at top of screen.\n(5) Press the 'Option' key. The list of menu options will now include 'Library'.\n(6) Select the 'Library' menu option.\n(7) Open the 'Preferences' folder.\n(8) Rename the com.ibm.spss.plist object to old_com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n\n- Another option is to use the Terminal application and do the following:\nrm -fR ~/Library/Preferences/com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n \n\nFinish and test your changes by doing the following: \n\n(9) Launch Statistics\n(10) Work with the program a bit.\n(11) Close the software (It should be quicker, do not force quit)\n(12) Re-launch Statistics\n(13) Work with the program a bit.\n(14) Close the software (do not force quit)\n(15) Launch the software \n\n\nNOTE: When you launch Statistics for the first time, it will take a little longer than subsequent launches, until you reboot your computer again. This is related to Java initialization routines. \n\n\n- FYI: Additionally, if you are using Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.x, you need to stop the process that protects this file and restores it (it is deleted):\n\nSince OSX 10.9.x Mavericks a cached copy of your \"plist\" file is stored that uses a background process: CFPREFSD\nDeleting the \"plist\" file and restarting SPSS Statistics does not create a new copy of these files.\nRather, Mavericks restore its cached copy. \nOnly by stopping the \"cfprefsd\" process and starting SPSS Statistics, will it generate a new \"plist\" preference file and default toolbar.\n\nWhen you go to Finder - Applications - Utilities and open Activity Monitor on the 10.9.x computer you see that there is a CFPREFSD process visible for root user and for the current logged in user.\nYou need to stop the CFPREFSD process for the current user. Do so in the Terminal application by running the following command:\n\nkillall -u {CURRENT_USER} cfprefsd\n\nWhere {CURRENT_USER} is replaced with the person's user ID. One can get the user ID by typing \"whoami\" at a Terminal prompt. \n\nShould removing these files and running the program does not resolve the issue, you might need to remove all of them and reinstall the program.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n I have installed and licensed IBM SPSS Statistics on Macintosh 10.6.x and 10.7.x. However when I launch the program, I see the splash screen but then the actual program does not launch. The SPSS Statistics icon appears in the dock and is active but I do not see the Data Editor window. \n\nSYMPTOM\nSPSS Statistics displays splash screen when launched but does not load the actual program.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe most likely culprit is the local security software stopping SPSS Statistics from launching. Disable the virus checker/security software and see if SPSS will launch. If so, set an exclusion to the IBM SPSS Statistics folder for the virus checker/security software on launch. We have had reports of incompatibility with a program called Intego with its option Behavioral Analysis turned on. The virus barrier application may have to be disabled for Statistics to launch. \n\nIf this does not solve your issue, please open a case to technical support for troubleshooting.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

      "Coded Data TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n We scan different types of documents and store them in ImagePlus\u00ae. We use scanning workstations set up at 160 service centers. The scanning workstations have software to register the document in FAF and then store the image on the ODM host. The software executes on an OS/2\u00ae workstation using IWP/2 and customized software that communicates with the FAF and ODM hosts using CommMgr/2 and LU2 and LU 6.2 connectivity. One type of document is called a re-weigh ticket. As a shipment is unloaded it is automatically weighed as the tow motor lifts the skid from the trailer. If the declared weight on the bill of lading provided by the customer does not match the weight registered, a re-weigh ticket is filled out by the tow motor driver, scanned in the service center office, and the freight bill is corrected or adjusted. When we invoice the customer, we include a copy of the scanned bill of lading as well as any scanned re-weigh ticket. \n\nWe have begun to deploy tow motors that have PC software and infrared transponders. When the skid is lifted, the actual weight can be automatically captured and sent via infrared to a local PC server and then to our host. We would like to take the electronically captured weights and create a coded data object to simulate a real re-weigh ticket that was manually filled out and scanned. \n\n1. Where can I find documentation for our application programmers of the coded data object? \n2. Are there any FAF API modules that can be used to create coded data objects?\n3. Can coded data be created online? \n4. Where can I find documentation about the form overlay for the coded data? Will it print just as it is stored and are any samples available? \n5. Are there any required system settings and where are these documented? \n\nANSWER\nCoded Data objects are constructed using MO:DCA\u2122 (Mixed Object:Document Content Architecture\u2122) and PTOCA (Presentation Text Object Content Architecture). We use a subset of MO:DCA, which is known as MO:DCA-P. The two manuals that you would need for constructing Coded Data objects would be the MO:DCA Reference manual (SC31-6802) and the PTOCA Reference manual (SC31-6803). MO:DCA can be considered the outside wrapper of the document, while PTOCA describes the actual text on the page. The name of the form overlay (which we require to be 8 characters or less) appears in the MO:DCA structure. \n\n 1. There are no FAF API modules that construct coded data objects. You would need to create a custom application that takes the electronic data and wraps it with the appropriate PTOCA and MO:DCA tags. \n 2. If you mean 'Can we get the electronic data, wrap it in MO:DCA/PTOCA, and store it in real time', the answer is yes. You could store and index the information directly in IPFAF and IODM using the published APIs (in other words, you could use the IPFAF API STOREOBJ command, or the IODM Workstation APIs in conjunction with the IPFAF APIs, to store and index documents). The IPFAF APIs are documented in the Application Programmer's Guide for that product (SC31-7531), and the IODM APIs can be found in SC31-7541 (Workstation APIs) and SC31-7540 (Front-end Application APIs). \n 3. The form overlay itself is usually a MO:DCA image, so you should be able to view and print it as is. The usual method is to tell IWP \"I'm scanning a form,\" and then it knows to construct it in a certain fashion. You initiate this process by sending a STORAUTH request to IODM with OBJCLASS set to x'8020' and an 8 character or less form name. When the tempID is entered at the workstation, IODM tells IWP that \"this is a form.\" The IPFAF FWA and API applications do not support the indexing of form overlays, so you would need some sort of custom interface for this to IODM. There are no published samples available. \n 4. The difficulty with coded data is in setting up the IODM Collection exit to correctly determine the OAM collection name that was used to store the form overlays. When IODM gets a retrieval request for coded data objects, it looks at the MO:DCA wrapper of the object to determine what forms are needed. The MO:DCA wrapper contains only the names of the forms, but IODM needs the form name plus the OAM collection name in order to retrieve the forms. IODM must therefore rely on its collection name exit to get the correct OAM collection name. This exit is documented in the IODM System Programmer's Guide (SC31-7535). \n\n\n\nIf you plan on using ImagePlus Workstation Program Release 2.2 for Windows NT\u00ae, be sure to check with IWP Support for the latest fixes. If you are planning to use ImagePlus 3.1, the new Remote API feature could help with indexing and storage of the coded data objects, however you would still need to write the code that wraps your data into MO:DCA/PTOCA. The Remote API basically makes available on a Windows\u00ae 2000 or Windows XP machine, a subset of the IPFAF APIs and IODM Workstation APIs. You make a call to the API from the workstation, and it executes the function on the host system. The API uses TCP/IP as its communication protocol."

The information in this APAR will be added to each\n   guide as it is updated.  The task to update all CORBA probes\n   will conclude at the end of 2010.\n   ****************************************************************\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The following information will be added to all CORBA probes,\n   and will be supplemented by explanatory diagrams and, where\n   appropriate, details specific to the individual CORBA probe:\n   \n   Firewall considerations\n   =======================\n   When using CORBA probes in conjunction with a firewall, the\n   firewall must be configured in such a that allows the probe to\n   connect to the third party system.\n   \n   If the probe or target system are installed behind, in front\n   of, or on both sides of a firewall, then the firewall needs to\n   be configured to let communication through on certain ports\n   between certain servers.\n   \n   This entails adding the appropriate firewall rules that allow\n   the probe to connect to the target system outside the firewall.\n   \n   The following firewall protection scenarios may occur:\n   * Only Host 1 is behind a firewall\n   * Only Host 2 is behind a firewall\n   * Both Host 1 and Host 2 is secured by its own firewall\n   \n   where:\n   Host 1 is the host on which the probe is running.\n   Host 2 is the host on which the target system is running.\n   \n   \n   Configuring probes to run with a firewall\n   =========================================\n   The nature of the connection between the probe and the third\n   party system is determined by whether the probe is acting as a\n   server or as a client. If the probe is acting as a client, it\n   connects to third party system; if the probe is acting as a\n   server, it listens on a port to which the third party system\n   connects.\n   \n   When configuring the system, you need to consider the remote\n   host and port to which the probe will connect, or the incoming\n   port number on which the probe will listen and to which third\n   party system will connect.\n   \n   When running in a two firewall configuration, you must consider\n   the outgoing port(s) that the probe uses, so that they are\n   opened on the probe's host firewall.  These ports will be\n   different from the target port that must be opened on the target\n   host which can be seen in the probe's properties file.\n   \n   For CORBA probes, those that use EventManager or\n   NotificationManager objects may use different hosts and ports\n   from those that than NamingService and EntryPoint hosts and\n   ports. So if probe is configured to get object references from a\n   NamingService or an EntryPoint, you must know which host and\n   port is used by the requested object. To obtain this\n   information, you must contact the system administrator of the\n   target system admininstration.\n   \n   Based on the connection's details, the firewall administrator\n   must add the appropriate firewall rules.\n   \n   \n   Connection information for CORBA probes\n   =======================================\n   Most CORBA probes use two-way communication, meaning that the\n   CORBA probe can connect to the target system, and can listen\n   for connections from the target system.\n   \n   The firewall system administrator must open up the firewall by\n   adding firewall rules to allow this two-way\n   connection/communication.\n   \n   When running in a two firewall configuration, you must\n   determine the following four ports before adding the firewall\n   rules:\n   \n   1. The outgoing port/port range for probe.\n   \n   2. The hostname and port of the remote third party system.\n   \n   3. The outgoing port to which the third party system sends\n   events if the probe is running as a client and is expecting data\n   on a port on the probe host.\n   \n   4. The incoming port to which the probe listens for incoming\n   events. Most, but not all, CORBA probes listen on the port\n   specified by the ORBLocalPort property defined in the probe's\n   properties file. The default value for this property is 0,\n   which means the incoming port number is dynamic. If the probe is\n   under firewall protection, the ORBLocalPort property must be\n   specified as a fixed port number.\n   \n   Having determined these ports, the firewall administrator must\n   add firewall rules to allow the various connections between the\n   probe and the third party system.\n   \n   \n   Running multiple probes in a failover configuration\n   ===================================================\n   You can run multiple instances of a probe. For each running\n   instance, you must specify a different port to which the probe\n   listens using the ORBLocalPort property.\n   \n   If there are two probes running simultaneously (a master probe\n   and a slave), each probe has its own ORBLocalPort, so\n   receiving port of each probe must be added to the firewall\n   rules. The direction of the connection will be from the target\n   system to the master/slave probe.\n   \n   If you are running a master and a slave probe, take note of the\n   following property settings:\n   \n   In the master probe properties file, set the properties as\n   follows:\n   PeerHost : \"master_hostname\"\n   PeerPort : 5555 # [communication port between master and slave\n   probes]\n   \n   In the slave probe properties file, set the properties as\n   follows:\n   PeerHost : \"slave_hostname\"\n   PeerPort : 5555 # [communication port between master and slave\n   probes]\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IZ74516\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   HUAWEI T2000 CO\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724P16HT\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   100\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED DOC\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2010-04-13\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2010-06-30\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2010-06-30\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS",

You must upgrade to 3.X before upgrading to 4.X. We recommend upgrading to the latest 3.0.1 fixpack before the upgrade 4.X. \n\nUpgrading from RTC3.0 or CLM 3.0.1.x to CLM 4.x \n\nIn addition to the Interactive Upgrade Guide for CLM 4.X [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_form.html], there is the CLM 2012 Upgrade Guide [https://jazz.net/library/article/819], which contains important information, including a Frequently Asked Questions section. \n\nWith CLM 4.X/CLM 2012, workitems related to CLM upgrades are captured in workaround articles which you can find in these locations: \n\nhttps://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-team-concert [https://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-team-concert] \n\nhttps://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-quality-manager [https://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-quality-manager] \n\nhttps://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-requirements- [https://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=rational-requirements-composer]composer [https://jazz.net/library/] \n\nhttps://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=jazz-foundation [https://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,4.0&project=jazz-foundation] \n\nhttps://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,2.0&project=rrdi [https://jazz.net/library/#q=&tag=workaround,2.0&project=rrdi] \n\n \n\nUpgrading from CLM 2.X, RTC 3.0 or CLM 3.0.1 to CLM 3.0.1.x \n\nIn addition to the planning and Interactive Upgrade Guide support for upgrading from CLM 2.X releases in the InfoCenter [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_overview.html], there is a specific section for upgrading from 3.X to 3.0.1 and fixpacks [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.jazz.install.doc%2Ftopics%2Ft_upgrading_3011.html].\n\nIf you are using RRDI, you must also update the RRDI Report Templates. See the \"Upgrading reporting artifacts [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_reporting_artifacts.html]' topic in the CLM 3.0.1 infocenter for how [https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/CALMReportingSetup] to do this update. \n\nThere are additional articles for planning upgrades from CLM 2.X on Jazz.net.

      " TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nPROBLEM\nIf steps were not taken PRIOR to the IBM i 7.3 upgrade to switch the JDK to 7.0 or later for your Websphere Application Server (WAS) v8.5 environment, it will not function after the OS upgrade is completed, due to JDK 6.0 no longer being available at IBM i 7.3. This document demonstrates what changes need to be made to allow your WAS v8.5 environment to function again.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn order to determine how to resolve this issue, we first need to find what version of Websphere Application Server v8.5 is currently installed on the system.

This is due to the following:\n1. Jazz for Service Management is installed as a non-root user\n2. Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. \n\n\nThe script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.\n\nUsage: ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"IM_Install_Location\" \n\"JazzSM_Install_Location [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/ref/psc_r_pathnames.html]\"\"[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]\"\n\nFor example (showing default installation paths): ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"/home/root/IBM/InstallManager/\" \"/opt/IBM/JazzSM/\" \"/opt/Download/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml\"\n\n\nFor IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. \nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.\n\nFor IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.\nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.\n\nJazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=2]JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=1]"

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When you search for a user within the 'Manage Group' in the Process Admin Console for IBM Business Process Manager, a more specific search keyword does not result in any entries. In addition, an LDAP timeout message is added to the SystemOut.log file. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen you do a broad search with a small keyword, you expect to receive many entries in return. When your search is more specific, you use a longer keyword to try to narrow the search. However, when you expect fewer returns from your search, it does not happen. The user list remains empty. \n\nYou can find the following exception in the SystemOut.log file:\n\n[8/7/12 14:02:59:435 CEST] 000000xx exception E com.ibm.ws.wim. \nadapter.ldap.LdapConnection search(String, String, Object[], \nSearchControls) CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.NamingException: LDAP \nresponse read timed out, timeout used:20000ms.; Remaining name: \n'DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=com'; Resolved object: 'com.sun.jndi. \nldap.LdapCtx@196fbd6a'' naming exception occurred during processing. \n[8/7/12 14:02:59:435 CEST] 00000068 exception E com.ibm.ws.wim. \nadapter.ldap.LdapConnection search(String, String, Object[], \nSearchControls) \ncom.ibm.websphere.wim.exception. \nWIMSystemException: CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.NamingException: LDAP \nresponse read timed out, timeout used:20000ms.; Remaining name: \n'DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=com'; Resolved object: 'com.sun.jndi. \nldap.LdapCtx@196fbd6a'' naming exception occurred during processing. \nat com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection.search \n(LdapConnection.java:2951) \nat com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection.checkSearchCache \n(LdapConnection.java:2781) \nat com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection.search \n(LdapConnection.java:2971) \n...\n\n\nCAUSE\nIn some cases, LDAP might take longer to respond on a more specific search, which results in an LDAP timeout. \n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo resolve this issue, increase the LDAP timeout limit by using one of the following options: \n\n \n\n * Option 1 \n   Use the wsadmin command:\n   $AdminTask updateIdMgrLDAPServer {-id AD -connectTimeout 0} \n   $AdminConfig save \n   \n   \n   After it is saved, view the wimconfig.xml file and make sure you see connectTimeout=\"0\" \n   \n   \n   You can find the wimconfig.xml file in the following locations in the deployment manager configuration:  * {WAS_HOME}\\profiles\\profile_name\\config\\cells\\cell_name\\wim\\config\\wimconfig.xml\n      \n      \n    * profile_root/conf/cells/cell_name/wim/config/wimconfig.xml\n   \n   \n   \n   A complete restart of the WebSphere Application Server / IBM Business Process Manager environment is required to make this change take effect.\n   \n   \n * Option 2 \n   You will edit the wimconfig.xml file directly. However, before you edit the file, make a backup copy of it. Edit the wimconfig.xml file and search forconnectTimeout. Change this value from connectTimeout=\"20\" to connectTimeout=\"0\" and save the file. \n   \n   \n   A complete restart of the WebSphere Application Server / IBM Business Process Manager environment is required to make this change take effect.\n\n\nNote: The connectTimeout increment value is in seconds of time.

      "JDBC Adapter fixpack; 6.0.2.3; WebSphere JDBC; WebSphere adapter for JDBC; fix pack; 6.0.2.3; 6023 DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n WebSphere\u00ae Adapter for JDBC version 6.0.2 has been updated. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\n\nWebSphere Adapter for JDBC fix pack version 6.0.2.3\n\nInternal tracking number 90872/JR27717: Adapter for JDBC generates a ConnectionObjectClosed error with data sources after the database goes down. \n\n\nSymptom: When the adapter is configured to use a predefined data source and the database system goes down while the adapter is processing the requests, the adapter fails to recover the connection after the database system is restarted. \nResolution: The adapter now generates a connection error event for the stale managed connection, which is then removed from the managed connection pool. Subsequent requests are processed successfully. \n\nInternal tracking number 90821 : Event logging fails when an adapter from version 6.0.2 is started using WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, version 6.1 or WebSphere Process Server, version 6.1. \nSymptom: The adapter generated an org.eclipse.hyades.logging.events.cbe.MissingPropertyException error whenever event logging was enabled. \nResolution: The event logging service in WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus and WebSphere Process Server was modified in version 6.1 and now requires additional input parameters. The WebSphere Adapters code has been updated to provide these parameters so that events are logged successfully. \n\nInternal tracking number 90722/JR27593: Time zone differences between the WebSphere Application Server logs and adapter log files \nSymptom: The time zone format in the log files generated by the adapter does not match the time zone format in the WebSphere Application Server log files. \nResolution: The time zone format has been modified in the adapter to match the time zone format in the WebSphere Application Server log files. The adapter will log the messages in local time zone dateFormat=yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:SSS zzz. \n\nInternal tracking number 70276 : UnknownSQLType error with int type in DB2\u00ae \nSymptom: During inbound processing, the adapter generates an UnknownSQLType error message while processing an event for a business object with attributes of type int. \nResolution: The adapter correctly processes business objects with int datatypes. \n\nInternal tracking number 89830 : UnknownSQLType: -99999 \nSymptom: During outbound processing, the adapter generates an UnknownSQLType error message while processing a business object containing attributes with primitive datatypes. \nResolution: The adapter correctly processes business objects with primitive datatypes. \n\nInternal tracking number 90339 : Connection leakage during rollback of a transaction for event delivery Symptom: After delivering the event to the endpoint, the adapter updates the status of the event in the event table. When the event has been successfully delivered, commit is called and the event is marked as delivered. However, if the adapter fails to update the event status, it generates an XAException error with error code XA_RETRY. In this case, transaction manager keeps retrying the commit on all participants in the global transaction and every retry results in a new connection being created in the connection pool. Eventually, the connection pool will be exhausted, resulting in connection timeout issues. \n\nNow, if the event delivery fails, rollback is called and the event is marked as new and ready to poll again. If any of these operations fails, the transaction is rolled back, which might result in a connection leak. The operations to update the event status and mark the event as new are likely to fail due to data related issues or to an external application modifying the data in the event table. Also, this problem occurs only when Adapter for JDBC is configured to use data source JNDI. \nResolution: Fixed. \n\nInternal tracking number 90074: ExhaustedResultSet error \nSymptom: After delivering the event to the endpoint, the adapter updates the status of the event in the event table. However, if the event has been externally deleted from the event table, the adapter generates an ExhaustedResultSet error. \nResolution: The adapter no longer generates the error. \n\nInternal tracking number 89285 : Filter future events feature is not working for the adapter\nSymptom: When the FilterFutureEvents property is set to true and an event is polled, the following resource exception is generated, \"javax.resource.ResourceException: Event timestamp is null.\" \nResolution: The resource exception is no longer generated when the filter future events feature is used. \n\nInternal tracking number 89548/JR27115: Adapter for JDBC trims space from object_key \nSymptom: During inbound event delivery, the adapter trims space from object_key before retrieving the object based on the object key specified in the event table. \nResolution: The adapter provides an additional Boolean property (performTrimOnObjectKeyValue) on the ActivationSpec. The value set on this property determines whether the adapter trims the value set on object_key or not. The default value for this property is true, which means that by default, the adapter will trim the value set on the object_key. If you do not want the adapter to trim the spaces in object_key, set this property to false. \n\nInternal tracking number 89357 : The adapter does not terminate normally \nSymptom: The adapter does not roll back failed global transactions during inbound event delivery, so the WebSphere Application Server transaction manager keeps retrying the transactions. \nResolution: The adapter rolls back the transactions in the case of a failure. \n\nInternal tracking number 89356 : Database Lock after transaction rollback \nSymptom: The adapter does not roll back failed global transactions during inbound event delivery. You might see the following messages in the trace file: \n1. Limit for number of MessageEndpoint proxies created reached. \n2. TimeoutManager I WTRN0006W: Transaction \"TRANSACTION_ID\" has timed out after 200 seconds. 3. SQLException: distributed transaction waiting for lock This message is specific for the Oracle database; however, you will likely see a similar message for other databases as well. \nResolution: The adapter rolls back the transactions in the case of failure. \n\n \n\nEnhancements in version 6.0.2.2\n\nInternal tracking number 72741: Enterprise service discovery wizard is enabled for all manual application-specific information editing.\n\nEnterprise service discovery wizard can build a hierarchy of both multiple and single cardinality child business objects, including KeepRelationship, Ownership, and Required application-specific information by getting user input and setting foreign keys appropriately in the parent and child business objects.\n\nInternal tracking number 72810: A new property, DriverConnectionProperties, has been added.\nThe new property has been added to the managed connection factory and activation specification.\n\nInternal tracking number 60808: Prepared statement caching is supported. \nThe adapter now supports prepared statement caching. This feature is available only if a data source is used to connect to the database. \n\nInternal tracking number 72815: Support is needed for generating appropriate application-specific information for globalized data types.\n\nSupport for the following globalized data types is now provided: NCHAR, NVARCHAR, NTEXT, TEXT, RAW, MONEY, and SMALLMONEY.\n\nInternal tracking number 72805: Support for wrapper business objects has been added.\nSupport is provided for the construction of wrapper business objects in the Enterprise Metadata Discovery.\n\nInternal tracking number 68834: The enterprise service discovery wizard displays stored procedure (SP) names as SPName (PkgName).\n\nStored procedures are now displayed in the enterprise service discovery wizard as SPName (PackageName), sorted by SPName. For example, if package A includes one stored procedure called DSP, and package B includes another stored procedure called CSP, the enterprise service discovery wizard displays these two stored procedures in the following order: CSP(B) DSP(A). \n\nInternal tracking number 86355: Equivalent support of the WebSphere Business Integration Adapter application-specific information, UNVL, is needed in the JCA adapter. UNVL equivalent support is now provided.\n\n\nFixes in version 6.0.2.2:\n\nInternal tracking number 87658/APAR JR26244: Trigger usage with MS SQL Server 2000 returns the wrong User Identity (UID).\n\nWith MS SQL Server 2000, when a row is inserted into a table, for instance \"customer,\" a trigger is executed and a row is added to the event table. Both tables use the Identity column as the primary key. For further processing, the UID of the inserted \"customer\" row should be retrieved, but the adapter retrieves the UID of the row inserted into the event table instead. This has been fixed and the adapter returns the correct UID. \n\nInternal tracking number 87349/APAR JR26243: The Update operation on a business object with n-cardinality children creates the last child business object only if it is not there already. This has been fixed and the adapter appropriately processes the n-cardinality children.\n\nInternal tracking number 88947/ APAR JR26628: The adapter retrieves incorrect data for child objects when a parent business object contains two single cardinality children with foreign keys referring to the same attribute. This has been fixed, and the adapter correctly retrieves the data for single cardinality children. \n\nInternal tracking number 89008: With some requests, the adapter generates the SQLException \"maximum open cursors exceeded\" after retrieving data from an Oracle database. This problem has been fixed and the adapter is closing the open resultset and statement objects.\n\nInternal tracking number 69773: The adapter generates a NullPointerException exception when using the Custom delete query for an inbound operation. This has been fixed and the adapter appropriately processes the Custom delete query.\n\nFixes in version 6.0.2.1:\n\nInternal tracking number 69043: Unable to connect to a database using XADataSourceName and XADatabaseName properties configured in the managed connection factory. This has been fixed and the adapter can connect to the database when configured with these properties.\n\nInternal tracking number 87193: The execute operation on the stored procedure fails when the stored procedure has IN OUT (IO) parameters. This has been fixed for data types other than CLOB and BLOB. For details about CLOB and BLOB support, refer to the JDBC adapter technotes.\n\nInternal tracking number 87159: The adapter generates a ClassCastException exception for binary types within a stored procedure. This has been fixed and binary data types are handled correctly.\n\nInternal tracking number 87216: When returning BLOB data, the adapter returns the length of the BLOB data instead of the content of the BLOB data. This has been fixed and adapter now returns the content of BLOB data.\n\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\nThis fix pack should be installed on Version 6.0.2 of WebSphere Adapter for JDBC.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nNote: If you are using WebSphere Integration Developer, upgrade the adapter using WebSphere Integration Developer 602 (with the latest interim fix).\n\nInstall the fix by following these instructions:\n\n1. Download the file for your operating system. \n2. Unzip the archive to a temporary location.\n3. Run the appropriate setup file for the operating system and install it to the same folder that contains the RAR file from the 6.0.2 version of the adapter. \n\nTo deploy adapters on AIX\u00ae, HP-UX, and Solaris platforms, generate new EAR files from the updated RAR file after applying the fix pack, using the enterprise service discovery wizard available with WebSphere Integration Developer on Windows\u00ae or Linux\u00ae platforms. The new EAR file can then be deployed to WebSphere Process Server on the respective platform.\n\nFor more setup information, follow the detailed instructions in the Adapter for JDBC ReadMe.htm file within the fix pack.\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options JDBC FP 6.0.2.3 for Windows 12/15/2007 English 104426339 FTP [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/ts/cw/adapters/WSAdapterForJDBC/websphereadapterforjdbc_6.0.2.3_WIN.zip] JDBC FP 6.0.2.3 for Linux 12/15/2007 English 109159170 FTP [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/ts/cw/adapters/WSAdapterForJDBC/websphereadapterforjdbc_6.0.2.3_LINUX.zip]"

If the mime type of the document as shown in system properties in ICN is not text/csv, then Navigator cannot recognize the document and a .dat extension will be added upon download. The correct mime type for a CSV file is text/csv. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf there are CSV document already in the content repository with a mime type that is not text/csv, then in order to view them in a text editor (ex. Notepad), you may use the following workaround:\n- save the document to the local machine with .dat extension\n- right click on the .dat file and click Open With... \n- click 'Choose your default program...'\n- then select Notepad or another text editor of your choice\n- select the checkbox 'Always use the selected program to open this type of file'\n\nThe other alternative is to change the mimetype of the document in the content repository using a custom solution written using the repository's client APIs.",

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Common Errors and Resolutions when importing Job Code Default Data (JCDD) via Workbench. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nERROR CAUSE/RESOLUTION [Field Name]: Codes must contain alphanumeric characters. The only permitted non-alphanumeric characters are dash (-) and underscore (_). A code may not start with a dash (-). CAUSE: The field contains an invalid character. Only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores are allowed.\nRESOLUTION: Remove any non-alphanumeric characters (except for dashes and underscores) from that field. [Field Name] is not a valid value CAUSE: The option provided for the field does not exist in the option list. \nRESOLUTION: Add the option to the field\u2019s option list and re-import your spreadsheet. [Field] Input string was not in a correct format.. CAUSE: The data entered for the field does not match the field type. \nRESOLUTION: Review what was entered for the field and confirm that it matches the field\u2019s field type. For example, if the field is a numeric field but you have entered a special character ($, #, etc) with numeric characters, or if you have added alphabetic characters. Remove any characters that do not match the field\u2019s field type restrictions. Approval [Approval group name] is not a valid value. CAUSE: The Approval Group listed is not valid. \nRESOLUTION: Check that the Approval Group exists and is spelled correctly. Note: Exporting out JCDD may automatically add a \u201cDefaultreqnoselection\u201d value in the approval groups columns if no default has been set up for that job code. To resolve this issue, clear this value from the rows and re-import. [Option] is not a legal value for WorkLocation (English (US)). CAUSE: The option provided for the field does not exist in the option list. \nRESOLUTION: Add the option to the field\u2019s option list and re-import your spreadsheet. External table is not in the expected format CAUSE: The file that is attempting to be loaded is not in the proper format.\nRESOLUTION: Go back to your file format. Compare your file with a file just exported from Workbench, reviewing the tab names to ensure accuracy and the column headers on the Defaults tab. If no differences are found, it is recommended to copy and paste your information into a new spreadsheet and attempt the import again. If that does not work, save your Excel spreadsheet as an \".xlsx\" doc then manually go into your files and edit the name, removing the \"x\" to make it \".xls\", then import again. Form specified does not match the import profile CAUSE: There is unsupported HTML tags in a field within your spreadsheet.\nRESOLUTION: Remove any unsupported HTML in the Job Description field. The conversion of a nvarchar data type to a datetime data type resulted in an out-of-range value. The statement has been terminated. CAUSE: Date format is incorrect.\nRESOLUTION: Review your date fields and ensure that the format is correct (MM/DD/YYYY) Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from character string. CAUSE: Date format is incorrect.\nRESOLUTION: Review your date fields and ensure that the format is correct (MM/DD/YYYY) No. of Positions must be a whole number. CAUSE: The No. of Positions field has something other than a numerical value.\nRESOLUTION: Update the No. of Positions field on the spreadsheet to include only numerical values. ['Defaults$' OR 'Properties$'] is not a valid name. Make sure that it does not include invalid characters or punctuation and that it is not too long. CAUSE: The file is missing the appropriate tab(s) or the tab(s) are not labeled properly.\nRESOLUTION: The file must have 2 tabs, a Properties tab and a Defaults tab. Make sure that your spreadsheet has these tabs and they are appropriately labeled. Property \u2018client' does not match the import file CAUSE: On the Properties tab, the client name entered is not correct.\nRESOLUTION: On the Properties tab, correct the spelling or format of the client name. Exporting the current JCDD and keeping the Properties tab as-is will prevent this error from occurring. [Field] cannot contain restricted ASCII characters CAUSE: The field indictated in the error contains ASCII characters; which must be removed.\nRESOLUTION: The field must be updated to remove the ASCII characters. (ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an computer action of some sort.) You can attempt to copy/paste into a notepad to remove the characters and then paste into the spreadsheet. Manually removing the characters may also work if you are aware of the characters causing the error. Object reference not set to an instance of an object. CAUSE: Typically, this error results from system issues, not related to your import/export.\nRESOLUTION: We recommend waiting 5-15 minutes and trying the import/export again. Error converting data type varchar to int. CAUSE: Field Headers are missing in the spreadsheet.\nRESOLUTION: When uploading the JCDD spreadsheet your column headers (containing field names) must match exactly to what is exported originally from Workbench. The first way to resolve this is to match the column headers that are being imported to what is exported from Workbench. Another way to resolve this is to use the \u201cOverwrite All\u201d option on the mapping page. This will bypass the matching column header requirement (skipping the unmatched columns). more than one record matched criteria. CAUSE: Multiple records exist for this one Job Code. By exporting the full JCDD list you will see that there are multiple lines for this one Job Code.\nRESOLUTION: Please put a ticket in with the Global Support Center. IBM engineering will have to delete/remove the duplicate data for that Job Code. \n\n\nJUMP TO: TOPIC LINK Table of Contents Click Here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988845] Preparing the JCDD Spreadsheet for Import into Workbench Click Here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988813] Performing the JCDD Import (Power User Access) Click Here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988811] Performing the JCDD Import (Tier 5 User Access) Click Here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988812] Reading the JCDD Results File Click Here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988809] \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Smarter Workforce BrassRing on Cloud Smarter Workforce IBM Kenexa BrassRing on Cloud",

      "TAI; trust association interceptor; ESM; order; interface; authentication; security TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\nCan you specify the order in which WebSphere Application Server calls trust association interceptors?\n\nCAUSE\nWebSphere Application Server does not provide such functionality.\n\nANSWER\nWebSphere Application Server (WAS) provides no means of specifying the order in which trust association interceptors (TAI) are called. WAS calls a TAI's isTargetInterceptor method, and if the TAI indicates that it can service a given request, WAS then calls that TAI's negotiateValidateandEstablishTrust method. If negotiateValidateandEstablishTrust fails to authenticate the request, WAS will not call any other TAIs' isTargetInterceptor. In other words, WAS's processing goes something like:\n\nTAI.A.isTargetInterceptor -> false\nTAI.B.isTargetInterceptor -> true\nTAI.B.negotiateValidateandEstablishTrust -> authentication fails\nTAI.C.isTargetInterceptor (never called)\n\nor:\n\nTAI.C.isTargetInterceptor -> true\nTAI.C.negotiateValidateandEstablishTrust -> authentication succeeds\nTAI.A.isTargetInterceptor (never called)\nTAI.B.isTargetInterceptor (never called)\n\nNotice that WAS may call the TAIs' isTargetInterceptor methods in different orders - WAS offers no guarantees in this regard.

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The ability to launch and display Java applets (also known as plug-ins) in a browser depends on the presence of the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI). As of Chrome 42, NPAPI is disabled by default. Therefore, web applications which use Java applets will have reduced functionality. Firefox will end NPAPI support by the end of 2016. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen using browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, any functionality which depends on launching a Java applet such as the ViewONE Professional or the Content Manager applet viewer in IBM Content Navigator is unavailable.\n\n\nCAUSE\nSupport for NPAPI has ended or will come to an end. \n\nGoogle Chrome does not support NPAPI:\nhttps://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation [https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation]\n\nMozilla Firefox support for NPAPI ends at the end of 2016:\nhttps://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/10/08/npapi-plugins-in-firefox/ [https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/10/08/npapi-plugins-in-firefox/]\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer has limited NPAPI support through Active X controls.

The garbled characters are not in the\nevents themselves. \n\nSince these messages might occur when the agent is processing\na directory listing in order to determine the current file\nto monitor as a result of a wildcard character in the \nRegexLogSources parameter, if the <filename> that results \nin this error is a file that should be monitored, then events\nwould be lost as the file is not monitored. The <filename> \nis in the directory for RegexLogSources. The additional \ninvalid characters are not seen in the file listing on the\nsystem. \n\nThis was discovered on Log File Agent V6.3 and later on \nWindows, but also occurs on UNIX. \n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following \ntrace enabled: \"ERROR (UNIT:kum0regx ALL)\", the agent RAS1\nlog <hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log\nshows trace points similar to the following with some extra\ncharacters added \".lnk\": \n----- \n...:kum0regx.c,286,\"KUM0_IsRegExPatternMatch\") \n*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 failed for string \u00e4\u00ab\u00e4\u00a8\u00e4O\u00e4\u00e8\u00e4\u00ec\u00e4j\u00e4\u00ec - \n\u00e4n\u00e4f\u00e4\u00ee\u00e4n .lnk\u00d9l \u00d9s\u00d9w pRegEx @4D05810 status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND> \n--- \n\nAPAR: IV79204\nAbstract: LOGS RE-READ FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVING\nTIME (DST) ENDS\nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when daylight saving\ntime ends, log files might be re-read from the beginning\nresulting in old events being re-sent. This only occurs \nwhen time is set back. \n\nThe agent falsely detects that the configuration (.conf) \nand format (.fmt) file have changed when the system is\nconfigured to \"Automatically adjust clock for Daylight \nSaving time\" and the file timestamps automatically change \ntriggering an agent reset. When NumEventsToCatchUp is set\nto -1, this series of events causes the log file to be\nre-read from the beginning. This was seen with IF0003 and\nIF0004 when monitoring log files on Windows operating \nsystems, but not with the Windows Event log. This problem\ndid not occur on UNIX systems. \n\nTo resolve this issue you must install and use the Windows\nWIX64 (x86-64 bit) agent or specify NumEventsToCatchUp=-2\nin the configuration file as a work-around. \n\nAPAR: IV77403\nAbstract: WINDOWS EVENT LOG EVENTS ARRIVED DELAYED WHEN \nNUMEVENTSTOCATCHUP IS USED \nAdditional information: With a large input load (for example,\n8004 events on each of 4 threads), Windows Event Log events\narrive with a significant delay when NumEventsToCatchUp=-1\nis set in the conf file. The delay increases as the event\nbacklog grows. It can be in the order of 5 minutes depending\non CPU, etc. This is a result of the inherent overhead in\nmaintaing the position (bookmark) in the Windows Event Log\nwhen NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1 or n. \n\nThis is a follow-on to APAR IV63704. \n\nAPAR: IV76731\nAbstract: UNABLE TO RENAME FILE WHICH IS BEING MONITORED BY ITM\nLOG FILE AGENT \nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when the agent is\nmonitoring an application log, the log file cannot be \nrenamed because the file is open or in use. When new\nrecords are added to the log, the agent opens the log, \nreads the log and closes the log. However, when a large\nvolume of events are written to the log file, the log file\nmay remain open or in use due to operating system\nefficiencies. As a result, an attempt to rename the log \nfile may fail. This problem occurs more prevently with the\nWINNT 32-bit agent, when NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1.\n\nTo minimize occurrence of this issue, use the Windows (WIX64) \nx86-64 bit Log File agent. \n\nAPAR: IV60331\nAbstract: RESETTING OF MULTIPLE CONF/FORMAT FILES CAUSES A CRASH\nAdditional information: Updating multiple configuration (.conf) \nor format (.fmt) files, usually via a script or a situation \nthat runs frequently, and causes the agent to reset might \nresult in a core or crash. This also might be more likely \nto occur with multiple subnodes to monitor a large number\nof files, for example, 100 files. The root cause of the\ncrash is closing a file which is already closed or no longer\nexists. \n\nThis has been seen, mainly on Linux, on agent start-up,\nshutdown or reset as a result of configuration file changes. \nThe problem was originally discovered in Log File Agent \nv6.2.3.1.\n\nThe <hostname>_lo_<#########>.log might contain information\nsimilar to the following: \n\n*** glibc detected *** /opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/bin/kloagent: \ndouble free \nor corruption (out): 0x00007f222d727030 *** \n======= Backtrace: ========= \n/lib64/libc.so.6[0x3c158760e6] \n/lib64/libc.so.6[0x3c15878c13] \n/lib64/libc.so.6(fclose+0x14d)[0x3c1586674d] \n/opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/lib/libkloudp.so(kum_fclose+0x97)[0x7f222 \n42a68db] \n/opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/lib/libkloudp.so(KUMP_ReleaseIOResources+ \n0x430)[0x7f2224275444] \n/opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/lib/libkloudp.so(KUMP_ReleaseSourceResour \nce+0xae1)[0x7f22242799d1] \n/opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/lib/libkloudp.so(KUMP_FileServer+0x7114)[ \n0x7f2224250f30] \n/opt/IBM/ITM/lx8266/lo/lib/libkloudp.so(+0xb9b56)[0x7f222427fb56 \n] \n/lib64/libpthread.so.0[0x3c16007851] \n/lib64/libc.so.6(clone+0x6d)[0x3c158e890d] \n. . . \n\n2.2 Defects\n--------------\nNone.\n\n2.3 Enhancements \n----------------------\nEnhancement: IV77403, IV76731\nAbstract: Add Support for Windows x86-64 bit (WIX64) Agent\nAdditional Information: Support was added for Windows x86-64 bit\n(WIX64) agent.

If only\nthe reset process (step a) is triggered, it also continues to \nfunction properly. \nNote: When the file is re-discovered after it is restored, it \nis read from the beginning as a new file. This is not new \nbehavior with this APAR. \n\nThe root cause of this problem occurs on LFA v6.3, but the log \nfile is monitored when the file is restored. \n\nAPAR: IV37051\nAbstract: EVENTS INTERMITTENTLY NOT MATCHED WHEN LINE WRITTEN IN\nPIECES\nAdditional information: When an application writes only part of the\nline and later writes the remainder of the line, the line\nintermittently matches as an event with no changes to the fmt\nfile. This occurs more prevalently on Windows systems because\nthe operating system notifies the agent when the file has\nchanged. When the first part of the line is written, the agent\nis notified but the partial line does not match any formats.\nWhen the second part of the line is written, the agent is\nnotified again but the remainder of the line does not match\nany formats. The two pieces of the line are treated as two\nlines, neither of which match and both pieces are written as\ntwo lines to the UnmatchLog, if one is configured. \n\nDefect: 207998\nAbstract: Agent does not continue to retry on remote log, when \nRC -3, because errno is zero.\nAdditional information: When monitoring remote log files where the\nconnection breaks; for example, the remote system shuts down\nor a network outage, the agent does not continually try\nto re-establish the connection.

Please refer to this matrix for the latest \ncertification information.\nPlease refer to the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)\nfor the latest operating system certification information:\nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html]\n\n3.1 Prerequisites for this fix\n--------------------------------\nThe prerequisite level for this fix is as follows:\n- IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2: Fix Pack 02 or higher\n(6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0002)\n\nThis fix pack is a complete install image and as such, can be \ninstalled on a pristine system. This fix is also cumulative, and can \nbe installed on any fix level for this version, release, and mod \nlevel above the prerequisite. \n\nFor details, see the Troubleshooting Wiki:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Monitoring/page/Log%20File%20Agent [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Monitoring/page/Log%20File%20Agent]\n\n4.0 Image directory contents\n===================\nThis fix image contains the following files:\n\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.README\n\n5.0 Installation instructions \n==================\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-------------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites\nfor this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment \nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME \n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n- NOTE: Before installing the LO x86-64 bit agent, you must\nun-install the WINNT 32-bit version of the agent and the 32/64 \nbit compatibility package.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\nFor installation instructions, see the Log File Agent User's Guide\nv6.3.0: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en]\n\nNote: \n1. The PowerPC little-endian installation image is located in the\nPPC_LE directory of the installation image. Invoke ./install.sh\nfrom this directory.\n\n2. On Windows systems, when the installation completes, the \nReadme.txt displays \"Welcome to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Fix\nPack 5.\" This is the installer level and Readme and is not an \nerror.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the archive file 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz to a\ntemporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer system. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>\nrepresents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On\nWindows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or\nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nNote: \n1. The prerequisite Log File Agent bundles must also be in the\ndepot, to ensure successful completion of the remote agent update.\n2. The 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP000<n> bundles must be removed from the\ndepot, using the \"tacmd removeBundles\" command. \nFor example: tacmd removeBundles -t lo -v 06300000<n>\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t lo \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 06300200\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t LO \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 06300200\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is\nspecified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the managed\nsystem name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5.2 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nFix pack 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0001 included new certificates \nin the agent support files which need to be installed. If you have\nalready installed these updates, there are no additional installation \nsteps. Otherwise, install the updates to the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Desktop. For more information about installing \napplication support, see Installing and enabling application support\nin the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide.\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or any\nof the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are\nrequired.\n\n6.2 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version. \n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t LO\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t LO \n\nNote: The component (-t) for the \"tacmd listSystems\" command is\nspecified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is: \n06.30.02.00.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.30.02.00. \n\n2. To verify the agent you are running contains the updates from the\nfix, see the following lines in the agent log \n<hostname>_lo_<instance>_kloagent_<timestamp>.log located in\n$CANDLEHOME/logs on UNIX systems and\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\tmaitm6\\logs on Windows systems:\n\n<timestamp> Component: ira\n<timestamp> Driver: agent_fac_63:201709131450/4769716.3 \n<timestamp> Timestamp: Sep 13 2017 ...\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n=========================\nNone.\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n======================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information\n================================== \nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml [www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml].\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

You guessed it...\n   the SCOM server runs on W2008 64bit.\n   \n   The short version:\n   The visit from Linwood Lassitter to KBC was succesful. He\n   created a version of the agent that KBC can use to fullfill\n   KBC's wishes.\n   \n   The long version:\n   The problem definitely is related to the fact that Windows2008\n   runs on 64bit and not on 32bit. There are multiple reasons for\n   this, for example the way the registry needs to be read is\n   different. The registry needs to be read to find the location\n   of the event logs.\n   That is how Linwood determined that the problem was the\n   following:\n   Our agent uses a Windows API to 'ask' wether we are running\n   32bit or 64bit.\n   Somehow what that API returned was not interpreted by the agent\n   correctly. Linwood fixed the problem. The fix was tested by KBC\n   on both a 64bit and a 32bit W2008 instance. At least it did\n   read the windows event log correctly. Some immediate simple\n   tests with other agent features did not reveal any problem. KBC\n   will continue testing with the newly compiled agent. Linwood\n   will create the APAR to create the official fix that will\n   become part of the the product.\n   \n   Patrick was already in touch with L3 (Linwood Lassiter, Tom Hemp\n   and Tim Buckley), and they replied:\n   I need this APAR opened on Monday (7/7). I am trying to include\n   this in the LA that we are pushing out now.  This is a critical\n   LA and I can not hold it up. If we can't get this APAR opened\n   and  miss this LA then the next opportunity will be August.\n   \n   Upon Linwood's suggestion, I ask if you could open an APAR for\n   the issue that KBC has with monitoring the eventlog on a\n   Windows 2008 system running in 64 bit. Linwood has the details\n   of this problem and the suggested fix.\n   I can pass the code change I made to the L3 team for\n   integration into the Code Library for build of an LA on 6.2FP1.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  N/A\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  The Monitoring agent for Windows OS was not able to read the\n   event log on Microsoft Windows 2008 Server running on 64-bit\n   sysyems. The registry is read to find the location of the event\n   logs. The Monitoring  agent for Windows OS uses a Windows API to\n   determine whether it is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit system.\n   The data returned by the API was not interpreted by the Monitori\n   ng agent for Windows OS correctly. The monitored logs in the\n   System workspace in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal do not show any\n   value. This fix resolves the problem and the Windows event log\n   is read correctly.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  This APAR has been fixed and delivered in a limited availability\n   fix 6.2.0.1-TIV-ITM_WIN-LA0002.

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Monitoring agent for MySQL when configured to monitor MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above does not collect data for some of the attribute groups. \n\nSYMPTOM\nData does not get collected for the following views that show system and status variable related information: \n\nView name Workspace name Navigator group name Statistics Statistics Availability Operations per second MySQL status data Availability Session status Agent Configuration Configuration Global status Global variables Server String properties Numeric properties Following exception is seen in the JDBC trace logs: \n\n- JdbcConnection.executeFromList-new - java.sql.SQLException: The 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.GLOBAL_STATUS' feature is disabled; see the documentation for 'show_compatibility_56' \n\nThe above error is seen for MySQL versions 5.7.9 and higher. For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. \n\n \n\nNote: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.\n\n\nCAUSE\nFew tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.\n\n\nMore details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nMySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUsers wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. \n\nThis variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: \n\nset global show_compatibility_56=ON; \n\n \n\nThe default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is \u2018ON\u2019 and for versions >=5.7.8 is \u2018OFF\u2019. \n\n \n\nUser can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: \n\nshow global variables like \"show_compatibility_56\"; \n\n \n\nThis variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. \n\nUser needs to add the following line to the \u2018my.cnf\u2019 file (located at \u2018<MySQL_Installation_Dir>/my.cnf\u2019 for Windows and \u2018/etc/my.cnf\u2019 for UNIX/Linux): \n\nshow_compatibility_56=ON \n\n \n\nThe paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file. For more details on where your installation of MySQL server looks for the 'my.cnf' file, refer the URL: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html] \n\n \n\nNote: Change in 'my.cnf' file will require a MySQL server re-start for the changes to take effect. \n\n \n\nMore details on the system variable 'show_compatibility_56' here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56 [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56]\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n Monitoring agent for MySQL Sever"

      "5724B96DOTR; 5724B96DOIN TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How does the ITCAM monitoring agent for DB2 database collect monitoring data? \n\nANSWER\nThe DB2 database monitoring agent collects data using following four methods:\n\n1) DB2 Snapshot Monitor - Snapshot API requests and responses. \n2) DB2 SQL Command Processor - When using SQL Commands, the agent uses select query to collect data. \n3) DB2 configuration parameters - DB Get Configuration Parameter API's \n4) DB2 Manager configuration parameters - DBM Get/Set Configuration Parameter API's \n\n\nNote: The collection method for each of the DB2 monitoring agent attribute groups is not published. An attribute group may display monitoring data collected using one or more of the above mentioned methods.",
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to create an SQL Server user and grant permissions to the user for monitoring the Microsoft SQL Server with the Microsoft SQL Server agent? \n\nANSWER\nQuestion\nHow to create an SQL Server user and grant permissions to the user for monitoring the Microsoft SQL Server with the Microsoft SQL Server agent?\n\nAnswer\nCreating a user and granting permissions \n\nOn the Microsoft SQL Server, you must create a user under which the agent runs, and grant permissions to the user for monitoring Microsoft SQL Server. The process of granting permissions is the same for Microsoft SQL Server 2005, or later.\n\n\nBefore you begin\nInstall the Microsoft SQL Server agent. To create a user and grant permissions to the user, you must have Sysdamin authorization role. \n\nProcedure\nTo create a user, complete the following steps:\n1. In the SQL Server Management Studio, open Object Explorer.\n2. Click Server_instance_name > Security > Logins.\n3. Right-click Logins and select New Login.\n4. On the General page, in the Login name field, type the name of user.\nImportant: Specify a windows user in case going for Windows authentication in step 5.\n5. Select Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication. \nImportant: If you select SQL authentication, you must set the password for the user.\n6. Depending on the role and permissions that you want to assign to this user, complete one of the following tasks:\nOn the Server Roles page, assign the sysadmin role to the new login ID.\nIf you do not want to assign the sysadmin role to the user, grant minimum permissions to the user by completing the steps that are mentioned in Granting minimum required permissions for data collection.\nImportant: By default, the public role is assigned to the new login ID.\n7. Click OK. \n\nResults\nA user is created with the default public role and the permissions that you assigned, and is displayed in the Logins list. \n\nGranting minimum required permissions for data collection\nApart from the default public role, you can assign the sysadmin role to a user so that the agent can collect data for all the agent attributes. If you don\u2019t want to assign the sysadmin role, you can grant some minimum required permissions to the user so that the agent can collect data for some data sets. \n\nAbout this task\nThe default public role is sufficient to collect data for most data sets. However, you must grant minimum required permissions to the user if you want the agent to collect data for the following data sets:\n\u00b7 Server details data set\n\u00b7 Database Details data set\n\u00b7 Job Details data set\n\u00b7 Database Mirroring data set\n\u00b7 Server Summary data set\n\u00b7 Job Summary data set\n\nProcedure\nTo grant minimum required permissions to the user, complete these steps: \n\n1. Open the Server Roles page and verify that the public check box is selected. \n\n2. Open the User Mapping page, and then select the following check boxes for all the system databases and the user-defined databases which you want to monitor:\n\u00b7 public\n\u00b7 db_owner\n\nFor the msdb database, select the following additional check boxes:\n\u00b7 db_datareader\n\u00b7 SQLAgentReaderRole\n\u00b7 SQLAgentUserRole\n\n3. Open the Securables page, and then select the following check boxes for the server instance that you are monitoring:\n\u00b7 View any database\n\u00b7 View any definition\n\u00b7 View server state \n\n \n\nGranting permission to perflib registry key for collecting data for few attribute groups \n\nBefore you begin\nThis permission must be granted to the windows user with which agent services are configured. There are many attribute groups that will be affected in absence of perflib permissions like MS SQL Database Detail, MS SQL Memory Manager, MS SQL Lock Resource Type Summary, MS SQL Job Summary, MS SQL Server Transactions Summary, MS SQL Server Summary, etc.\n\nProcedure\n1. Stop the SQL agent on the problematic server.\n2. To open the Registry Editor, click Start > Run > Type regedit.exe > Press Enter.\n3. Go to following registry key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Perflib\n4. Right-click the Perflib key, then click Permissions...\n5. Click Add\u2026, and add the windows user name with which agent is installed and configured and click OK.\n6. Click the user that you added.\n\nThere are three options of access levels [Full Control, Read, and Special permissions].\nFull Control - Permission to open, edit, and take ownership of the key.\nRead - Permission to read the key contents, but not edit any changes.\nSpecial - Permission to change the owner of key and selectively grant permission to its subkeys.\n\n7. Allow read access to the user by selecting the check box.\n8. Click Apply, and then OK.\n9. Start the agent on the problematic server and check the data.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n SQL MSSQL permissions 5724B96MO ITM Ticoli Monitoring",
      "5724B96SO TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases: Sybase Server Agent V6.2.0 needs IBM Tivoli Monitoring user to have 'sa_role' role. This document explains the root cause and the workaround. \n\nCAUSE\nThe Sybase Server Agent V6.2.0 depends on the Sybase DBCC MONITOR function to collect data for the following attribute groups: \n* Sybase Cache Detail (KOYCACD)\n* Sybase Cache Summary (KOYCACS)\n* Sybase Database Detail (KOYDBD)\n* Sybase Engine Detail (KOYENGD)\n* Sybase Engine Summary (KOYENGS)\n* Sybase Lock Detail (KOYLCKD)\n* Sybase Lock Summary (KOYLCKS)\n* Sybase Log Detail (KOYLOGD)\n* Sybase Log Summary (KOYLOGS)\n* Sybase Physical Device Detail (KOYSDEVD)\n* Sybase SQL Detail (KOYSQLD)\n* Sybase Task Detail (KOYTSKD)\n\nIn the previous version of Sybase ASE, Sybase ASE requires the user to have the 'sa_role' role to execute the DBCC MONITOR function. \n\nYou can create a user without granting the sa_role role to it, and execute the DBCC MONITOR command with the user:\n\n1> dbcc monitor(\"select\",\"all\",\"on\") \n2> go\nYou must have any of the following role(s) to execute this command/procedure: 'sa_role' . Please contact a user with the appropriate role for help. \n\nThis limitation is from Sybase ASE, not from the agent.\n\n\nANSWER\nBecause the 'sa_role' role is critical and many customers are concerned about it, Sybase Case 11573580 was opened for this problem. Sybase said that they will propose a fix for this issue and will allow DBCC MONITOR to be executed by non-sa_role users after being granted permission to execute it. \n\n\nIn Sybase ASE 15.0.3 ESD #4, Sybase ASE provides a solution, Bug ID:172714 \nDescription: New feature request to make DBCC MONITOR a grantable command.\n\nIf you are using ASE 15.0.3 ESD #4 or above, you can grant the IBM Tivoli Monitoring user permission for the DBCC MONITOR command instead of granting the IBM Tivoli Monitoring user the 'sa_role' role. For example:\n\n1> grant dbcc monitor to tivoli\n2> go\n\nYou also need to grant the IBM Tivoli Monitoring user the 'oper_role' role; otherwise, the agent reports an error when executing 'dump tran tempdb with truncate_only' command. For example:\n\n1> exec sp_role \"grant\", oper_role, tivoli\n2> go\n\nYou also need to add IBM Tivoli Monitoring user into database which Tivoli Monitoring user had no access before; otherwise it will have \"ESQ0060E (002603) The server encountered an error connecting to database <databasename>\" error in agent collector log. It will also affect data monitoring for 'Allocated Size In KB', 'Index Size In KB', 'Unallocated Size In KB', and 'Used Size In KB' attributes in 'Database Detail' attribute group. Please run below steps on each database which Tivoli Monitoring user had no access.\n1> use <database>\n2> go\n1> sp_adduser tivoli,tivoli\n2> go \n...\n\nNote: Change tivoli to the real IBM Tivoli Monitoring user that you use.\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n KOY",

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Monitoring agent for MySQL when configured to monitor MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above does not collect data for some of the attribute groups. \n\nSYMPTOM\nData does not get collected for the following views that show system and status variable related information: \n\nView name Workspace name Navigator group name Statistics Statistics Availability Operations per second MySQL status data Availability Session status Agent Configuration Configuration Global status Global variables Server String properties Numeric properties Following exception is seen in the JDBC trace logs: \n\n- JdbcConnection.executeFromList-new - java.sql.SQLException: The 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.GLOBAL_STATUS' feature is disabled; see the documentation for 'show_compatibility_56' \n\nThe above error is seen for MySQL versions 5.7.9 and higher. For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. \n\n \n\nNote: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.\n\n\nCAUSE\nFew tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.\n\n\nMore details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nMySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUsers wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. \n\nThis variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: \n\nset global show_compatibility_56=ON; \n\n \n\nThe default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is \u2018ON\u2019 and for versions >=5.7.8 is \u2018OFF\u2019. \n\n \n\nUser can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: \n\nshow global variables like \"show_compatibility_56\"; \n\n \n\nThis variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. \n\nUser needs to add the following line to the \u2018my.cnf\u2019 file (located at \u2018<MySQL_Installation_Dir>/my.cnf\u2019 for Windows and \u2018/etc/my.cnf\u2019 for UNIX/Linux): \n\nshow_compatibility_56=ON \n\n \n\nThe paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file.

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

      "ase session date sessiondate runaseutility jobstream job box .aserc aserc algosuitelocal.xml configfilepath algobatch ChangeDate TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When running a test batch, we find the session date is incorrect. Which places should we look for where the session date is set? \n\nCAUSE\nThe session date is a key input for batch simulation as this affects how ASE (Algo Scenario Engine) and RiskWatch calculate results. \n\nANSWER\nIn Production Batches, the session date is normally today's date. Test servers may have fixed dates in order to validate and compare reports when software and configuration data has changed.\n\nASE runs as a service. Once ASE is started, ASE will process scenario generation requests and output scenarios in either CSV or Binary format.\n\n1) By default, during startup ASE will obtain the Session Date from the configuration file $ALGO_TOP/cfg/.aserc under the setting SessionDate. It is import to note that the .aserc configuration file can be renamed to a different file which is defined in $ALGO_TOP/cfg/algosuitelocal.xml under the xml tag <default>/<ase>/<configfilepath>\n\nIf ASE has no session date set in .aserc, do not assume any session date has been set.\n\n2) If AlgoBatch is used to start ASE server (\"Start ASE job box\"), AlgoBatch will set the session date based in the jobstream configuration where the start-ASE job box is located. Use ABE (Algo Batch Editor) to check this value. For more information refer to the AlgoBatch User Guide.\n\n3) The most common method to set the Session Date for ASE is through the AlgoBatch \"jobstream.ChangeDate\" job box. This can be configured to take a database value, or increment from a previous date. However, in most cases a \"Date Control File\" is set. This is often $ALGO_TOP/dynamic/sessiondate.txt. As long as the \"Manage ASE Session Date\" is set to true, the ASE session date will be set when the job box is executed. For more information refer to the AlgoBatch Job Box Reference Guide pdf that is shipped with the AlgoOne software.\n\n4) Some batches may implement a manual method using runaseutility to \"-o SetSessionDate <date>\" in custom shell scripts. Customers should review their scripts for the runaseutility command.",
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Generating an Alphablox telnet trace for Alphablox Technical Support \n\nCAUSE\nOne of the primary tools for diagnosing Alphablox problems in a trace from within Alphablox's internal telnet console which provides real time logging and execution of Admin commands. Follow this technote to learn how to generate a telnet console log.\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n1) Find out your telnet port \n\n \n\nWhen Alphablox was installed, a Alphablox specific telnet port was defined. The default on Windows is 23, on Unix it is usually 20023 but your installer may have selected something different. To find out what it is, go to your Administration tab in Alphablox, and click the \"General Properties\"--> \"Telnet Console\" link on the left menu. You will see the port, and can also change the userid and password. \n\n \n\nNote: the user/password combination for the \"admin\" user to access the telnet console is separate from the user/password combination to access Alphablox administration pages, and may be different. \n\n \n\n2) Start a telnet session \n\n \n\nYou can use any telnet utilty you like but if useing the default one in a windows environment, enter the DOS command \"telnet <server> <telnetport>\", where <server> is the machine name or IP address where Alphablox is running, and <telnetport> is the Alphablox telnet port number from step 1 above. For example, if you are running Alphablox on a machine named pastrami, enter the following at a command prompt: \n\ntelnet pastrami 23 \n\nIt will prompt you for a user and password. \n\n \n\n3) Increase the buffer size of the telnet window \n\n \n\nRight-click the telnet icon (top left) in your window and select \"Properties\". Increase your \"Screen Buffer Size\" so that important logging messages don't get lost when there is a lot of output. A height of 1000 should be sufficient in most cases. \n\nWhen you click \"OK\", if you select \"Save properties for future windows with the same title\", then you can skip this step next time. \n\n \n\n4) Increase the telnet timeout value \n\n \n\nThe default Alphablox telnet session timeout is 15 minutes.

      "WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3.

NOT ACCESSABLE\nAdditional Information: A core dump occurs for the Oracle Database \nExtended agent if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME but, \n$ORACLE_HOME/bin/tnsping file did not grant read+execute permission\nto the agent OS user.\n\nAPAR : IV14403\nAbstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate \nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows systems:\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora \n\nIf this new variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file size:\n\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\n\nDefect: 172392\nAbstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in\nthe SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of\nBaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"SampleTable1\" GrantName=\"SampleTable1\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nIf you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent \nuser in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942\nbecause the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element \nwhile the agent runs continuously.\n\nThe error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized\nsql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml \nfile and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"dual\" GrantName=\"dual\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nDefect: 172695\nAbstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE \nAdditional Information: The RAS1 log file for the \nkrzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03. The\nfirst RAS1 log file is overwritten after the 3rd one \nis full. This action disenables you to see information, such as \nstart time during agent startup.\n\nAfter the application of the fix, in the following file examples\nthe RAS1 log message loops between the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log\" file and the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log\" file.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle \nrz.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. \nAfter this fix is installed, edit the latest rz.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this rz.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a \ntemporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be \nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents \nthe fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are\nrunning version 6.2.2 Fix Pack 2 or later of the OS monitoring \nagent.\n2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to \na temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \n<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all supported operating systems.\n\n4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\nabout the tacmd addBundles command, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WIA64/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WIA64\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information about the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated.

Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t RZ\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 063102000\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (rz), not three characters (krz).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux\nor UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the \nfollowing systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components are installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo\n\nThis command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows. Choose the option that meets your requirements.\n\n*********** Thu Aug 15 15:02:01 HKT 2013 ******************\nUser : root Group: root\nHost name : myaixsys Installer Lvl:06.22.02.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Show installed CD release versions\nX) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Thu Aug 15 15:02:01 HKT 2013 ******************\nUser : root Group: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel\nHost name : myaixsys Installer Lvl:06.22.02.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\n\nUnix/Linux: IBM Tivoli Enterprise Server Portal Server / IBM Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal Desktop, cinfo output:\n\nrz ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nli6263 Version: 06.31.02.00\n\nUnix/Linux: Extended Agent for Oracle Database\n\n\nrz ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nli6263 Version: 06.31.02.00\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run \nthe following command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\n>kincinfo -i\n\nkincinfo output:\n\nWindows: Tivoli Enterprise Server Portal Server / Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal Desktop\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nWindows: Extended Agent for Oracle Database:\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231 \n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\n- Problem: Oracle agent unable to logon to oracle database, due to\ninvalid password, after remote deploying or remote \nconfiguring, on a windows x64 system.\ndefect: 119668\nWorkaround: Upgrade the Windows OS agent to version 6.22 fp2.\n\n- Problem: Oracle agent running processes not stopped, after removing\nthe oracle agent instance from the tivoli enterprise \nmonitoring services management window, on a UNIX system.\ndefect: 120864\nWorkaround: Stop the Oracle Database Extended agent instance before removing it.\n\n- Problem: A connection of oracle agent not displayed on TEP, if the \nconnection name is too long.\ndefect: 121337\nWorkaround: Assign a short name to the Oracle Database Extended agent instance and \nconnection in the instance to avoid truncating the unique name(connection \nname + krz instance name + host name).\n\n- Problem: Unable to remote deploy oracle agent to a windows IA64 \nsystem, if no WINNT platform bundle exists in the TEMS \nrepository.\ndefect: 122095\nWorkaround: Add the 3 Windows operating system bundles (WINNT, WIX64, WIA64) to\nThe Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server repository before remotely deploying \non a Windows IA64 system.\n\n- Problem: Alert logs is not displaying customized message ID.\n- Workaround: If you must monitor custom message IDs in Alert logs,\nmessage IDs must be specified in the \ninstalldir/config/<host>_rz_<inst>_msgid.properties file\nand you must restart the agent to display it in the portal.\n\n- Problem: default value for \"Last Execution Error Code\" is displaying as 0\nin workspace \"Customized SQLs->RDB Customized SQL Summary status\".\n- Workaround: The customized SQLs are not executed during agent startup\nby default. These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or \nyou click \"Link to SQL Result\" in the workspace \"Customized SQLs ->\nRDB Customized SQL Summary Definition\".\n\n- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take\neffective.\n- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new\nerror trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the \ninstalldir/config/rz.ini file and the installdir/config/rz_<instance>.config\nfile, and you must restart agent.\n\n- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like\nfollowing. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

The value\nthat is displayed is less then the real value. \n\nArchive Node -> Flash Recovery workspace -> \nFlash Recovery Space Usage view\n\nAPAR : IV26915\nAbstract : ORA-12504: TNS:LISTENER WAS NOT GIVEN\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent logs are\nwritten at a rapid pace and growing large very quickly.\nThe following error message repeats:\n\n\"ORA-12504: TNS:listener was not given\".\n\nAPAR : IV30446\nAbstract : ALERT LOG MESSAGE TEXT IS GARBLED\nAdditional Information: The Japanese part of the Oracle alert\nlog message is garbled in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.\nThis garbled information might also occur in other multi-byte \ncharacter set (MBCS) locales, such as East Asian locales \nsuch as Simplified Chinese or Korean.\n\nAPAR : IV31219\nAbstract : RDB_SESSION_DETAILS WAREHOUSING ERROR 64\nAdditional Information: The historical data from the \nattribute group RDB_Session_Details table cannot be\nexported into the warehouse, because the value after UTF-8\nconversion has a length greater than the column ACTION defined\nwidth (32). Therefore, the row is not exported into\nwarehouse and the local historical data file size \nincreases continuously. This issue might also occur in other\nEast Asian locales such as Simplified Chinese or Korean.\n\nAPAR : IV36395\nAbstract : KRZCLIENT FILE HANDLE LEAK ON WINDOWS\nAdditional Information: \"Handle Count\" on Windows operating systems \nwhere the Oracle Extended Database agent is running is constantly \ngrowing. When the agent is restarted, the krzclient.exe process \nis using hundreds of file handles. The hundreds of file handles \nincreases to thousands of file handles in a few hours.\n\nAPAR : IV38555\nAbstract : KRZCLIENT CRASHES AT TOPSQL\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Extended Database agent krzclient\nprocess crashes and generates a core file when the process queries \nRDB Top SQL attribute groups.\n\n2.2 Defects\n-----------\n\n2.3 Enhancements: \n-----------------\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: User interface configuration improvements.\n\n- Simplifies the database connection configuration \nwith three connection types:\n- Basic: Oracle database server host name (or IP address),\nListener port, and Oracle database service\nname (or Oracle SID) must be specified.\n- TNS: only the TNS Alias must be specified or selected\nfrom the drop-down list that is discovered\nfrom the ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file.\n- Advanced: only the Oracle connection string must be \nspecified to be compatible with an old\nversion of agent configuration.\n\n- Supports the following connection string format: \n\"//hostname:port/ORACLE_SID\".\n\n- At least one database connection must be added during\nthe GUI configuration.\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: New environment variables that you can use to \ncustomize the agent, such as KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE, \nKRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE,\nKRZ_REDIRECT_TNS, KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL, and KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER.\n\n- Provides the option to control whether the agent monitors\nthe specific Listener name and Oracle net service end points.\nBoth including and excluding filters are provided \n(KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE,KRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, \nKRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE).\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_REDIRECT_TNS) to control whether\nto redirect the value of the predefined TNS_ADMIN environment\nvariable to the agent log directory to disable the Oracle \nsqlnet.log.\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL) to control which \nlevel of agent event is sent. The level with a scope from high\nto low is MISC, INFO, WARN, or ERROR.\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER) to control whether the\nagent combines the filter information in the SQL query that is\nsent to the Oracle database for the data processing.\n\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: Performance improvement for Top SQL monitoring.\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: Disk Space usage monitoring for Archive Destination\nwhen Archive destination is defined in the Oracle database as\nUSE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST instead of a real physical directory.\n\nEnhancement: \nAbstract: More SQL statement samples in the krzcussql.properties\ncustomized SQL template file for Oracle Jobs, Oracle Users, \nand Oracle Queues monitoring.\n\nA total of six sample SQL statements are in the default \ncustomized SQL template file. To ensure the sample customized\nSQL can be run successfully, the SELECT authority from \ncorresponding Oracle performance views must be granted to the\nOracle user of the agent in advance.\n\nSQL_ID: mytablespace\nSQL_TEXT: select * from dba_tables; \nOracle Views to be granted SELECT permission: dba_tables\n\nSQL_ID: mytest\nSQL_TEXT: SELECT SID, \nSQL_CHILD_NUMBER FROM v$session\nOracle Views to

fixes\n---------------------------------------------------- \n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR : IV22637\nAbstract : AGENT CORE DUMP IF TNSPING IS NOT ACCESSABLE\nAdditional Information: A core dump occurs for the Oracle Database \nExtended agent if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME but, \n$ORACLE_HOME/bin/tnsping file did not grant read+execute permission\nto the agent OS user.\n\nAPAR : IV14403\nAbstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate \nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows systems:\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora \n\nIf this new variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file size:\n\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\n\nDefect: 172392\nAbstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in\nthe SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of\nBaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"SampleTable1\" GrantName=\"SampleTable1\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nIf you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent \nuser in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942\nbecause the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element \nwhile the agent runs continuously.\n\nThe error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized\nsql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml \nfile and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"dual\" GrantName=\"dual\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nDefect: 172695\nAbstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE \nAdditional Information: The RAS1 log file for the \nkrzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03. The\nfirst RAS1 log file is overwritten after the 3rd one \nis full. This action disenables you to see information, such as \nstart time during agent startup.\n\nAfter the application of the fix, in the following file examples\nthe RAS1 log message loops between the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log\" file and the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log\" file. The\n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-01.log\" file\nis not overwritten.\n\n#cd /opt/IBM/ITM/logs && ls *krzclient*.log\ntivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-01.log\ntivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log\ntivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log\n\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\n----------------------------------------------------\nAPAR : IZ77624\nAbstract : AGENT GETS ERROR ORA-01722 INVALID NUMBER ORACLE EXTENDED AGENT\n6.3.0 ON DISTRIBUTED PLATFORM\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent returns no data\nto the Tivoli Enterprise Portal because of ORA-01722.\n\nAPAR : IZ83799\nAbstract : UNDO TABLESPACE %USED IS WRONG\nAdditional Information: The RDB_TablespaceNormal_Usage attribute group\nPCIUSED (% Used) attribute is incorrect for UNDO tablespace.\n\nAPAR : IZ84903\nAbstract : ITM RZ AGENT DOES NOT SUPPORT ORACLE 9I\nAdditional Information: The corrected prerequisite was republished\nin the information center, see the \"Supported applications\" section at \nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.4/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.4/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html]\nNote: For Oracle Database Servers: Requires Version 10.1.0.1 or later.\n\nAPAR : IZ87013\nAbstract : DBCONNECTION IN SUBNODE NOT TRUNCATED\nAdditional Information: Subnode ID as part of the subnode name must not be\nlonger then 25 characters, because of IBM Tivoli Monitoring limitations.\nThe entire subnode ID is truncated instead of the DBConnection part\nbeing truncated.\nNote: Subnode ID format: DBConnection-AgentInstance-Hostname.\n\nThe following troubleshooting Technote was published:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21455513 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21455513]\n\nAPAR : IZ92572\nAbstract : SITUATION DOES NOT FIRE WITH SCAN FILTER\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent gets an incorrect\nfilter operator of 'EQ' when a situation includes the SCAN filter with the 'NE'\noperator.\nThe wrong operator causes the agent not to get the required data from the\nOracle database, and situations cannot be fired even if there are matched\ndata rows for this situation.\n\nAPAR : IZ95428\nAbstract : KRZGRANT.SQL RETURNS ORA-01722 ERROR IN AN ORACLE ENVIRONMENT\nUSING A NON-STANDARD NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACHTERS STRING\nAdditional Information: Using a non-standard NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS string\nin the Oracle environment causes the problem.\n\nAPAR : IZ95117\nAbstract : CANNOT MONITOR ORACLE TM LOCK\nAdditional Information: The agent can detect only the Transaction Lock\n(type=TX) and cannot detect the DML or Table Lock(type=TM) in the Oracle\ndatabase.\n\nAPAR : IZ95898\nAbstract : KRZCLIENT CORE DUMP AT ALERT LOG READING\nAdditional Information: krzclient causes a core dump if the alert log is archived\nand newly generated alert log is the same size as the previous one.\n\nDefect: 136835\nAbstract: RDB Alert Log Details attribute group Message Timestamp attribute\nshows an incorrect value for timestamp with timezone.\n\n2.6 Enhancements included from superseded fixes\n----------------------------------------------------\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nSelf-describing agent (SDA) application support installation is supported. \nTo take advantage of self-describing agent capability, your \nTivoli Management Services server components must be \nVersion 6.2.3 Fixpack 1 or later.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\nEnhancement: RFE\nHeadline: Improve Oracle Database Extended Agent not to contact ORCL instance\n(SYS4472)\nID: 12585\nDescription: \nStop the behavior where the Oracle Extended Database agent tries to connect\nagainst the Oracle default instance \"ORCL\" every time when checking\nLISTENERs/TNS.\nThe Oracle Extended Database agent is hard-coded to try to connect against\nan Oracle Instance \"ORCL\" that does not exist on most systems.\nBy default, the agent tries to connect every 5 minutes. \nTherefore, the Oracle database creates \"connect error 12514\" Log Entries\neach time, which fills up the log files.\n\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Extended Database agent uses the tnsping Oracle\nutility tool in the ORACLE_HOME/bin path to verify the \nListener status if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle \nrz.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. \nAfter this fix is installed, edit the latest rz.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this rz.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a \ntemporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be \nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents \nthe fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are\nrunning version 6.2.2 Fix Pack 2 or later of the OS monitoring \nagent.\n2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to \na temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \n<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all supported operating systems.\n\n4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\nabout the tacmd addBundles command, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WIA64/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WIA64\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information about the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated.

Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t RZ\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 063102000\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (rz), not three characters (krz).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux\nor UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the \nfollowing systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components are installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo\n\nThis command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows. Choose the option that meets your requirements.\n\n*********** Thu Aug 15 15:02:01 HKT 2013 ******************\nUser : root Group: root\nHost name : myaixsys Installer Lvl:06.22.02.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Show installed CD release versions\nX) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Thu Aug 15 15:02:01 HKT 2013 ******************\nUser : root Group: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel\nHost name : myaixsys Installer Lvl:06.22.02.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\n\nUnix/Linux: IBM Tivoli Enterprise Server Portal Server / IBM Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal Desktop, cinfo output:\n\nrz ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nli6263 Version: 06.31.02.00\n\nUnix/Linux: Extended Agent for Oracle Database\n\n\nrz ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nli6263 Version: 06.31.02.00\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run \nthe following command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\n>kincinfo -i\n\nkincinfo output:\n\nWindows: Tivoli Enterprise Server Portal Server / Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal Desktop\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231\n\nWindows: Extended Agent for Oracle Database:\n\nRZ ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database\nWINNT Version: 06.31.02.00 Build: 201308012231 \n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\n- Problem: Oracle agent unable to logon to oracle database, due to\ninvalid password, after remote deploying or remote \nconfiguring, on a windows x64 system.\ndefect: 119668\nWorkaround: Upgrade the Windows OS agent to version 6.22 fp2.\n\n- Problem: Oracle agent running processes not stopped, after removing\nthe oracle agent instance from the tivoli enterprise \nmonitoring services management window, on a UNIX system.\ndefect: 120864\nWorkaround: Stop the Oracle Database Extended agent instance before removing it.\n\n- Problem: A connection of oracle agent not displayed on TEP, if the \nconnection name is too long.\ndefect: 121337\nWorkaround: Assign a short name to the Oracle Database Extended agent instance and \nconnection in the instance to avoid truncating the unique name(connection \nname + krz instance name + host name).\n\n- Problem: Unable to remote deploy oracle agent to a windows IA64 \nsystem, if no WINNT platform bundle exists in the TEMS \nrepository.\ndefect: 122095\nWorkaround: Add the 3 Windows operating system bundles (WINNT, WIX64, WIA64) to\nThe Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server repository before remotely deploying \non a Windows IA64 system.\n\n- Problem: Alert logs is not displaying customized message ID.\n- Workaround: If you must monitor custom message IDs in Alert logs,\nmessage IDs must be specified in the \ninstalldir/config/<host>_rz_<inst>_msgid.properties file\nand you must restart the agent to display it in the portal.\n\n- Problem: default value for \"Last Execution Error Code\" is displaying as 0\nin workspace \"Customized SQLs->RDB Customized SQL Summary status\".\n- Workaround: The customized SQLs are not executed during agent startup\nby default. These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or \nyou click \"Link to SQL Result\" in the workspace \"Customized SQLs ->\nRDB Customized SQL Summary Definition\".\n\n- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take\neffective.\n- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new\nerror trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the \ninstalldir/config/rz.ini file and the installdir/config/rz_<instance>.config\nfile, and you must restart agent.\n\n- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like\nfollowing. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * /etc/security/limits Description ulimit -c [value] core\ncore_hard Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) data\ndata_hard Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] fsize\nfsize_hard File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] nofiles\nnofiles_hard Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value]\n(K bytes) rss\nrss_hard The memory size of the process in kilobytes. ulimit -r [value] threads\nthreads_hard Max number of threads per process. ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) stack\nstack_hard The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) cpu\ncpu_hard Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -u [value] nproc\nnproc_hard Specifies the limit of the number of processes per user. * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information \n\n\nHP-UX \n\nThere is no global settings file on HP-UX. Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nThere are similar kernel settings you can also set with kctune, such as \"maxfiles_lim\", but these kernel parameters do not normally need to be changed. Please refer to its man page for further information. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand \"ulimit\" limit_name* Description ulimit -c [value] Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value] Data segment size of processes in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -f [value] File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value] The memory size of the process in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -s [value] The stack segment size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\nLinux \nGlobal settings are set in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. \n\nThe format for setting each limit is as follows:\n<domain> <type> <item> <value> \n\n<domain> controls which users or groups will have these limits \n\n<type> is either the string \"soft\" or \"hard\" limits.\nThe hyphen \"-\" can also be used which represents both soft and hard limits \n\n<item> and <value> are shown in the table below. Most values can also use the string unlimited. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between Linux variants. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits.conf file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name /etc/security/limits.conf <item> Description ulimit -c [value] core Max core dump file size (KB) ulimit -d [value] data Max data size (KB) ulimit -f [value] fsize Max file size (KB) ulimit -l [value] memlock Max size of address space that can be locked into memory (KB) ulimit -n [value] nofile Max number of open files/sockets per process** ulimit -u [value] nproc Max number of processes for a single user ulimit -m [value] rss Max resident set size (KB) ulimit -s [value] stack The maximum stack size (KB) ulimit -t [value] cpu Max CPU time (minutes or seconds) ** There is a restriction that occurs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that this value cannot be set to unlimited \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolaris \n\nThere is no global settings file specifically for ulimits on Solaris (however you can set kernel-wide settings in the /etc/system file). Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21377724]\nAIX - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.aix.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]\nLinux - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.lnx.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]"

Scenario: \nCustomer is downloading items using manageItem API. They have a simple service, which calls manageItem API to create items reading the messages from a queue. They are frequently facing \"Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Too many open files\" error and their agents stop working. On restarting the agent, it starts working properly. The issue is because of repeated lookup call (to propagate the cache to all the other JVMs) requiring RMI channels. This error happens because of a high demand for a common resource [RMI Channel] and/or because of insufficient limit configured at the OS level. For Example: When system repeatedly makes the RMI calls (because of Item Updates happening at a very high frequency), there is not enough time given for the context closure or release of resources resulting in the channel exhaustion ultimately causing the Socket Exception.

There are two options (Sterling Support strongly recommends option#1). 1. Disable the cache for the entity for which the frequent RMI calls occur. 2. It is worth checking with the System Administrator for any limits set for this at the operating system level and if possible to stretch those limits.

      "troubleshoot; performance; search; search performance; investigate TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What can be done to troubleshoot search performance in DB2\u00ae Document Manager? \n\nANSWER\nThe following is a general action plan to troubleshoot search performance issues. \n\n * First, perform a simple search with the default view. This will help you determine performance when using a simple search. Poor search performance with a simple search may imply a problem with the connector code, DB2 Document Manager, or the repository database. \n * In the next step, duplicate the simple search on the target repository's thick or native client.This step can help you determine the best performance possible when using just the native connector code. \n * The results of these tests can help to isolate the problem. However, note that the search performance with the native client (which communicates directly with the repository) will always be faster than the search performance with DB2 Document Manager. For DB2 Document Manager, the search performance will be relatively slower, because the search has to pass through more layers of code than it does with the native client search. \n * Other factors that could impact overall performance are, network connectivity and database tuning. \n * The network connectivity between the DB2 Document Manager server and the repository may be examined for possible network issues that could impact performance.

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * /etc/security/limits Description ulimit -c [value] core\ncore_hard Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) data\ndata_hard Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] fsize\nfsize_hard File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] nofiles\nnofiles_hard Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value]\n(K bytes) rss\nrss_hard The memory size of the process in kilobytes. ulimit -r [value] threads\nthreads_hard Max number of threads per process. ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) stack\nstack_hard The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) cpu\ncpu_hard Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -u [value] nproc\nnproc_hard Specifies the limit of the number of processes per user. * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information \n\n\nHP-UX \n\nThere is no global settings file on HP-UX. Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nThere are similar kernel settings you can also set with kctune, such as \"maxfiles_lim\", but these kernel parameters do not normally need to be changed. Please refer to its man page for further information. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand \"ulimit\" limit_name* Description ulimit -c [value] Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value] Data segment size of processes in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -f [value] File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value] The memory size of the process in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -s [value] The stack segment size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\nLinux \nGlobal settings are set in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. \n\nThe format for setting each limit is as follows:\n<domain> <type> <item> <value> \n\n<domain> controls which users or groups will have these limits \n\n<type> is either the string \"soft\" or \"hard\" limits.\nThe hyphen \"-\" can also be used which represents both soft and hard limits \n\n<item> and <value> are shown in the table below. Most values can also use the string unlimited. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between Linux variants. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits.conf file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name /etc/security/limits.conf <item> Description ulimit -c [value] core Max core dump file size (KB) ulimit -d [value] data Max data size (KB) ulimit -f [value] fsize Max file size (KB) ulimit -l [value] memlock Max size of address space that can be locked into memory (KB) ulimit -n [value] nofile Max number of open files/sockets per process** ulimit -u [value] nproc Max number of processes for a single user ulimit -m [value] rss Max resident set size (KB) ulimit -s [value] stack The maximum stack size (KB) ulimit -t [value] cpu Max CPU time (minutes or seconds) ** There is a restriction that occurs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that this value cannot be set to unlimited \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolaris \n\nThere is no global settings file specifically for ulimits on Solaris (however you can set kernel-wide settings in the /etc/system file). Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21377724]\nAIX - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.aix.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]\nLinux - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.lnx.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]"

      "StackOverflow; overflowing; recursion; recursively; jit; JustInTime; Hot; Spot; WebSphere; Just-In-Time TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Stack Overflow exceptions can occur when a thread stack continues to grow in size until reaching the maximum limit. \n\nSYMPTOM\n A stack overflow can result from: \n\n * A deeply nested application \n * An infinite loop within an application \n * A problem in just-in-time (JIT) compiled code \n * Applications requiring a larger stack size, especially ones relying on XML, GUI, or java2D classes. \n * Native method calls\n\n\nStack overflow issues are frequently masked by Out of Memory exceptions. By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java\u2122 Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following\n\n\n\n\npending=java.lang.StackOverflowError \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExplanations and Solutions \n\nInfinite Recursion \nIf an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized).

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When viewing a PDF document in OnDemand, I receive the following error: \n\n\"dispatch -acroexch.app could not be loaded\" \n\nCAUSE\nIf the application's Data Type is defined as PDF, the OnDemand client requires Adobe\u00ae Acrobat to be installed in order to view the PDF document. \nThe OnDemand client requires an Adobe Acrobat viewer that contains an OLE interface to view the PDF, which is only provided in Adobe Acrobat (Adobe Reader does not provide this OLE interface).\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you get the error: unable to load adobeacrobatexch when you view a PDF document from the OnDemand client, take the following steps: \n\n 1. Ensure that you have Adobe Acrobat installed and associated with the .pdf extension in Windows\u00ae. \n 2. In the C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\OnDemand32\\PDF directory, copy the ARSPDF32.API file to your adobe/acrobat/plugins directory. \n 3. Restart your OnDemand client and attempt to view the PDF document again.\n\n\nNote: The OnDemand client will attempt to automatically perform step 2 during installation if Adobe Acrobat is previously installed.  \n\nAlternatively, if the Data Type under the application is user-defined .pdf, the OnDemand client will instead launch the application associated with this extension in Windows to handle the viewing of this document. In this situation, Adobe Reader can be used to view the PDF, as this will bypass viewing the document within the OnDemand client and through the OLE interface.",

      "StackOverflow; overflowing; recursion; recursively; jit; JustInTime; Hot; Spot; WebSphere; Just-In-Time TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Stack Overflow exceptions can occur when a thread stack continues to grow in size until reaching the maximum limit. \n\nSYMPTOM\n A stack overflow can result from: \n\n * A deeply nested application \n * An infinite loop within an application \n * A problem in just-in-time (JIT) compiled code \n * Applications requiring a larger stack size, especially ones relying on XML, GUI, or java2D classes. \n * Native method calls\n\n\nStack overflow issues are frequently masked by Out of Memory exceptions. By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java\u2122 Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following\n\n\n\n\npending=java.lang.StackOverflowError \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExplanations and Solutions \n\nInfinite Recursion \nIf an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

      "web server; ihs; ibm http server; apache; websphere plug-in; plugin TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\nThe instructions in the Lotus Domino Administrator Help seem to be clear in regards to setting up Lotus Domino and IBM HTTP Server (IHS) on AIX platforms, but are there specific instructions for a Windows installation?\n\nANSWER\nThe following instructions from the Domino Administrator Help have been modified to specifically address a Windows installation of IBM HTTP Server. For AIX guidelines, refer to the Domino Administrator Help. \n\nModified Help entry: \n\nThe IBM HTTP Server (IHS) is packaged as part of the WebSphere Application Server (WAS). For information on installing IHS and the WebSphere server see the WebSphere installation documentation. Installing the plug-in is an option during WebSphere installation. For information on installing the plug-in during WebSphere setup, see the WebSphere installation documentation. \n\n\nNote: Beginning with the Domino 8 server, the Web Server Plugins for IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application server no longer ships with the Domino plugins file kit (the plugin-cfg.xml and iisWASPlugin_http.dll files).\nTo install the WebSphere plug-in from Domino \n\n 1. Install a Domino server. \n\n 2. On the IHS server, create the appropriate directory structure (if it does not already exist from a current installation of WebSphere Application Server). \n\n * \n * \n * c:\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\bin \n * c:\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\config \n * c:\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\logs\n\n\n3. Copy the following files from the Domino server to the IHS server (you may need to rename existing DLLs and XML files in the pre-existing WebSphere directory):  * \n * \n *  \n   Note: If using IHS 6.0, use mod_was_ap20_http.dll instead of mod_ibm_app_server_http.dll \n * \n * \n * Copy <Domino data directory>/domino/plug-ins/plugin-cfg.xml to C:\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\config \n * NOTE: These instructions assume that you have the WebSphere Application Server \"/bin\" directory specified in your PATH environment variable. \n\n\n4. On the IHS server, edit the IHS configuration file httpd.conf (on a default installation this file is located at C:\\IBM HTTP Server\\conf\\httpd.conf). Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:  * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\nNote: If using IHS 6.0, use the following LoadModule directive:  * \n * \n\n\n5. Modify the plugin-cfg.xml file according to the instructions for configuring the WebSphere plug-in. \nHide details for Steps to modify the plugin-cfg.xml file [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104930&amp;aid=1]Steps to modify the plugin-cfg.xml file The WebSphere configuration file WebSphere\\AppServer\\config\\plugin-cfg.xml controls the operation of the plug-in. In order for the plug-in to relay requests to the target Domino server, you must add directives to plugin-cfg.xml to define a transport route to the server, and pattern rules for the url namespaces that identify requests which are to be relayed to Domino. The plug-in will only relay requests that match a namespace rule. All other requests will be handled by the frontend Web server. \n\nTo configure plugin-cfg.xml: \n\n1. Open plugin-cfg.xml in Notepad. \n\n2. Modify the <Transport> element to target the appropriate Domino server. To do this, change the Hostname and Port parameters to the proper values required for the plug-in to reach your backend server's HTTP task. For example: \n\n * \n * <ServerGroup Name=\"default_group\">  * \n    * <!-- The transport defines the hostname and port value that the web server plug-in will use to communicate with the application server. --> \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   </ServerGroup> \n   \n\n3. Add these directives to the top of the <UriGroup> section. These directives specify common URL patterns needed for accessing Domino Web applications.  * <UriGroup Name=\"default_host_URIs\">  <Uri Name=\"*/*.nsf*\"/> \n   <Uri Name=\"*/icons/*\"/>\n   <Uri Name=\"*/domjava/*\"/>\n   </UriGroup>\n   \n   \n   \n\nIf your Domino application requires additional namespaces, you can create <Uri> directives for those patterns also. Note All the WAS plugins automatically reread the configuration file once a minute to pick up changes. If you don't want to wait that long, you must stop and restart the frontend Web server.

Start Domino. \n\n 2. To verify that the Domino server HTTP task is functional, from a browser enter the url http://<domino server name:http port>/homepage.nsf (or any other NSF request supported by your Domino Web application). This request should be sent directly to the Domino server, and the Domino HTTP task should respond with the expected page. \n\n 3. Start the frontend Web server. \n\n 4. To verify that the frontend server is functional and that the plug-in is working, in the browser enter http://<frontend-server:http port>/homepage.nsf. This request should be sent to the frontend server; the WebSphere plug-in should relay it to the Domino server. The resulting page should look identical to Step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n * \n *",

      "HTTP Server; IHS adminconsole; WebSphere Administrative console; TroubleShootingDocument; TroubleShootingFlowDocument TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n This document should help address common issues with this component before calling IBM support and save you time. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nSteps to help resolve connection problems to IBM HTTP Server Admin server \n\n\n 1. Is the Application Server, deployment manager, able to connect to the Web server over the management port. By default, using the adminctl process, this port will be 8008. When using a Java\u2122 nodeagent process on the Web server, for a managed node, this will be over port 8880 or 8879.\n    \n    This can be tested using the following command:\n    \n    telnet <webserverip> <port> \n    telnet 1.2.3.4 8880 \n    Where 1.2.3.4 is the IP address of the Web server system.  * Yes, this should give a SOAP fault error response. This simply shows that a connection can be established and there is no firewall or network issues.\n       \n       \n     * No, you must investigate to see what would block the deployment manager from connecting to the webserver over the admin port. (If you are still unable to find the root cause of this, then the mustgather doc at the bottom of this technote will be needed.)\n    \n    \n    \n 2. If you are able to establish the connection then we need to check the admin_access.log file within the install_root/logs/ directory.  1. If you have entries like the following with a 401 response code:\n        \n        \"POST /wasadmin/ HTTP/1.1\" 401 \n        Then the user ID that was passed from the administrative console is not added to the admin.passwd file. You must use the install_root/bin/htpasswd command to add the user name and password, which is set in the deployment manager administrative console for this Web server. \n        \n     2. If there are other errors then such as invalid path or file not found errors within the admin_error log then the paths within the deployment manager administrative console for that Web server are not correct.\n        \n        The commands and data sent to the Web server admin process is based on the configuration within the deployment manager.\n        \n        For example:\n        \n        /opt/IHS_HOME./ \n        The preceding path would fail to start the Web server process as there is no \".\" within the directory name on the Web server. This would result in the bin/ directory not being found and not allowing apachectl to be started. \n        \n     3. If no errors are found, or the error is unclear, collect the MustGather at the bottom of this technote and send that into WebSphere Application Server support.\n        \n    \n    \n 3. The Web server process, apachectl, never gets called and an httpd process is never shown.\n    \n    Most cases this is due to the fact that the httpd.conf file is trying to listen on a port below 1024, which requires that the httpd process be started as root.\n    \n    To start the httpd process as root, the management process, adminctl, or Java nodeagent, must be running as root.\n    \n    \n 4. When all else fails, from a command prompt try to invoke the deployment manager GUI command to see what data is passed to the Web server then this data can be compared to the Web server configuration and paths to validate the command issued by the deployment manager was correct.\n    \n    To do this:\n    \n    Issue an mbean call to the Web server for specific operation you are trying to complete. To do this, run wsadmin on the deployment manager or application server. Then run the following:\n    \n    set mb [$AdminControl queryNames type=WebServer,*]\n    $AdminControl invoke $mb <operation> { <cellName> <nodeName> <serverName> } \n    Where, operation is \"start/stop/ping/status\" cell/node/server is the repository location of the Web server in which the operation is performed on. \n    Ping would be the best operation to use when trying to determine cause of start/stop/console status problems. File transfer is more difficult to diagnose. If there is a file transfer problem (such as viewing log files), it might be helpful to issue a ping or start/stop request as the underylying issue might be the same. Running this command should help provide more insight into cause of problem. \n    \n\nWhat to do next \nIf the preceding troubleshooting steps did not help solve your problem, see the MustGather [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21174894]for WebSphere Application Server HTTP plug-in problems to continue investigation. \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK",

An XML Firewall service does not have this option available by default. Therefore, to have a service send redirects to a client, you can configure your WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance as described below: \n\n \n\n 1.  Create an XML Firewall. \n 2.  Create a policy and configure your request rule. \n 3.  Create a new rule which is an error rule. \n 4.  This rule contains a match, a transformation, and a result action. \n     It should look like this: \n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=1]\n     \n 5.   \n 6.  The XSL transform is where you set the HTTP response code to 302 or 307 and the \"Location\" to where you want to redirect the request. \n 7.  The XSL file should look like this. Modify the Location, http://myDomain.de/test, if you want to use this example. \n     \n     <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n     <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" \n     xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\" xmlns:dp=\"http://www.datapower.com/extensions\" \n     xmlns:dpconfig=\"http://www.datapower.com/param/config\" \n     extension-element-prefixes=\"dp\" \n     exclude-result-prefixes=\"dp dpconfig\">\n     <xsl:output method=\"xml\" indent=\"yes\"/>\n     <xsl:param name=\"dpconfig:redirectBadInput\" select=\"'http://myDomain.de/test'\"/>\n     <xsl:template match=\"/\">\n     <xsl:message>\n     <xsl:text>*** Redirect to custom error page: </xsl:text>\n     <xsl:value-of select=\"$dpconfig:redirectBadInput\"/>\n     <xsl:text>*** Done </xsl:text>\n     </xsl:message>\n     <dp:set-http-response-header name=\"'x-dp-response-code'\" value=\"'302 redirected'\"/> \n     <dp:set-http-response-header name=\"'Location'\" value=\"$dpconfig:redirectBadInput\"/>\n     </xsl:template>\n     </xsl:stylesheet></code>]\n     \n     \n 8.

      "IMF50; IMF60; WL60; WL61; WL62 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n DataPower Gateway Appliance is a security & integration gateway appliance, built for simplified deployment & hardened security, bridging multiple protocols & performing conversions at wire speed. IBM Worklight provides a powerful mobile application development platform for the enterprise. This article demonstrates how DataPower can be used in the DMZ of your enterprise to protect Worklight mobile application traffic. \n\nCONTENT\nIntroduction \n\nAs you mobile-enable your enterprise, there are several aspects of security to consider. When protecting mobile application traffic that is coming from your customer and employee devices into your network you want to protect the traffic from being altered, authenticate these users, and authorize their access to applications. In this article we showcase how to leverage the security gateway features of DataPower to protect mobile application traffic initiated by a client Worklight application.\n\n\nPatterns for Integration\n\nEnterprise topologies generally include designating different zones of protection so that specific processing can be secured and optimized. There are several ways DataPower can be leveraged in the DMZ and in other zones within your network to protect enterprise resources. As you start to build out Worklight applications to be delivered to the devices of your customers and employees these methods can be applied to mobile traffic. Here are some key methods observed: \n\n * DMZ\n *  Reverse Proxy Pattern - DataPower as a front-end Reverse Proxy and Security Gateway for your mobile applications built with and deployed on a Worklight Server REST Service Fa\u00e7ade Pattern - DataPower protecting REST endpoints in the DMZ without utilizing Worklight adaptors for integration. \n * \n * Intranet\n *  Mediation Pattern - DataPower providing protocol and message transformation and security for enterprise services that are integrated via Worklight adapters and enabling connectivity to your existing SOA infrastructure. Federated SSO with Authorization Pattern - DataPower to authorize authenticated access to OAuth protected resources \n\nThis article will focus on the Reverse Proxy Pattern. Subsequent articles will highlight and elaborate on these and other patterns as they emerge. \n\n\nThe Setup \n\nIn the following sections you will learn how to setup and use DataPower Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) service to proxy and secure access to Worklight mobile applications. We are going to demonstrate using either HTTP basic authentication or HTTP form based login between the mobile client and DataPower. DataPower will authenticate the user and generate a LTPA SSO token to be used for the back-end WebSphere Application Server. See Figure 1. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=1]\nFigure 1 : DataPower will authenticate the user and protect the communication to the Worklight Server\n\nThe following diagram shows a typical interaction between the user/application and the server.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&amp;aid=2]\n\nIn order to establish this pattern it is recommended you follow these steps: \n\n 1. Install and configure a Worklight environment and test the install with a simple application without DataPower acting as the reverse proxy to make sure your application logic works. \n 2. Configure a MPGW on DataPower to proxy the mobile application (or the Worklight console). The configuration of the gateway for these two patterns is described below.  * Utilize Basic Authentication for end user authentication with AAA, and generate Single Signed On (SSO) LTPA token for Worklight Server, running on WebSphere Application Server if user has successfully authenticated. \n     * Utilize HTML Form Based Login with AAA, and generate Single Signed On (SSO) LTPA token for Worklight Server, running on WebSphere Application Server if user has successfully authenticated.\n    \n    \n 3. Testing with a reverse proxy will involve the following.  * Updating the Worklight configuration on the server with the reverse proxy configuration (see below) \n     * Update the mobile application mobile security test configuration to use form based authentication , which means the application requires to authenticate immediately upon startup. Either HTTP Basic Authentication or HTML Form Based Login is supported before the application starts. For web widgets, widget resources are only accessible to the browser after user has successfully authenticated.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWorklight Specific Configuration Setup \n\nThis section assumes you already have installed Worklight Studio and your stand-alone server environment on Liberty or WebSphere Application Server. \n\nAdding the reverse proxy involves taking actions on each of the applications you are configuring. You need to modify the authenticationConfig.xml on the server to include the WASLTPAofRealm, login module, and security test. Use the WASLTPA realm to indicate that all the of applications within this realm will use LTPA tokens for their SSO and it would be configured like the following: \n\n<securityTests>  * \n * <testDeviceId provisioningType=\"none\"/> \n   <testUser realm=\"WASLTPARealm\"/> \n * \n * \n * \n * <testUser realm=\"WASLTPARealm\"/> \n * \n\n</securityTests> \n\n<realms>  * \n * \n * \n * <className>com.worklight.core.auth.ext.WebSphereFormBasedAuthenticator</className> \n   <parameter name=\"login-page\" value=\"/login.html\"/> \n   <parameter name=\"error-page\" value=\"/loginError.html\"/> \n * \n\n</realms> \n\n<loginModules>  * \n * \n * \n * <className>com.worklight.core.auth.ext.WebSphereLoginModule</className> \n * \n\n</loginModules> \n\nNote: This file is typically available at <WAS_INSTALL_DIR>/profiles/<WAS_PROFILE>/installedApps/<WAS_CELL>/IBM_Worklight_Console.ear/worklight.war/WEB-INF/classes/conf. \n\nYou will need to restart the Worklight console enterprise application after you make this change. \n\n\nClient Mobile Application Update \n\nIn your client mobile application, add the following JavaScript to your HTML Worklight application. See the attached sample for the exact location and the JavaScript (JS) file. \n\nfunction showLoginScreen() {  * \n\n} \n\nfunction showMainScreen() {  * \n * \n * \n\n} \n\nvar myChallengeHandler = WL.Client.createChallengeHandler(\"WASLTPARealm\"); \nvar lastRequestURL; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.isCustomResponse = function(response) { \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * return true; \n * \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * lastRequestURL = response.request.url; \n   return true; \n * \n\n * \n * worklight\n * \n * \n * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.handleChallenge = function(response) {  * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.handleFailure = function(response) {  * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback = function(response) {  * \n * \n * \n * myChallengeHandler.handleChallenge(response); \n * \n * \n * \n * //hide the login screen, we are logged in \n   showMainScreen(); \n   myChallengeHandler.submitSuccess(); \n * \n\n}; \n\n//When the login button is pressed, submit a login form \n$(\"#loginButton\").click(function(){  * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * j_username: $(\"#username\").val(), \n   j_password: $(\"#password\").val(), \n   originalUrl : lastRequestURL, \n   login: \"Login\" \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * myChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback); \n\n}); \n\nIf you want to retrieve the LTPA key file used for authentication from the Worklight Server, you can also use the WL.Client.Login Worklight API function.  * \n\n\nThis call will trigger the myChallengeHandler.isCustomResponse method with a JSON response, where you can retrieve the LTPA key file.  * \n * response.responseJSON.WASLTPARealm.isUserAuthenticated) \n * \n\n\nFor any subsequent Adapter calls that need to be proxied through the reverse proxy, you can include this sessionKey as a header within the request. \n\nEnsure your HTML body for the Worklight application reflects the login information that DataPower will handle. The Worklight documentation and samples explain the use of authentication and customizing authentication (20-22). \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=3] \nIt can be as simple as the following: \n\n<div id= \"authPage\">  * \n * \n * \n * \"loginForm\"\n * \n *  Username:<br/> \n   <input type= \"text\" id= \"username\" autocorrect= \"off\" autocapitalize= \"off\"  * \n    * \"admin\"\n    * \n   \n   Password:<br/> \n   <input type= \"password\" id= \"password\" autocorrect= \"off\" autocapitalize= \"off\"  * \n    * \"admin\"\n    * \n   \n   <input type= \"button\" id= \"loginButton\" value= \"Login\" /> \n * \n\n</div> \n\n<div id= \"index\">  * \n\n</div> \n\n\nApplication-descriptor.xml \n\nThe Worklight documentation covers how to create both the client side app and the server side configuration files. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=4] \n\nIn order to have the authentication test added to an application or device, add a securityTest attribute to the environment's tag in the application-descriptor.xml in your project to use the WASTest-securityTest security test we created earlier in our authenticationConfig.xml on the server-side. Here is an iPad example: \n\n<ipad bundleId= \"com.Datapower\" securityTest= \"WASTest-securityTest\" version= \"1.0\">  * \n * \"true\"\n * \n * \n * \n * <encryptWebResources enabled= \"false\"/> \n   <testWebResourcesChecksum enabled= \"false\"  * \n    * \"png, jpg, jpeg, gif, mp4, mp3\"\n    * \n   \n   \n * \n\n</ipad> \n\nFor an iPhone example, your application descriptor may look like the following. \n\n<iphone bundleId= \"com.myappId\" version= \"1.3.3\" securityTest= \"WASTest-securityTest \">  * \n * \"true\"\n * \n * \n * \n * <encryptWebResources enabled= \"false\"/> \n   <testWebResourcesChecksum enabled= \"false\" ignoreFileExtensions= \"png, jpg, jpeg, gif, mp4, mp3\"/> \n * \n\n</iphone> \n\n\nDefine a MPGW on DataPower \n\nConfiguring a MPGW to terminate the secure network connection and enforce the authentication of an application as defined above follows the same steps. The steps and illustrations represent a subset of the configuration screens found in the DataPower GUI that are necessary to configure the MPGW for a mobile application. To configure the proxy we will need to configure the front-side and the back-end URL. \n\nStart with the General Configuration tab (See Figure 2). The items to be selected are indicated in the illustration below with blue arrows and include:  * Multi-Protocol Gateway Name: provide a name for your gateway \n * Set Response Type: Non-XML\n   This allows http Web application traffic, include JSON, JavaScript, CSS to pass through the appliance. \n * Set Request Type: Non-XML\n   This allows http web application request to be handled by appliance \n * Front Side Protocol: For the type of use case we describe we use an HTTPS handler. For this style of interaction the user credential will be passed between the client and server, so the transport should be protected using SSL protocol. \n * Multi-Protocol Gateway Policy: The Policy tab allows for additional configuration, and in this case we select '+' to add a new policy, which will contain the AAA policy. (This depends on the authentication method used. See section 3.a and 3.b for detail information on how to configure the appropriate policy.) \n * Backend URL: Specify the address and port of the Worklight server hosted on a WebSphere Application Server. (Given the credential, LTPA will be sent to the back-end, consider to use a SSL port, for this article, we will use an HTTP port.)\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=5] \n\nWhen creating a HTTPS front-side handler there are additional parameters to configure(see Figure 2.a and 2.b)  * Name: Provide a name for the handler (HTTPS) \n * Port Number: Choose an available port \n * Allowed Methods and Versions: Enable 'Get Method'\n   This enables support for HTTP Get. \n * SSL Proxy: Specify a SSL Reverse Proxy profile\n   This provides the identity for the SSL Server.\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&amp;aid=6] \nFigure 2.a : Select HTTPS(SSL) Front Side Handler\n\n\u2026... \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=7] \nFigure 2.b Configure HTTPS Front Side Handler\n\nThe next step is to configure the Policies that you want to be applied to the traffic. Select the \u201cGeneral\u201d Tab \u2192 Multi-Protocol Gateway Policy (by clicking '+'). In the policy section we need to configure a set of rules to be applied based on what actions the reverse proxy needs to enforce. DataPower allows the administrator to configure a policy, name it and then reuse it. This policy will handle both mobile web and mobile application traffic. \n\nHere we give two options. Option 1 is HTTP Basic Authentication. Option 2 is for forms based authentication. \n\nOption 1: Utilize HTTP Basic Authentication (see Figure 4) \n * Policy Name: Enter a policy name (\u201cworklight-basicauth\u201d), click \u201cApply Policy\u201d \n * Click \u201cNew Rule\u201d: (repeat this for 4 rules below, from top to bottom on Figure 4) \n * Rule 1 \u2013 When processing HTML content we want to skip processing with the icon associated with web site or web page (worklight-basicauth_rule_0)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d or \u201cBoth Directions\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = /favicon.ico \n    * Advanced: \u201cSet Variable\u201d \u2192 var://service/mpgw/skip-backside = 1 \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 2 \u2013 Since the policy will be applied to each request, the order of the rules needs to ensure that we first Verify a LTPA Token if it exists in the HTTPrequest (worklight-basicauth_rule_3). If there is no token, we then move to the next rule and authenticate the user (rule 3)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = http, HTTP Header Tag = Cookie, HTTP Value Match=*LTPAToken* \n    * AAA: VerifyLTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 3 \u2013 Handle the authentication of end user if LTPA Token does not exist (worklight-basicauth_rule_1)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = * \n    * AAA: BasicAuth2LTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 4 - Handle both the redirect and content-type reset (potentially), on the response side (worklight-basicauth_rule_2)  * Direction: \u201cServer to Client\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = * \n    * Filter: provides a custom style sheet which handles redirect and content-type rewrite (a sample style sheet, redirect.xsl, is provided with this article) redirect.xsl [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=9]redirect.xsl [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=8]\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n      \n   \n   \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=10] \nFigure 4: MPGW Style Policy for HTTP Basic Authentication Support \n\n\nOption 2: Utilize HTTP Form Based Login (see Figure 5) \n * Policy Name: Enter a policy name, (\u201cmpgw-form\u201d) click \u201cApply Policy\u201d \n * Click \u201cNew Rule\u201d: (repeat this for 5 rules below, from top to bottom on Figure 5) \n * Rule 1 \u2013 skip processing with the icon associated with web site or web page (mpgw-form_rule_0)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d or \u201cBoth Directions\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = /favicon.ico \n    * Advanced: \u201cSet Variable\u201d \u2192 var://service/mpgw/skip-backside = 1 \n    * Result \n   \n   \n * Rule 2 - Verify a LTPA Token if it exists in the http request (mpgw-form_rule_1)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = http, HTTP Header Tag = Cookie, HTTP Value Match=*LTPAToken* \n    * AAA: VerifyLTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 3 - Generate the HTML Form Login Page (mpgw-form_rule_2)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: Match with PCRE = on, \n      type = url, match pattern = /(Login|Error)Page\\.htm(l)?(\\?originalUrl=.*)? \n    * Transform: provides a custom style sheet which builds either a Login or Error html page.

      "F5; WebSphere Edge; BIG-IP; response; 301; 302; redirect TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM\nAccessing WebSphere Portal through certain proxies (or gateways) may result in incorrect location fields in 301 and 302 response headers. The proxy (or gateway) fails to rewrite the response header. The client cannot follow the 301 or 302 redirect.\n\nSYMPTOM\nThis technote addresses the following scenarios: \n\n1. You access WebSphere Portal via a proxy and navigate through the site. In response to some request, WebSphere Portal returns a 301 or 302 redirect with a location field like: \n\n \n\nhttp://proxy.ibm.com:10040/wps/... \n\n \n\nwhere 10040 is WebSphere Portal's internal port. Since the proxy is not listening on this port, when the browser tries to follow the redirect, the request fails. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. You access WebSphere Portal via an HTTPS proxy and navigate through the site. In response to some request, WebSphere Portal returns a 301 or 302 redirect with a location field like: \n\n \n\nhttp://proxy.ibm.com:80/wps/... \n\n \n\nSince the HTTPS proxy services requests on port 443 only, when the browser tries to follow the redirect, the request fails.\n\n\nCAUSE\nA proxy fails to rewrite the location field in the response header before redirecting the client. \n\n \n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) RFC 2616 specifies that the location field should be an absolute URI. WebSphere Portal uses getScheme(), getServerName(), and getServerPort(), as defined by the Java Servlet Specification, in constructing URLs to set in location fields. WebSphere Application Server (WAS) services getServerPort() according to its web server plug-in's AppServerPortPreference. \n\n \n\nThis approach assumes: \n\nA. Any non-direct requests must be made through a supported web server running the WAS plug-in. \n\nB. If WebSphere Portal is configured for HTTPS, the SSL pipe should terminate at a supported web server running the WAS plug-in.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nInspect the HTTP headers for requests and responses using a tool like Fiddler. If 301 or 302 redirects' location fields are unreachable, map the network to determine what proxies stand between the browser and WebSphere Portal. \n\n \n\nEnabling WebSphere Portal engine and WebSphere Application Server security and webcontainer traces may help you identify how the location field is constructed by providing the server's perspective (e.g. doGet request/response, getServerPort() call, HTTP header information): \n\n\ncom.ibm.wps.engine.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.security.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.webcontainer.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.wswebcontainer.*=all\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nEnsure that the assumptions A and B above have been met. If these conditions cannot be met, additional proxy rules may be required to route requests correctly. \n\n\nWork with proxy administrators to ensure that the proxy rewrites response headers' location fields, as needed, before forwarding 301 or 302 redirects.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n AppServerPortPreference (WAS) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/fep/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/uwsv_plugin_props1.html]\nIETF RFC 2616 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt]\nJava Servlet 2.4 Specification [http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr154/index.html]\nConfiguring SSL (6.1 InfoCenter) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v615/security/ssl_intro.html]\nConfiguring SSL (7.0 InfoCenter) [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_SSL_wp7]\nSupported web servers [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg27007791]\nFiddler [http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/]",

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

Session Timeout Configuration allows you to set the timeout period for IBM Cognos Now! as well as specify a specific timeout for a group of users. When the session timeout occurs, IBM Cognos Now! displays a pop-up screen that informs the user that the session has expired and allows the user to re-enter the user name and password. \n   \n   Note: Session timeout does not apply to a user logged in as Anonymous. \n   \n   The following are the settings for the session timeout:\n   \n   Default Session Timeout :\n   Specifies how long IBM Cognos Now! can be idle before users must log in again. Setting the default session timeout to 0 indicates that user sessions do not time out. The default is 60 minutes. \n   \n   Alternate Session Timeout :\n   Specifies how long IBM Cognos Now! can be idle before a specified list of users must log in again. The value that you specify for the alternate session timeout overrides the default session timeout for these users. Setting the alternate session timeout to 0 creates an infinite session for those users included in the user list for session timeout.

To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value.

This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file.

      "l2dce109 dcehint dcehintgeneral TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n DCE RPC Timeouts \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIntroduction \n\nSuppose I make a DCE RPC to a server that's unavailable. How long will it take for my RPC to time out and return a failure code? Sounds like a simple question, but unfortunately the answer is pretty complicated. The shortest possible correct answer is: it depends. The purpose of this note is to list the things that it depends upon, and to describe how you can control the timeout period if the default behavior doesn't meet your needs. \n\nVariables that Control Timeout\n\nThe following variables control how long an RPC timeout will take: \n\n1. Protocol sequence: UDP timeouts can be controlled much more easily from within DCE applications, and are more predictable. TCP timeouts are controlled by OS parameters and are not as predictable. Specifically... \n\n2. Nature of the dead server: this doesn't matter at all if you're making RPCs via UDP, but if you use TCP then it can make a dramatic difference. With TCP, if the target server machine is up but the specific target server process is down, then the timeout will be almost instantaneous. If however the entire target server machine is down or otherwise inaccessible (i.e., if the box cannot be pinged), then a TCP RPC may take several minutes to time out. In contrast, a UDP RPC will take about 35 seconds to time out, no matter what the nature of the dead server process or machine. Furthermore... \n\n3. User-adjustable timeout settings: that 35-second UDP timeout can be adjusted fairly easily, on a per-binding-handle basis, by a DCE application. Depending on the platform, you might even be able to adjust it via an environment variable. With TCP on the other hand, the multi-minute timeout for accesses to a dead server machine can be adjusted only on a per-client-machine basis -- -- that is, you have to adjust the machine's global TCP timeout in order to change it. Also... \n\n4. State of the connection: there will probably be different TCP timeout parameters to control initial connection timeouts and timeouts within an existing connection.\n\n\nProtocol Sequences: TCP and UDP\n\nProtocol sequence is the most important factor when analyzing DCE RPC timeouts. By default, a DCE server will be accessible via both TCP and UDP, and a client will choose randomly between the two protocols when transmitting an RPC. If the target server is up, then the choice of protocol is almost indistinguishable: both protseqs will exhibit the same behavior, even when faced with a lossy network connection that causes intermittent comm failures (rather than permanent ones). \n\nHowever, if the target server is truly down or is completely inaccessible, then the differences between RPCs made over TCP and those made over UDP can lead to puzzling behavior. If you do nothing special, then you'll see one of four different failure modes: \n\n1. If the RPC is made via UDP, then it will fail with a \"communications failure\" error after about 35 seconds \n\n2. If the RPC is made via TCP and the target machine is down and the client does not have an existing connection to the server, then it will fail with a \"connection request timed out\" error after several minutes (the exact time depends on the client machine's OS, as you'll see, but is typically 1 - 3 minutes) \n\n3. If the RPC is made via TCP and the target machine is down and the client has an existing connection to the server, then it will fail with a \"connection closed\" error after several minutes (this timeout will probably be significantly longer than the one in the previous bullet, like 8 or 9 minutes) \n\n4. If the RPC is made via TCP and the target machine is up but the target server is down, then it will fail with a \"connection request rejected\" error, usually in under 1 second.\n\nIn general, we recommend using UDP for RPCs if you have to control timeouts. Nevertheless, we'll discuss specifics for timeout control in both UDP and TCP in the remainder of this note. \n\n\nControlling UDP RPC Timeouts\n\nEvery DCE RPC is associated with a data structure called a \"binding handle\". The binding handle contains a set of control information about the RPC's destination, including the protseq to use (TCP or UDP), the IP address and port number of the target server, the object UUID for the RPC (in cases where object RPCs are used -- object UUIDs are an optional feature of DCE RPCs), and a communications timeout setting. We are mostly interested in the communications timeout setting in this section. \n\nThe comm timeout in the binding handle is a value from 0 to 10. Each DCE implementation is free to assign its own \"real-world\" meaning to these settings, subject to the following constraints: \n\n* A lower setting means a shorter timeout \n* Zero is the shortest \"reasonable\" timeout setting \n* Nine is the highest \"reasonable\" finite timeout setting \n* Ten means infinite timeout \n* The setting is considered to be advisory only, and the RPC runtime doesn't strictly have to pay any attention to it \n\nThat last one, the one about \"advisory only\", is the kicker with respect to TCP -- with TCP, the only thing the RPC facility cares about is: did you set it to ten? If so, then you get an infinite timeout. If not, then you get whatever the OS gives you -- so zero through nine is all the same to TCP. \n\nBut with UDP, the DCE RPC facility actually uses the comm timeout setting to decide how long to wait when making an RPC. The actual timeout values (in seconds) that correspond to each number from 0 to 9 are left up to the implementation, but the common rule seems to be that a timeout setting of N will be interpreted to mean 2^N + 3 seconds. This rule is approximately correct on both AIX and Solaris, for whatever it's worth. \n\nA programmer can use the rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout function to set the comm timeout on a particular binding handle. If this function is not called, then the default setting is 5, which usually corresponds to about 35 seconds. On Solaris, you can set the RPC_BINDING_TIMEOUT environment variable to change the default from 5 to something else. In any case, rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout, if called, has the final say. (When a binding handle is created, it is initialized with a timeout of 5, unless RPC_BINDING_TIMEOUT is set and you're on Solaris, in which case it's initialized with RPC_BINDING_TIMEOUT. After that, a programmer can set it to something else via rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout; you can even call rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout more than once to change the timeout from one RPC to the next. The current timeout setting in the binding handle controls the timeout absolutely for UDP RPCs.) \n\nYou can use our ping_string_binding sample program to investigate timeouts (available for download from the DCE Downloads link \"DCE / DFS Debugging Tools\"). This program takes a string binding as its command-line argument, and attempts to send a DCE \"ping\" RPC, rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening, to the server specified in the binding. The program uses rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout to set a timeout of 3, but you can adjust that easily if you want to play. \n\nFor example, using the value of 3, let's try to ping the DCE endpoint mapper on three machines: one whose endpoint mapper is up, one whose EP mapper is down, and one machine that doesn't even exist. The endpoint mapper process, dced, always listens on port 135, so we'll construct string bindings aimed at port 135 on the three machines: \n\n% ping_string_binding 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.15[135]'\nMon Jun 5 10:43:48 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.15[135]'...\nServer responded to ping in 68.2 milliseconds\n\n...\n\n\n% date; ping_string_binding 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.16[135]' ; date\nMon Jun 5 10:44:02 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.16[135]'...\nError: rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening returned 382312470\nCommunications failure (dce / rpc)\n\nDone.\nMon Jun 5 10:44:16 EDT 2000\n\n% ping 9.38.205.16\n9.38.205.16 is alive\n\n\n\n% date; ping_string_binding 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.99[135]' ; date\nMon Jun 5 10:44:33 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncadg_ip_udp:9.38.205.99[135]'...\nError: rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening returned 382312470\nCommunications failure (dce / rpc)\n\nDone.\nMon Jun 5 10:44:46 EDT 2000\n\n% ping 9.38.205.99\nno answer from 9.38.205.99\n\n%\n\nIn the above example, you first see a successful ping to the dced that's up. Then we have unsuccessful RPCs to the other two machines; both take close to our predicted value of 11 seconds to time out. There's some extra slop in the timings -- the UNIX date command isn't the most precise way to time a single function call -- but you can modify the program to get a more accurate time if you want to. Note that the UNIX ping command verifies that one of the unsuccessful DCE RPCs was directed to a machine that was up, and the other was directed to a machine that was not accessible, because I made up the IP address -- we have no machine here with an address of 9.38.205.99. \n\n\nControlling TCP RPC Timeouts (if you insist...)\n\nTCP RPC timeouts are primarily governed by OS parameters. If you set the binding handle timeout to 10, then you do get an infinite timeout with TCP, but that's the only case in which the binding handle timeout matters with TCP RPCs. We specifically discuss Solaris and AIX parameters in this note; presumably other operating systems will have similar mechanisms. \n\nWhen the OS tries to establish a TCP connection, it sends a message (specifically, a SYN packet) to the TCP module on the target machine, asking for a connection to a particular port. If there is no server listening on the specified port, then the remote TCP module responds that it can't make a connection, and the client process knows right away that it's doomed. This is why a TCP RPC that's aimed at a dead server on a live machine will fail almost instantly. For example, using the live machine from the above example: \n\n\n% date ; ping_string_binding 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.16[135]' ; date\nMon Jun 5 11:18:31 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.16[135]'...\nError: rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening returned 382312514\nConnection request rejected (dce / rpc)\n\nDone.\nMon Jun 5 11:18:33 EDT 2000\n\n%\n\n...and you can see that the DCE RPC failure was not delayed. Since the remote TCP module sends an immediate failure indicator (in the form of a RESET packet), the RPC facility knows that it's hopeless, so failure is almost immediate. (Astute observers will note that the same sort of thing can happen with UDP, sort of -- the remote machine might send an ICMP \"destination unreachable\" packet if a UDP RPC is aimed at a non-existent server on an available machine. DCE's UDP RPC module does not look for these ICMP messages though, so these UDP RPCs will not time out instantly -- rather, the DCE client will keep sending UDP packets to the server machine until the timeout period elapses .) \n\nAnyway, back to TCP... suppose now that the target machine itself is inaccessible. In this case, TCP can wait a very long time before giving up: \n\n\n% date ; ping_string_binding 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.99[135]' ; date\nMon Jun 5 11:23:56 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.99[135]'...\nError: rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening returned 382312513\nConnection request timed out (dce / rpc)\n\nDone.\nMon Jun 5 11:25:11 EDT 2000\n\nThe above was done on an AIX machine; on Solaris we have this: \n\n\n% date ; ping_string_binding 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.99[135]' ; date\nMon Jun 5 11:24:40 EDT 2000\n\nTrying to ping 'ncacn_ip_tcp:9.38.205.99[135]'...\nError: rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening returned 382312513\nConnection request timed out (dce / rpc)\n\nDone.\nMon Jun 5 11:27:50 EDT 2000\n\nSo we waited 1 minute 15 seconds on AIX, and 3 minutes 10 seconds on Solaris. How's come? Read on... \n\n\n...TCP Timeouts on AIX\n\nOn AIX, there's a parameter named tcp_keepinit, settable via the AIX no command. (The command name really is \"no\", meaning \"network options\", I suppose.) The default is 75 seconds; the settable units are half-seconds, so the default setting of tcp_keepinit is actually 150: \n\n\n# /usr/sbin/no -o tcp_keepinit\ntcp_keepinit = 150\n\nThe default 75-second timeout is what we saw in the AIX example above. \n\n\n...TCP Timeouts on Solaris\n\nOn Solaris, there's a parameter named tcp_ip_abort_cinterval, settable via the Solaris ndd command. The default is 3 minutes; the settable units are milliseconds, so the default setting of tcp_ip_abort_cinterval is actually 180000: \n\n# ndd /dev/tcp tcp_ip_abort_cinterval\n180000\n\nNow, this should lead to a timeout of 3 minutes; but we saw 3 minutes and 10 seconds in the example above... The discrepancy occurs on Solaris because of the way that the timeout interacts with the SYN packets sent by TCP. A SYN packet is sent in order to initiate a TCP connection to a remote machine. If no response is received to the first SYN packet, then another is sent 3 seconds later. If still no response, then another SYN is sent 6 seconds later, then 12 seconds after that, then again 24 seconds after that, and so on -- the delay time starts at 3 seconds and keeps doubling until tcp_ip_abort_cinterval has been exceeded. So, the SYN packets are sent at time 0, 3, 9, 21, 45, 93, 189, and so on. In our case, after 189 seconds (3 minutes 9 seconds), we had exceeded the tcp_ip_abort_cinterval timeout of 180 seconds, so TCP gave up. In contrast, we saw above that AIX doesn't care about the SYN packet timing -- it just cuts you off when tcp_keepinit says to cut you off. But on Solaris, the tcp_ip_abort_cinterv\nal timeout is checked only after each SYN packet times out. \n\nThe information above describes timeout characteristics that apply when a DCE client attempts to start a new conversation with a server. If on the other hand you're using TCP RPCs and a server process or machine goes down in the midst of an existing conversation, or if the server suddenly becomes inaccessible because of some network problem, then you will see different timeout characteristics. For example, on Solaris, the tcp_ip_abort_interval parameter comes into play, and that guy has a default setting of 480000, which means that an RPC timeout for an existing connection can take 8 minutes. The timing on AIX seems to be similar, maybe a touch longer, but I don't know if it's adjustable there. (Stevens' \"TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1\" book indicates that 9 minutes is a standard value for this timeout, so perhaps AIX uses that value and does not allow it to be adjusted?) \n\n\nSummary\n\nOur advice: use UDP, and consider use of rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout if you need fine control. \n\nThe timeout control that you get with TCP RPCs is pretty awful. It's just so much simpler with UDP... the only disadvantage is that in the case where the target machine is up but the target server process is down, the TCP timeout will be much quicker than the default UDP timeout. Still, the controllability and predictability of UDP timeouts usually far outweigh this one TCP advantage in our opinion. The only way to get comparable control with TCP RPCs would be to implement it yourself in your application client code, using a separate watchdog thread or setting up an alarm signal to monitor any threads that are making RPCs and to time out the RPC thread(s) via thread cancels if necessary.",

Is there any concern if sessions never time out? \n\nCAUSE\nI do not specify TIMEOUT limit in the RACF segment. The timeout limit is set at in the 3270 session manager (CA/TPX) and the value is 60 minutes. Since we specify SIGNOFF(LOGOFF) in the TYPETERM definitions, we expect that the session be signed off and logged off when TPX timeout expires. However, my business users would like to either extend the timeout value or not sign off the user.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIBM has no way of knowing what CA TPX does or how it works with a TIMEOUT feature, but TPX might emulate what happens if the TIMEOUT parameter is on the RACF CICS segment of the user \nprofile. However, CA Technologies would have to confirm this.\n\n\nThe way CICS works if the TIMEOUT parameter is on the RACF CICS segment of the user profile is as follows: \n\n\nIf RACF does not return the CICS segment data for a user, in other words there is no CICS segment for the user, then CICS uses the user attributes of the CICS default user, and if RACF does not return a CICS segment for the default user, then a TIMEOUT=0 is used.\n\nSince CICS assigns the operator data from the CICS segment of the default user to signed-on users who do not have their own CICS segment data, all you need is a CICS segment for the default userid with an appropriate TIMEOUT value specified. \n\n\nAt the CICS region level the SIGNOFF parameter in the TYPETERM definitions is used with your terminals. If you want the terminal to be logged off CICS when the timeout occurs it should specify SIGNOFF(LOGOFF). The CICS TS 5.2 documentation in section Automatic sign-off, logoff, and TCTTE deletion [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.resourcedefinition.doc/topics/dfha45r.html] gives a step by step breakdown of what happens in Figure 1: \n\nWhen a session is timed out because there is no terminal activity, CICS uses these steps to determine whether to delete an autoinstalled terminal definition:\n1. If no timeout is specified in the RACF segment, the user is not automatically signed off or logged off.\n\n\n2. If SIGNOFF(NO) is specified in the TYPETERM definition, the user is not automatically signed off or logged off.\n\n\n3. If SIGNOFF(YES) is specified in the TYPETERM definition, and a timeout is specified in the RACF segment, the user is signed off when the timeout period has expired.\n\nBefore the timeout period has expired, the user can resume terminal activity.\n\n\n4. If SIGNOFF(LOGOFF) is specified in the TYPETERM definition, and a timeout is specified in the RACF segment, the user is signed off and the terminal is logged off. The terminal definition is deleted after a further interval, which is specified in the AILDELAY attribute of the TYPETERM definition. \n\nBefore the timeout period has expired, the user can resume terminal activity. After the timeout has expired, but before the terminal definition is deleted, the user can log on again without the overhead of the autoinstall process.\n\n\n\nThere are three options: \n\n * SIGNOFF(NO)\n   The terminal is not timed out. \n * SIGNOFF(YES) \n   CICS signs off the operator from CICS, but the terminal remains connected. \n * SIGNOFF(LOGOFF)\n   CICS signs off the operator from CICS and logs off the terminal from z/OS Communications Server.\n   \n\n\nSo if you specify SIGNOFF(NO) CICS leaves the user signed on and the terminal remains logged on, effectively overriding the time-out period. With such a setting the storage of course is never freed until a actual signoff is performed.  \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CICS/TS CICS TS CICS Transaction Server",
      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n A problem occurs when TM1Web session is terminated after (x) minutes and user must login repeatedly.\nTM1Web session is terminated after 20 minutes with message \u201cSession timed out. Please login again\".\nTM1Web keeps timing out despite increasing TM1 Web Session Timeout. \n\nSYMPTOM\nERROR Applix.TM1.Web.Page.TM1WebPageUtils - <Your Web session has timed out. Please login again.> \n\n\nCAUSE\nTimeout parameter in web.config and IIS worker process are defined with Default Parameter. \n\n(Web Session Timeout=20 min, IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds=120 sec, IdleTimeout=20 min).\n\nTimeouts can be configured at three different \u201clevels\u201d (TM1Web & TM1 Server & MS IIS):\n1. TM1Web timeout settings \u2013 web.config, tm1web web app\n2. TM1 Server timeout settings \u2013 tm1s.cfg\n3. MS IIS settings for timeout of worker processes \u2013 IIS w3wp.exe + DefaultAppPool + machine.cfg\n\nThe setting in the tm1s.cfg file applies at the server level, while the web.config applies to accessing the virtual directory for TM1Web. \nThe IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds will disconnect a user's TM1 session, while the timeout parameter in the web.config only applies to a user's connection to the TM1Web website.\n\nProblem could also be caused as a result of having the Application pool that TM1Web is using setup to utilize Multiple Worker Processes. \n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nTM1 9.4 or 9.4.1 on MS Server 2003 with IIS6, 9.5 or 9.5.1 on MS Server 2003 with IIS6 or MS Server 2008 with IIS7\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nUnexpected timeouts may occur when Default Parameter is changed or \"Precedence of settings\" is causing unexpected behaviour. The setting in the web.config file takes precedence over idle timeout in IIS and machine.config. When timeout is missing in the web.config then the setting from machine.config takes precedence. \n\n\nIn Task Manager, if you see multiple w3wp.exe processes listed, this is an indication that the Application Pool being used by IIS is setup to use multiple worker processes (which is another possible cause of this problem, as there should only ever be one).\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo prevent a TM1Web session from timing out configure your Timeout Parameter according to business requirements and \u201cprecedence of timeout settings\u201d (best practice is not to change the default parameters). \n\n\nCheck web.config and tm1s.cfg file timeout parameter information. Check if you have a setting in your tm1s.cfg as it could be impacting your timeout if you do (note that no entry = never timeout). IdleConnectionTimeOut Seconds specifies a timeout limit for idle client connections, in seconds. For example, if you include the line IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds=900 in tm1s.cfg, the server disconnects idle client connections after 900 seconds.\n\nTimeout Parameter in TM1 & Microsoft IIS & TM1Web\n1. Increase timeout IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds (tm1s.cfg) from 900 sec to 7200 sec (= 120 min)\n2. Increase timeout of IIS worker process from sec (=20 min) to 7200 sec (= 120 min)\ncscript %SystemDrive%\\Inetpub\\AdminScripts\\adsutil.vbs set W3SVC/AppPools/ApplicationPoolName n\n3. Increase timeout DefaultAppPool from default 20 min to 120 min \n4. Increase timeout TM1 Web Session (web.config) from default 20 min to 120 min\n5. Restart IIS after changing timeout settings and restart the TM1 server if you modify the IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds parameter. \n\nAnother category of Session Timeouts, the ones where immediately after logon (or a short time later) the Session Timeout hits the user, is due to the default setting in IIS Version 6 webserver of MS Windows Server 2003 and IIS Version 7 webserver of MS Windows Server 2008: \nGo to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools ->IIS Manager -> Application Pool -> Default Application Pool (DefaultAppPool) [or whichever Application pool TM1Web is setup to use] -> right mouse click to open context menu, select Properties -> click the \"Performance\" tab -> Web Garden: Maximum number of worker processes -> Change from default value of 4 to 1.\n\nNote: The execution timeout in the web.config is not responsible for closing idle user sessions, it only controls how long IIS will wait to allow a large sheet/view to open. After this time there will be a message that the view timed out but this will not stop the user session. So this value only needs to be as long as the majority of views may take to render:\nhttpRuntime executionTimeout=\"180\" \n\nIf it is set too high it could hold up the system for a long time if a view is created that is simply too large to open. If it is set to something like 7200 it will hang up the user for 2 hours trying to open a view that may not ever open. Most customers prefer to only wait a few minutes for a view to open, so 120 - 300 is probably as high as it should be set. If working over a WAN where it is expected that the views will open slower, then it can be set to whatever setting works with the particular customer model (maybe 500 or 600). Use the parameter based on what works best for the model.",

This is correct because the JDBC driver that is installed with WebLogic 8.1 is Oracle JDBC driver 9.2.0.4.0. Do not attempt to upgrade the Database Driver.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I use a different driver other than the default driver? \n\nANSWER\nBy default the DB2\u00ae Content Manger V8.4 native API uses the JCC JDBC driver to connect to the server (on a DB2 database).\nIf you want to use a different driver from the default driver, you can use one of the following methods:\n\nMethod 1. \nSpecify values for the ICMJDBCDRIVER and ICMJDBCURL properties in the cmbicmsrvs.ini file as follows. \n\nICMSERVER=icmnlsdb\nICMSERVERREPTYPE=DB2\nICMSCHEMA=ICMADMIN\nICMSSO=FALSE\nICMDBAUTH=SERVER\nICMREMOTE=FALSE\nICMHOSTNAME=\nICMPORT=\nICMREMOTEDB=\nICMNODENAME=cmtest\nICMOSTYPE=AIX\nICMJDBCDRIVER=COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver\nICMJDBCURL=jdbc:db2:icmnlsdb\n\nMethod 2.\nDuring the data store connect API call, specify values for the JDBCDRIVER and JDBCURL properties as connect string options, as follows:\n\nDKDatastoreICM dsICM = newDKDatastoreICM();\nStringconnectString = JDBCDRIVER=COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver;JDBCURL=jdbc:db2:icmnlsdb\";\ndsICM.connect(database,userid,pw,connectString);\n\nIf the JDBCDRIVER and JDBCURL are specified by using both of these methods, then the connect string options always take precedence over the ini file entries.\n\nImportant: Even though you can specify any JDBC driver, only the JCC driver is supported in DB2 Content Manager V8.4.",
      "upgrade; bpm751; upgrade7x; database upgrade; oracle TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The upgrade7x command or the upgradeProcessData fails during the SIBus tables cleanup task while upgrading the Process Server database to IBM Business Process Manager \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen you run the upgrade7x command to upgrade the Process Server database, the script ends when it is cleaning the SIBus tables. For example: \n> upgrade_7x.sh -profileName myProfile -nodeName myNode -serverName myserver \n\nProcess Server database is now version 7.5.1. \n\nPerformance Data Warehouse database is now version 7.5.1. \n\nDatabase upgrade completed successfully. \n\nIBM Business Process Manager V7.5.1 Enterprise database upgrade program finished. \n\nLoading system data \n\nCleaning SIB tables \n\n \n\nThe following exception is seen in the upgrade log file, such as the C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\BPM\\Lombardi\\tools\\upgrade\\upgrade_7x\\logs file: \n\nJan 11, 2012 10:37:32 AM INFO: com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbupgrade.UpgradeDatabase - IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.1 Enterprise database upgrade program finished. \n\nJan 11, 2012 10:40:48 AM FINE: com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbclean.CleanDatabase - ORA-00942: table or view does not exist \n\njava.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:439) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:395) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.processError(T4C8Oall.java:802) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.receive(T4CTTIfun.java:436) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.doRPC(T4CTTIfun.java:186) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.doOALL(T4C8Oall.java:521) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CStatement.doOall8(T4CStatement.java:194) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CStatement.executeForDescribe(T4CStatement.java:853) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.executeMaybeDescribe(OracleStatement.java:1145) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithTimeout(OracleStatement.java:1267) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.executeQuery(OracleStatement.java:1469) \n\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatementWrapper.executeQuery(OracleStatementWrapper.java:389) \n\nat com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbclean.AbstractCleanDatabase.getUserTables(AbstractCleanDatabase.java:152) \n\nat com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbclean.AbstractCleanDatabase.clean(AbstractCleanDatabase.java:49) \n\nat com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbclean.CleanDatabase.clean(CleanDatabase.java:92) \n\nat com.lombardisoftware.tools.dbclean.CleanDatabase.main(CleanDatabase.java:176)\n\n\nCAUSE\nIf you are using a new profile to migrate from WebSphere Lombardi Edition or a previous IBM Business Process Manager version, you cannot reuse the messaging engine database due to the unique ID that is saved in the messaging engine database. The upgrade database command attempts to drop the SIB tables after upgrading the database. \n\nThe database user ID that is configured for the Messaging Engine Data Store for the Process Server and Performance Data Warehouse does not have enough privileges to delete the Messaging Engine tables.\n\nIf the user ID does not have privileges that are documented in the \"Installation privileges\" column in the Database Privileges [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_7.5.1/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rpln_db_privileges.html] topic within the information center, you see the previously listed exceptions during the database upgrade process. You can avoid the exceptions by adding the required \"installation\" privileges to the respective database users. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc%2Ftopics%2Frpln_db_privileges.html] \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you are unable to provide administrative privileges to the messaging engine data store database user before upgrading the database, take the following actions: \n\n * After you run the upgrade database command , check the appropriate log files.  * The IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.X log files are saved under the install_root\\BPM\\Lombardi\\tools\\upgrade\\upgrade_7x\\logs directory. \n    * The IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.1 Fix Pack 1 and later upgrade log files are saved under the profile_root/logs directory with a time stamp in the suffix. For example: upgradeProcessData_serverName_Thu-May-02-12.38.31-GMT-2013_0.log\n   \n   \n\nMake sure there are no other errors during the database upgrade and the system data loading processes. If you see exceptions only during the \"cleaning SIB tables,\" take one of the following actions: \n\n * If you are upgrading the same profile or a cluster (an in-place upgrade or after installing interim fixes ), you can ignore the failure because the messaging engine database can be reused. It is not necessary to truncate the SIB tables. \n * If you are migrating, you have created a new profile, and you are reusing the existing database, you have to truncate all the rows from the SIB tables that are used for previous Process Server and Performance Data Warehouse components.\n\n\nYou might encounter a problem starting the Messaging Engine if the database user is unable to recreate the tables. Refer to the Messaging Engine does not start after upgrading to a new version [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635822] document to resolve the start up problems.

      "BPMConfig; profile; path; directory TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do you specify the profile path in the configuration properties file for IBM Business Process Manager so you can use it with the BPMConfig command? \n\nANSWER\nNote: The information that is contained in this document has been moved to dW Answers at this location [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/171346/how-do-you-specify-the-profile-path-with-bpmconfig.html]. The new format will allow you to ask questions of the community to better understand the information. This technote will be archived in 60 days. Please bookmark the new location.\n\nYou can use the following property names: \n\n * For a Deployment Manager profile: bpm.dmgr.profilePath \n * For a Custom profile: bpm.de.node.#.profilePath\n\n\nFor example: \nbpm.dmgr.profilePath=/usr/IBM/bpm85/profiles/DmgrProfile \nbpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:\\\\Program Files\\\\WebSphere\\\\profiles\\\\MyCustomProfile1  \n\nFor Microsoft Windows, you can use double backslashes or forward slashes. For example: \n\nbpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:/Program Files/WebSphere/profiles/MyCustomProfile1 \n\n \n\nNote: If you are creating the profile makes sure a profilePath value does not exist. The parent directory of the profile path should exist and the user should have write privileges to create a new directory. \n\n\nFor example, if you want to create a profile under the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory. Create the/usr/BPM850profiles directory, but do not create the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n BPMConfig command: sample configuration properties file [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/samplecfgprops.html]\n\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Installation / Configuration AIX, Linux, Linux zSeries, Solaris, Windows 8.5 \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n BPM"

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The pages called \"Creating a stand-alone profile manually,\" \"Creating a deployment manager profile manually,\" and \"Creating a custom profile manually\" were incorrect when the online Information Center was refreshed for the 6.2.0.3 release. They contained tables and examples that used the \"wbmDB\" prefix for the database parameters. The \"wbmDB\" prefixes should be replaced with \"db\" for the correct database parameters. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe correct pages are provided below.\nCreating a stand-alone profile manually\nCreating a deployment manager profile manually\nCreating a custom profile manually\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATING A STAND-ALONE PROFILE MANUALLY\n\nInstead of using the Profile Management Tool, you can use the manageprofiles command to create an application server (or stand-alone) profile from the command line. For 64\u2013bit platforms, you must create the profiles manually because the Profile Management Tool is not supported. \n\n1. Open a command prompt, and navigate to the following directory: \n\n app_server_root/bin \n\n2. Run the manageprofiles.bat or manageprofiles.sh command using the provided parameters. \n\nTable 1. Parameters for stand-alone profiles. Parameter and Value Required? Description Comments -create Required for profile creation Create a profile. Do not use for profile augmentation. -augment Required for profile augmentation Augment an existing profile. Do not use for profile creation. -templatePath app_server_root/profileTemplates /wbmonitor/default Required The location of the WebSphere Business Monitor template for stand-alone profiles. -profileName profile_name Required for profile augmentation The name of the profile. A default name is supplied for profile creation if you do not provide one. -cellName cell_name Required for profile augmentation The cell name of the profile. The default is the cell name of the profile as defined by WebSphere Application Server. -nodeName node_name Required for profile augmentation The node name of the profile. The default is the node name of the profile as defined by WebSphere Application Server. Monitor Database configuration -dbType DERBY_EMBEDDED | DB2_Universal | DB2UDBOS390_V8_1 | Oracle10g Optional The type of database. The default value for stand-alone profiles is DERBY_EMBEDDED. Use DB2_Universal for connecting to DB2. \n\nUse DB2UDBOS390_V8_1 for connecting to DB2 for z/OS. \n\nUse Oracle10g for connecting to either Oracle 10g or Oracle 11g. If you are using Oracle 11g, make sure that the JDBC driver path contains the Oracle 11g JDBC driver, ojdbc5.jar.\n\n-dbCreateNew true|false Optional If you ignore this parameter or set the value to true, a local database is created on the machine where the profile is created. If you set the value to false, the database and all required tables are not created during the installation. You can use existing tables that have been created previously, or you can use the database scripts to create the database and tables manually. The default value is true. The DDLs are generated regardless of the value of this parameter.\n\nNote: If the database server contains multiple versions of DB2 installed, or multiple DB2 instances, profile creation will use the server's default DB2 version or instance. To control which DB2 version or instance is used, set this parameter to false and use the \"Installing the database manually\" procedure so that the database administrator can ensure that the proper DB2 version or instance is used. -dbOutputScriptDir database_output_script_directory Optional The directory where the DDLs will be created. The generated DDLs can be run manually on the database server. The default value is profile_root/dbscripts/Monitor -dbSchemaName database_schema_name Optional The name of the schema. The default value is MONITOR. If you are using Oracle, the dbSchemaName and dbUserId must be set to the same value. \n\nIf you are using DB2 on z/OS, the WebSphere Business Monitor database schema name must be different from the WebSphere Process Server common database schema name to prevent collisions between database objects.\n\n-dbName database_name Optional The name of the database. For DB2, the default value is MONITOR. If you are using Oracle, it should be set to the Oracle SID. \n\n-dbUserId database_user_name Required if dbType is not DERBY_ EMBEDDED The user name to access the database.

If dbType is set to DERBY_EMBEDDED, the default value is app_server_root/derby/lib. If dbType is set to DB2_Universal or DB2UDBOS390_V8_1, the default value is app_server_root/universalDriver.wbm/lib. Otherwise, there is no default value and you must provide one. -dbHostName host_name Required if dbType is not DERBY_ EMBEDDED The host name for the database server. The default value is localhost. -dbServerPort port_number Required if dbType is not DERBY_ EMBEDDED The port where the TCP/IP service is assigned or the port on which the database is listening. The following values are the defaults, based on the value of dbType: o DERBY_EMBEDDED - none \n\no DB2_Universal - 50000 \n\no DB2UDBOS390_V8_1 - 8070 \n\no Oracle10g - 1521\n\n-dbDriverType 2 | 4 Required if dbType is set to Oracle10g The driver type for the database. For an Oracle database, specify either 2 or 4. A value of 2 corresponds to the OCI driver and a value of 4 corresponds to the Thin driver. -dbSysUserId system_user_name Required if dbType is set to Oracle10g and dbCreateNew is set to true. The name for the Oracle database administrator. This user must have access to create and drop databases and users. This parameter is not required if dbCreateNew is false and the database will be created at a later time. -dbSysPassword system_password Required if dbType is set to Oracle10g and dbCreateNew is set to true The password for the Oracle database administrator. This parameter is not required if dbCreateNew is false and the database will be created at a later time. -dbSubsystem connection_location Required for DB2 for z/OS The location of the DB2 for z/OS database. This value is used to create the database tables and the data source. This parameter applies only to DB2 for z/OS.\nNo spaces are allowed in the value. -dbStorageGroup storage_group_name Required for DB2 for z/OS The storage group of the WebSphere Business Monitor database for z/OS. This value is used to create the database tables. This parameter applies only to DB2 for z/OS. Common Event Infrastructure Database configuration -ceiDbProduct CEI_DB_DERBY_EMBEDDED | CEI_DB_DB2 | CEI_DB2_ZOS | CEI_DB_ORACLE Optional The database product used for the CEI event database. The default value for stand-alone profiles is CEI_DB_DERBY_EMBEDDED. Use CEI_DB_DB2 for DB2. \n\nUse CEI_DB2_ZOS for connecting to DB2 for z/OS. \n\nUse CEI_DB_ORACLE for connecting to either Oracle 10g or Oracle 11g.\n\n-ceiOutputScriptDir output_script_directory Optional The location for the generated database configuration scripts, which you can use to manually configure the event database at any time. -ceiDbName database_name Optional The name of the CEI event database to be created. For DB2 and Derby databases, the default value is event if not specified. For Oracle databases, the Oracle System Identifier (SID) must have been already created and available for the event service command to create the tables and populate the tables with data. The default value is orcl if not specified.\n\n-ceiDbExecuteScripts true|false Optional If you ignore this parameter or set the value to true, this command generates and runs the DDL CEI event database configuration scripts. The default is true. To create the database automatically, the system must already be configured to run the database commands. Use false if you plan to create the CEI database manually or if you already have one. \n\nIf this parameter is set to false, the scripts are generated but are not run. You must then run the database configuration scripts to complete the database configuration.\n\n-ceiOverrideDataSource true|false Optional If you set the value to true, this command removes any existing CEI service data source at the specified scope before creating a new one. When this parameter is ignored or the value is set to false, the command does not create an event service data source at the specified scope if another event service data source is found at the same scope. The default value is false. -ceiDbUser user_name Required for DB2 and Oracle databases, and for Derby databases if WebSphere domain security is enabled The user name for the CEI event database. For Derby databases, the default is the WebSphere Application Server user name if security is enabled, and blank otherwise. For DB2 databases, the default value is db2inst1. \n\nFor Oracle databases, this user ID specifies the Oracle schema user ID that will own the event service Oracle tables. The user ID is created during the database creation and the WebSphere data source uses this user ID to authenticate the Oracle database connection. The default value is ceiuser if not specified.\n\n-ceiDbPassword password Required if ceiDbUser was specified The password for the ceiDbUser. The ceiDbPassword is required for all databases except Derby. With Derby Network Server, ceiDbPassword is required if administrative security is enabled. For Oracle databases, this parameter is the password of the schema user ID, created during the database creation. The WebSphere data source uses this password to authenticate the Oracle database connection.\n\n-ceiJDBCClassPath JDBC_classpath Required for DB2 andOracle databases For Oracle, and DB2 databases, the path to the JDBC driver for CEI. Specify only the path to the driver file; do not specify the file name. For DB2, the default value is app_server_root/universalDriver.wbm/lib.\n\n-ceiDbHostName host_name Required for DB2 andOracle databases The host name of the machine where the CEI event database server is installed. -ceiDbPort port_nmber Optional The port number of the CEI event database instance. For DB2 databases, the default value is 50000 if not specified. For Oracle, the default value is 1521 if not specified.\n\n-ceiDbNodeName node_name Optional The DB2 node name (must be eight characters or less) for CEI. You must supply this parameter only if you have a remote DB2 database instance (node) cataloged and you want to create the remote database (ceiDb Execute Scripts is set to true) This node must be already cataloged and configured to communicate with the DB2 server. Monitor Messaging Engine configuration -msFileStore true|false Optional If you set the value to true, a file store is used for the message store. A file store is a message store that uses files in a file system through the operating system. This option is not available if you are using a clustered environment. Otherwise, the default value is true if the database type is any of the DB2 types, and false otherwise. -msDataStore true|false Optional If you set the value to true, a data store is used for the message store. A data store is a message store that contains a set of tables that are accessible to all members of the cluster that hosts the messaging engine. The default is false if the database type is any of the DB2 types, and true otherwise. -dataStoreDefaultDataSource true|false Optional If you set the value to true, a default Derby-based datasource is created. -dataStoreExistingDataSource true|false Optional If you set the value to true, an existing datasource is used for the data store. The default value is false. -dataStoreJndiName JNDI_name Required if dataSource Existing DataSource is true The JNDI name of the existing datasource to use. -dataStoreSchemaName schema_name Required if dataSource Existing DataSource is true The schema name of the existing datasource to use.

This value is used to create the database tables. This parameter applies only to DB2 for z/OS. Back to top\n\n\n\nCREATING A CUSTOM PROFILE MANUALLY\nInstead of using the Profile Management Tool, you can use the manageprofiles command to create a custom profile from the command line. For 64\u2013bit platforms, you must create the profiles manually because the Profile Management Tool is not supported. \n\n1. Open a command prompt, and navigate to the following directory: \n\n app_server_root/bin \n\n2. Run the manageprofiles.bat or manageprofiles.sh command using the provided parameters. \n\n \n\nTable 3. Parameters for custom profiles. Parameter and Value Required? Description Comments -create Required for profile creation Create a profile. Do not use for profile augmentation. -augment Required for profile augmentation Augment an existing profile. Do not use for profile creation. -templatePath app_server_root/profileTemplates/wbmonitor/managed Required The location of the WebSphere Business Monitor template for custom profiles. -profileName profile_name Required for profile augmentation The name of the profile. A default name is supplied for profile creation if you do not provide one. -cellName cell_name Required for profile augmentation The cell name of the profile. The default is the cell name of the profile as defined by WebSphere Application Server. -nodeName node_name Required for profile augmentation The node name of the profile. The default is the node name of the profile as defined by WebSphere Application Server. Federating a custom profile -federateLater true | false Optional If you set this parameter to true, you can federate the node later using the add_node command. See Add managed nodes in the WebSphere Application Server information center for more information. -dmgrAdminUserName user_name Required if administrative security is enabled on the deployment manager If administrative security is enabled on the deployment manager, specify a valid user name. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446598&amp;aid=1] -dmgrAdminPassword password Required if administrative security is enabled on the deployment manager If administrative security is enabled on the deployment manager, specify the password for the user name. -dmgrHost dmgr_host_name Required The machine where the deployment manager is running. The host name can be the long or short DNS name or the IP address of the deployment manager machine. The default value is localhost. Specify a properly formed host name containing no special characters. \n\nSpecifying this parameter directs the manageprofiles command to attempt to federate the custom node into the deployment manager cell as it creates the custom profile with the -templatePath parameter. The -dmgrHost parameter is ignored if you are creating a deployment manager profile or a stand-alone profile. \n\nIf you federate a custom node when the deployment manager is not running or is not available because of security being enabled or for other reasons, the installation indicator in the logs is INSTCONFFAIL to indicate a complete failure. The resulting custom profile is unusable. You must move the custom profile directory out of the profile repository (the profiles installation root directory) before creating another custom profile with the same profile name.\n\n-dmgrPort dmgr_port_number Required The SOAP port of the deployment manager. The default value is 8879. The value must be a positive integer. \n\nSpecify this parameter and the -dmgrHost parameter to federate a custom profile as it is created. The deployment manager must be running and accessible. \n\nA connection to the deployment manager must be available in conjunction with the -dmgrHost parameter.\n\nMonitor Database configuration -dbType DB2_Universal | DB2UDBOS390_V8_1 | Oracle10g Optional The type of database. Use DB2_Universal for connecting to DB2. Use DB2UDBOS390_V8_1 for connecting to DB2 for z/OS. \n\nUse Oracle10g for connecting to either Oracle 10g or Oracle 11g. If you are using Oracle 11g, make sure that the JDBC driver path contains the Oracle 11g JDBC driver, ojdbc5.jar.\n\n-dbJDBCClasspath database_jdbc_classpath Required if dbType is set to Oracle10g The path to the JDBC driver for the database. If dbType is set to DB2_Universal or DB2UDBOS390_V8_1, the default value is app_server_root/universalDriver.wbm/lib. Otherwise, there is no default value and you must provide one. Back to top",

The new format will allow you to ask questions of the community to better understand the information. This technote will be archived in 60 days. Please bookmark the new location.\n\nYou can use the following property names: \n\n * For a Deployment Manager profile: bpm.dmgr.profilePath \n * For a Custom profile: bpm.de.node.#.profilePath\n\n\nFor example: \nbpm.dmgr.profilePath=/usr/IBM/bpm85/profiles/DmgrProfile \nbpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:\\\\Program Files\\\\WebSphere\\\\profiles\\\\MyCustomProfile1  \n\nFor Microsoft Windows, you can use double backslashes or forward slashes. For example: \n\nbpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:/Program Files/WebSphere/profiles/MyCustomProfile1 \n\n \n\nNote: If you are creating the profile makes sure a profilePath value does not exist. The parent directory of the profile path should exist and the user should have write privileges to create a new directory. \n\n\nFor example, if you want to create a profile under the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory.

What shall we do to avoid this?\n\nWe got a Guardium stap of version 10 installed on an AIX server with Oracle Database. \n\nWe got an active/passive cluster node.\n\nWe see this error in the OS log:\n\nroot@bagheera01: / # errpt -a -j 4A20258F \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- \nLABEL: INIT_RAPID \nIDENTIFIER: 4A20258F \n\nDate/Time: Fri Jun 10 16:25:47 AST 2016 \nSequence Number: 5243 \nMachine Id: 00D189056D00 \nNode Id: bagheera01 \nClass: S \nType: TEMP \nWPAR: Global \nResource Name: init \n\nDescription \nSOFTWARE PROGRAM ERROR \n\nProbable Causes \nSOFTWARE PROGRAM \n\nUser Causes \nPERFORMANCE DEGRADED \n\nRecommended Actions \nREVIEW DETAILED DATA \n\nDetail Data \nSOFTWARE ERROR CODE \n\nCOMMAND \nid: utap \"/oradump/guardium/guardium/guard_stap/guard_stap \n/oradump/guardium/gu \nroot@bagheera01: / # Command is respawning too rapidly. Check for possible errors. \n\nANSWER\nWhen the server start the stap will try to find the db-server in this case a running oracle binary. If the stap fails to find a running oracle binary it will stop/abend and then immediately automatically start again. So it will restart over and over again until it finds a running oracle binary.\nTo avoid this do this:\n-\nFirst avoid to core dump the stap, if stap stop in this way we don't want a coredump unless we want to debug a stap problem. \n-\nAlso if stap configuration been tested successfully before you can configure stap to start and wait for db-server to start, instead of stopping. Also this will avoid the error/message above. To configure that set:\nwait_for_db_exec=1 in guard_tap.ini both on active and passive cluster node.\n\nShort explanation about wait_for_db_exec configuration parameter:\nwait_for_db_exec=-1 <--- This setting will cause stap to start and stop if db-server/oracle is not running. I recommend you use this only when you initially are testing the inspection engine settings.\nwait_for_db_exec=1 <--- With this setting stap will start and wait for db-server to start. The 1 is telling the stap to check every second if db-server started. If you set 2 it will check every 2 seconds etc. If for some other reason the stap will stop/abend it will still start again automatically.",

    "question": "Why am I getting an OutOfMemory error when running a simulation from a Decision Center, especially since I plan to submit a much larger number of scenarios, and I noticed that the records in a column of the Decision Warehouse are quite long?",
    "gold_doc": [
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When running a Decision Validation Service scenario suite in Rule Team Server can the optional trace be filtered to reduce its size ? \n\nANSWER\nIt is possible to customize the Decision Warehouse (DW) trace that is used by the Scenario Suite Provider (SSP) when a Decision Validation Service (DVS) scenario suite is executed in Rule Team Server. The customization can filter out information that is not necessary to keep in the DW. A sample implementation is provided that removes information about all the rules that are not fired, which helps keep the size of the trace small when there is a large number of rules in the ruleset and typically a much smaller number of rules actually fire. Also, only the DW persisted trace is smaller, the original larger trace is still used by DVS to perform the tests involved in the scenario suite. \n\nInstructions: \n\n 1. Unjar the attached jrules-ssptrace-src.jar to a local directory \n 2. Edit the file ./jrules-ssptrace/build.xml and modify the properties to reflect your environment setup ( in particular the jrules.home directory path, the sspInput and sspOutput file paths ) \n 3. Using a command line from the directory ./jrules-ssptrace execute: ant repackage-ssp \n 4. Deploy the customized SSP (available as the sspOutput file path) \n\n\njrules-ssptrace-src.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438208&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438208&aid=1] \n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5"

Which launchpad should I use?\nAnswer: The type of launchpad does not determine whether you install a 64-bit Decision Center. The type of launchpad determines whether the launchpad runs in 64 bits. The launchpad installs a 32-bit JVM and Eclipse for the Rule Designer. In custom mode, you can select whether you want to install WebSphere Application Server for the sample as a 32-bit or a 64-bit operating system. In typical mode, the WebSphere Application Server installation is silent and chooses the version that matches the operating system.\n\n\n\nFAQ: How can I run the launchpad on a Linux system?\nAnswer: Before starting the launchpad, open a shell and enter the following commands: \n\n * \n   cd disk1\n   find . -name \\*.sh -exec chmod +x {} \\;\n   chmod +x IM/install\n   chmod +x IM/installc\n   chmod +x IM/jre_6.0.0.sr9_20110208_03/jre/bin/java*\n   chmod +x WXS/install\n   chmod +x WXS/WXS/install*\n   \n\n\nTo start the launchpad, enter the following command: ./launchpad.sh\n\n\n\nFAQ: Why do I get MD5 checksum errors during the installation of WebSphere Operational Decision Management V7.5?\nAnswer: Errors can occur if you extract the installation TAR file by using the WinZip product. When WinZip extracts a TAR file, it converts UNIX and Linux formatted files into Windows format. As a result, the text files in the WebSphere Operational Decision Management TAR file are modified during the extraction and are found to have an incorrect MD5 checksum. \n\nTo resolve this issue, configure WinZip:\n\n1. Open WinZip.\n2. Click Options > Configuration, and click the Miscellaneous tab.\n3. Clear the TAR file smart CR/LF conversion check box. \n4. Extract the TAR file.\n\nFor more information about using WinZip, see the item about TAR file smart CR/LF conversion in the WinZip Knowledge Base at http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm [http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm].\n\nAlternatively, you can extract the installation TAR file by using a different product, such as 7-Zip.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nUsage \n\nThe following problems and answers refer to usage. \n\n\n \nFAQ: Where can I find information about using Decision Center?\nAnswer: See the Decision Center V7.5 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dcenter/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_Decision_Center2309.html].\n\n\n \nFAQ: Where is Rule Team Server?\nAnswer: Decision Center is replacing Rule Team Server. Decision Center contains the same features as Rule Team Server and much more. See What's new in Decision Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dcenter.overview/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_DC_Overview2876.html]. \n\n\n\nFAQ: Where is Decision Validation Services?\nAnswer: Testing and Simulation provided by Decision Validation Services in JRules BRMS 7.1 is now fully integrated in Decision Center. The execution side of Decision Validation Services is now included in Decision Server for Rules.\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I get started using Decision Center?\nAnswer: See Getting started with business rules [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dcenter.bu.gsrules%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2F_pubskel%2FInfocenter_Primary%2Fps_DCBU_Getting_started_Rules2313.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: Are there tips for using business rules to mine business rules test scenarios?\nAnswer: Yes. See BPM Voices: Using business rules to mine business rules test scenarios [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/bpmjournal/1106_col_berlandier/1106_berlandier.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How can I address \"The host appears to be running but port '-1' does not respond\" error?\nAnswer: See \"The host appears to be running but port \"-1\" does not respond. \" error when testing connection to Rule Execution Server from Decision Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21679679].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I configure Ant tasks to connect to Decision Center over HTTPS?\nAnswer: See Configure ANT tasks to connect to Rule Execution Server and Decision Center over HTTPS [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21677726]\n\n\nBack to op\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting \n\nThe following problems and answers refer to troubleshooting. \n\n\n\nFAQ: The installation failed with an WAS\\AppServer\\java\\docs\\autorun.inf (access is denied) error. How can I resolve this problem to install Decision Center?\nAnswer: This error occurs if you try to install Decision Center on a drive that is not C and you have an anti-virus software, such as Symantec Endpoint Protection, installed. To protect your system from attacks, some anti-virus security policies prevent tools from writing autorun.inf files on drives other than C. To complete the installation, install Decision Center on C or disable this policy temporarily. For more information about disabling the policy, see your anti-virus software's documentation or speak with your IT department.\n\n\n\nFAQ: Where can I find support information about Decision Center?\nAnswer: See WebSphere Operational Decision Management Support home [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Operational_Decision_Management]. \n\n\n \nFAQ: Where can I find a list of limitations and issues that exists in Decision Center?\nAnswer: See Known limitations in WebSphere Operational Decision Management V7.5 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516969].\n\n\n\nFAQ: I have an installation of WebSphere Application Server 7.0, update 15 or later, that I want to reuse with Decision Center; however, Installation Manager does not recognize the WebSphere Application Server installation and cannot install Business Space.\n\n\nI receive the following error: \n\n\nThe installation package 'IBM Business Space powered by WebSphere' requires components supplied by other packages. The required components might be supplied by the following installation packages: \nPackage: WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.15\n\n\nHow can I continue the installation? \nAnswer: Most likely, you did not use Installation Manager to install your instance of WebSphere Application Server and, therefore, Installation Manager is not aware of this installation. You must import the installation into Installation Manager. In the main menu of Installation Manager, click Import and follow the instructions in the wizard. For more information, see Import installed packages in Installation Manager [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/t_import_pkg.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: When I try to run the launchpad on a Linux system, the installer fails. How do I resolve this problem?\nAnswer: The installer fails because the \"x\" permission for executable files is not preserved. Before starting the launchpad, open a shell and enter the following commands:\n\n \n\n * cd disk1\n * \n * find . -name \\*.sh -exec chmod +x {} \\;\n * \n * chmod +x IM/install\n * \n * chmod +x IM/installc\n * \n * chmod +x IM/jre_6.0.0.sr9_20110208_03/jre/bin/java*\n * \n * chmod +x WXS/install\n * \n * chmod +x WXS/WXS/install*\n\nTo start the launchpad, enter the following command: ./launchpad.sh\n\n\n\nFAQ: I am having performance or memory-consumption issues when I use Decision Center. How can I resolve the problems?\nAnswer: If you experience performance issues when working with Decision Center in V7.5, see Improve Performance of Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584855]. \nThe technote addresses performance issues when logging in, editing, synchronizing, extracting rulesets, and conducting DVS tests, and has recommendations for installation. \n\nFor memory-specific issues, see Memory issues while using Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430582], and for more specific performance recommendations on ruleset extraction, seeImprove Performance of Ruleset Extraction from Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590218].\n\n\n\nFAQ: Why are native-encoded characters in project item names replaced by question marks in Decision Center?\nAnswer: See the troubleshooting technote Why are native-encoded characters in project item names replaced by question marks in Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640655]. \n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I resolve the error \"Insufficient permissions to install Decision Center\" when trying to access the Installation Settings Wizard through the console?\nAnswer: See the troubleshooting technote Insufficient permissions to install Decision Center (ODM) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678241].\n\n\n\nFAQ: After I install Decision Center, why can't I access the Decision Center console?\nAnswer: See the troubleshooting technote Cannot access Decision Center or Rule Execution Server console (ODM) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678244].\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n FAQ - Business Space powered by WebSphere [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27020117]\nFAQ - IBM Business Monitor [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27017940]\nFAQ - IBM Business Process Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021829]\nFAQ - WebSphere Business Compass [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27017900]\nFAQ - WebSphere Integration Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27016440]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG Decision Validation Services [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023725]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023695]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG JRules [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023694]\nFAQ - WebSphere Decision Server Rules [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023696]\nFAQ - WebSphere Decision Server Events [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023697]\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n IBM WebSphere Decision Center",
      "DVS; RES; trace TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Explains the possible reasons and solutions when getting the message \"Cannot retrieve execution traces on server <your server>\" in the results page of a Decision Validation Services (DVS) test suite execution. \n\nSYMPTOM\nThe test suite is successful and returns the test results specified in the Excel scenario file, but the message \"Cannot retrieve execution traces on server <your server>\" shows in the results page, and the additional trace information requested in the run page is not available.\n\n\nCAUSE\nIn addition to testing the results of your executions (defined in your Excel scenario file), DVS offers the possibility of retrieving additional trace information on the tests being run.\n\nThis is done by checking any of the following options in the run page for your test suite/simulation: \n\n * Create an Excel file separate from the report to store the output values \n * The list of rules fired \n * The list of executed ruleflow tasks \n * The duration (in ms) of execution\n\n\nThese options require Decision Warehouse (DW) to be set up and functional in your environment. The information you request is generated and stored in DW and retrieved from there.\n\nThe message \"Cannot retrieve execution traces on server <your server>\" indicates that Decision Center is unable to retrieve that trace information from DW.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for Decision Warehouse trace entries in the Rule Execution Server console for your test scenarios.\n\nYou will need to search by date/time in the Decision Warehouse tab of the Rule Execution Server console since the Decision ID and ruleset version are automatically generated with UUIDs. This means that you will also need to match the date and time to identify the traces corresponding to your DVS tests. See the documentation at Decision Server V8.0 > Decision Server Rules > Rule Execution Server Console online help > Monitoring and managing Decision Warehouse > Viewing trace information [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.console/topics/tsk_rescons_dw_trace_view.html].\n\nReview the logs for the target server for your DVS tests. The name of the target server is mentioned in the error message. This is the server that hosts the Rule Execution Server executing the DVS tests.\n\nIf no trace for your DVS tests is saved in DW and nothing relevant shows in the server logs to explain why the trace is not logged, refer to technote Obtaining debug information during Decision Warehouse trace capture [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278] to activate some trace for DW.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf the trace is not logged and you need that additional trace when running your tests, you will need to ensure that Decision Warehouse is properly setup to log the trace for your DVS tests. \n\nYou can refer to technote Decision Warehouse query does not return any data for ruleset executions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424948] for troubleshooting DW issues that prevent the trace from being saved.\n\nIf the trace is properly logged, you will need to ensure that the target server hosting Rule Execution Server has sufficient memory to retrieve that trace.\n\nAlternatively, you can also reduce the size of the trace, depending on what you need to retrieve when running your tests, as explained in technote Reducing the size of Decision Warehouse trace when running scenario suites [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438208].\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#ODM V8.0.1 doc for Decision Validation Services [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.overview/topics/tpc_testing_dvs.html]\nODM V8.0.1 doc for Decision Warehouse [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tpc_decision_warehouse.html]\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES / RES) Platform Independent 7.1, 7.0",

Which launchpad should I use?\nAnswer: The type of launchpad does not determine whether you install a 64-bit Decision Server. The type of launchpad determines whether the launchpad runs in 64 bits. The launchpad installs a 32-bit JVM and Eclipse for the Rule Designer. In custom mode, you can select whether you want to install WebSphere Application Server for the sample as a 32-bit or a 64-bit operating system. In typical mode, the WebSphere Application Server installation is silent and chooses the version that matches the operating system.\n\n\n \nFAQ: Why do I get MD5 checksum errors during the installation of Operational Decision Manager?\nAnswer: Errors can occur if you extract the installation TAR file by using the WinZip product. When WinZip extracts a TAR file, it converts UNIX and Linux formatted files into Windows format. As a result, the text files in the Operational Decision Manager TAR file are modified during the extraction and are found to have an incorrect MD5 checksum. \n\nTo resolve this issue, configure WinZip:\n\n1. Open WinZip.\n2. Click Options > Configuration, and click the Miscellaneous tab.\n3. Clear the TAR file smart CR/LF conversion check box. \n4. Extract the TAR file.\n\nFor more information about using WinZip, see the item about TAR file smart CR/LF conversion in the WinZip Knowledge Base at http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm [http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm].\n\nAlternatively, you can extract the installation TAR file by using a different product, such as 7-Zip.\n\n\n \nFAQ: Why does the launchpad hang when I click Typical Installation?\nAnswer: See the following technote: The Typical Installation option is extremely slow on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590801].\n\n\n \nFAQ: How do I install the product from the DVD?\nAnswer: See the following technote: Installing WebSphere Operational Decision Management V7.5 using DVDs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21571751].\n\n\n \nFAQ: What do I do if the install fails because Business Space isn't recognized?\nAnswer: See the following technote: WODM 7.5 installer can not recognize business space [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21580515] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21571751].\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nMigrating \n\nThe following problems and answers refer to migration. \n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I migrate from JRules to WebSphere Operational Decision Management?\nAnswer: See the following technote: Migrating from JRules to WODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725].\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nUsage \n\nThe following problems and answers refer to using this product. \n\n\n \nFAQ: Where can I find information about using Decision Server Rules?\nAnswer: See the online documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.rules/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_Decision_Server63.html].\n\n\n \nFAQ: Where is the Rule Studio for Java?\nAnswer: The Rule Studio for Java has been renamed Rule Designer. It is still based on Eclipse technology but now requires Eclipse V3.6. For more information, see What's new in Decision Server Rules [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.overview/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_DS_Overview66.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I get started using Decision Server Rules?\nAnswer: See Getting started with business rules [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.gettingstarted/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_DS_Getting_started85.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I check for null values in rules?\nAnswer: See Check for null values in rules [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585612].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I repackage the .rar archive of the execution unit (XU)?\nAnswer: In V7.x and V8.x, by using the res-setup Ant task, you can repackage the XU archive and update some of its properties. For more information, see the section \"Decision Server Rules > Reference > Rule Execution Server reference > Ant tasks > Ant tasks for Rule Execution Server setup > res-setup\" in the documentation.\n\n\n\nIf you need to repackage the XU with additional classes, such as to define a custom plug-in or ruleset cache implementation, you must repackage the archive manually. To do so, use a .zip compression tool. Do not use JAR tools because they might alter the metadata of the archive. RAR is a format for compressed archives, but RAR tools are not compatible because the XU .rar file is a JAR file, not a compressed RAR archive.\n\n\n\nFAQ: Why does the message \"The host appears to be running but port '-1' does not respond\" appear when testing a connection to Rule Execution Server from Decision Center?\nAnswer: See \"The host appears to be running but port \"-1\" does not respond. \" error when testing connection to Rule Execution Server from Decision Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21679679].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I configure Ant tasks to connect to Rule Execution Server over HTTPS?\nAnswer: See Configure ANT tasks to connect to Rule Execution Server and Decision Center over HTTPS [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21677726]. \n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I configure timestamps in z/OS log files for zRule Execution Server (zRES)?\nAnswer: See [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.gettingstarted/Content/Business_Rules/_pubskel/Infocenter_Primary/ps_DS_Getting_started85.html]How to configure timestamps in z/OS log files for zRule Execution Server (zRES) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21679665].\n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I use spaces as valid input values in a Decision Validation Services (DVS) Excel spreadsheet?\nAnswer: See Spaces as valid input values in a Decision Validation Services (DVS) Excel spreadsheet [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21677735].\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting \n\nThe following problems and answers refer to troubleshooting. \n\n\n\nFAQ: The installation failed with an WAS\\AppServer\\java\\docs\\autorun.inf (access is denied) error. How can I resolve this problem to install Decision Server Rules?\nAnswer: This error occurs if you try to install Decision Server Rules on a drive that is not C and you have an anti-virus software, such as Symantec Endpoint Protection, installed. To protect your system from attacks, some anti-virus security policies prevent tools from writing autorun.inf files on drives other than C. To complete the installation, install Decision Server Rules on C or disable this policy temporarily. For more information about disabling the policy, see your anti-virus software's documentation or speak with your IT department.\n\n\n \nFAQ: Where can I find support information about Decision Server Rules?\nAnswer: See WebSphere Operational Decision Management Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Operational_Decision_Management].\n\n\n FAQ: I have an installation of WebSphere Application Server 7.0, update 15 or later, that I want to reuse with Decision Server Rules; however, Installation Manager does not recognize the WebSphere Application Server installation and cannot install Business Space.\n\n\nI receive the following error: \n\n\nThe installation package 'IBM Business Space powered by WebSphere' requires components supplied by other packages. The required components might be supplied by the following installation packages: \nPackage: WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.15\n\n\nHow can I continue the installation? \nAnswer: Most likely, you did not use Installation Manager to install your instance of WebSphere Application Server and, therefore, Installation Manager is not aware of this installation. You must import the installation into Installation Manager. In the main menu of Installation Manager, click Import and follow the instructions in the wizard. For more information, see Import installed packages in Installation Manager [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/t_import_pkg.html].\n\n\n\nFAQ: Why can\u2019t I run a DVS test after I install the 7.5.0.1 fix pack?\nAnswer: In the 7.5.0.1 fix pack, one of the Decision Server library files has a new name. Any Decision Validation Services (DVS) launch configuration that was created in 7.5.0.0 cannot find the renamed file and the DVS test fails.\n\nTo correct this problem, do one of the following tasks:\n\n\n * Recreate the DVS Excel launch configuration.\n   \n   \n * Replace the JAR reference in the DVS Excel launch configuration by doing the following steps:  1. In Rule Designer, click Run > Run Configurations. \n       \n    2. Expand DVS Excel File and click your configuration. \n       \n    3. Click Classpath and click ILOG_EXECUTION_SERVER_HOME/lib/icu4j-4.2.1.jar. \n       \n    4. Click Remove.\n       \n    5. Click Advanced, click Add Classpath Variables, and click OK. \n       \n    6. Click ILOG_EXECUTION_SERVER_HOME and click Extend. \n       \n    7. Expand lib, click icu4j-4.2.1-patched.jar, and click OK. \n       \n    8. Click Apply.\n       \n   \n   \n\n\n\nFAQ: How do I improve rule execution and Rule Execution Server (RES) performance? \nAnswer: The document Improve performance of rule execution and Rule Execution Server (RES) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589513] addresses how to improve rule execution and RES performance.\n\n\n\nFAQ: When I run the diagnostics in the Rule Execution Server console, why does the test \"Rule Session Second Execution\" fail with a \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not all XUs have been updated with the new ruleset\" error?\nAnswer: See Rule Execution Server diagnostics failure [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584856].\n\n\n \nFAQ: How can I improve the performance of DVS and Decision Warehouse?\nAnswer: The document Improve Performance of Decision Validation Services (DVS) and Decision Warehouse [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21588859] addresses how to improve performance when you are conducting DVS tests and using Decision Warehouse.\n\n\n \nFAQ: How can I improve the performance of Rule Designer?\nAnswer: The document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21588859] Improve Performance of Rule Designer (WODM) and Rule Studio (JRules) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589514] addresses how to improve the performance of Rule Designer.\n\n\n \nFAQ: What can I do when an unexpected ruleset version is executed?\nAnswer: See An unexpected ruleset version is executed [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21598779].\n\n\n \nFAQ: After I install Decision Server, why can't I access Rule Execution Server console?\nAnswer: See Cannot access Decision Center or Rule Execution Server console (ODM) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678244].\n\n\n \nFAQ: Why can't I retrieve the HTDS description file for a ruleset on Rule Execution Server console?\nAnswer: See Cannot retrieve the HTDS Description File for a ruleset on Rule Execution Server console (ODM) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678842].\n\n\n \nFAQ: Why do I get an error starting Eclipse in headless mode?\nAnswer: See Error starting Eclipse in headless mode when working with ODM [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21677731].\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n FAQ - Business Space powered by WebSphere [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27020117]\nFAQ - IBM Business Monitor [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27017940]\nFAQ - IBM Business Process Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021829]\nFAQ - WebSphere Business Compass [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27017900]\nFAQ - WebSphere Integration Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg27016440]\nFAQ - WebSphere Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023698]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG Decision Validation Services [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023725]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023695]\nFAQ - WebSphere ILOG JRules [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023694]\nFAQ - WebSphere Decision Server Events [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023697]\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n IBM WebSphere Decision Server Rules",
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When running a Decision Validation Service scenario suite in Rule Team Server can the optional trace be filtered to reduce its size ? \n\nANSWER\nIt is possible to customize the Decision Warehouse (DW) trace that is used by the Scenario Suite Provider (SSP) when a Decision Validation Service (DVS) scenario suite is executed in Rule Team Server. The customization can filter out information that is not necessary to keep in the DW. A sample implementation is provided that removes information about all the rules that are not fired, which helps keep the size of the trace small when there is a large number of rules in the ruleset and typically a much smaller number of rules actually fire. Also, only the DW persisted trace is smaller, the original larger trace is still used by DVS to perform the tests involved in the scenario suite. \n\nInstructions: \n\n 1. Unjar the attached jrules-ssptrace-src.jar to a local directory \n 2. Edit the file ./jrules-ssptrace/build.xml and modify the properties to reflect your environment setup ( in particular the jrules.home directory path, the sspInput and sspOutput file paths ) \n 3.

    "question": "How to serve static images from our HTTP Server instead of WebSphere 8.5 application?",
    "gold_doc": [
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can I configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS), and the IBM web server Plug-in, and my web application running in WebSphere Application Server (WAS), to serve some of my static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from the IHS web server, but serve other static files from my web app running in WAS? \n\nCAUSE\nThe \"fileServingEnabled\" property in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the web application, is like an ON / OFF switch.\nA setting of fileServingEnabled=\"true\" means that ALL static files will be served from the web application in WAS only. In this case, the plug-in config will use a wildcard with the application context-root like \"/myapp/*\". That way every URL starting with /myapp/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand, fileServingEnabled=\"false\" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like \"/myapp/servlet1\" and \"/myapp/index.jsp\". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"/myapp/*\" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with \"myapp\" will be routed to the application in WAS. \n\n\nNow, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer/htdocs/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static/picture.jpg\", or \"static/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n/myapp/static/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any \"static\" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/static/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n</ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with /myapp/static/* then IHS will rewrite it to just /static/* and \"pass-through\". Since /static/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut, the file will really be served by IHS from here:\n/hostname/static/picture.jpg\n\nHere is another example:\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif, *.css and *.js files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif|css|js)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n\nWhich assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]/static/.\n\n4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg"

      " DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n This Fix Pack will upgrade your SPSS Statistics 24.0 installation to SPSS Statistics 24.0 FP2 (24.0.0.2) \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\nThis Fix Pack provides important product corrections for SPSS Statistics 24.0.\n\n\nIssues Corrected and Release Note(s): Fix List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049686]\n\nNOTE: The 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack contains all Interim Fixes made available for 24.0.0.0, as well as other corrected issues, and can be installed over any of the earlier Interim Fixes with no conflict.\n\nPREREQUISITES\nThis Fix Pack is language independent but can only be installed over existing client and server installations of IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.0\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n \nInstallation Windows \n\n 1. Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 3. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 4. Run the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack executable.\n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is now the installed version.\n\n\nGuidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Windows-based clients: NOTE: This Fix Pack may require the machine to be rebooted to complete the installation. Please be aware that \"pushing\" the installation in unattended, silent mode may therefore force an unexpected machine reboot on a user, and schedule such installations accordingly. \n\nThe SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Windows Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Extracting the Contents of a Downloaded Installer file\" and \"Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers\". \n\nIn this case: \n\n 1. Download the appropriate installer file to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Open a command window as the local Administrator account and change directory to the temporary download location. \n 3. Extract the \"SPSSStatistics24.0.0.2Patch.msi\" and locale-specific .mst file into a specified location from the downloaded FixPack installer file, \"24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe\",using the documented \"/b\" switch: 24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe /b\"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\" (where <OS> is your operating system) \n 4. You can then copy the two extracted files to a network share for easier distribution. \n 5. Install the patch: \n    \n    msiexec /i \"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\\SPSS_Statistics_24002_<OS>_Patch.msi\" /qn /L*V \"%temp%\\SPSSStatistics24002PatchLog.txt\" PYTHON_EXISTS=\"1\" TRANSFORMS=\"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\\1033.mst\"\n    \n    (where <OS> is the same operating system specification as in step 3)\n\n\nInstallation Mac \n\n 1. Download and save the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack to your local hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Execute the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack installer from the downloaded .dmg file. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the About Statistics 24 menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 release is supported on Apple Macintosh OS X 10.10.x (Yosemite) through macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) \n\nGuidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Macintosh-based clients: \n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 for Mac OS X has a silent (push) installer. To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: \n\n 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). \n 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. \n 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:\n    USER_INSTALL_DIR=/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24 \n 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. \n 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:\n    \n    ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties\n\n\nInstallation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the \u2018root\u2019 user. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nGuidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Linux-based clients: The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Linux Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Running a Silent Installation on Mac and Linux Computers\". \n\nNote: Please contact IBM SPSS Technical Support to obtain the appropriate installer.properties file for the Linux platform. \n\nSPSS Statistics Server - 24.0 FP2 Installation Instructions \n\nInstallation Windows \n\n 1. Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. \n 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. \n 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. \n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.\n\n\nInstallation UNIX/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX / Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation \n\n 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. \n 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. \n 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the /bin, /lib and /common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: \n    \n    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator\u2019s Guide for more information. \n 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): ./<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. \n 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): ./<installer_name>\n    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. \n 7. Start the Statistics Server after the Fix Pack installation is complete. \n 8. Run ./statisticsb and enter SHOW VERSION. The response should indicate 24.00.00.02\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

      " SECURITY BULLETIN\n\nSUMMARY\n A potential vulnerability exists within the JMSObjectMessage class, which IBM WebSphere MQ provides as part of its Java Message Service implementation. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nJMS Object messages depend on Java Serialization for marshalling/unmarshalling of the message payload. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to security flaws; a remote attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application that is using a JMS ObjectMessage. Applications that consume ObjectMessage type of messages can be vulnerable as they deserialize objects on ObjectMessage.getObject() calls. Applications which call toString() on a javax.jms.Message which has an underlying type of ObjectMessage can also be vulnerable, as this method performs deserialization. The MQ classes for JMS trace will call toString() on a javax.jms.Message object, and so are also vulnerable if the underlying type is an ObjectMessage. \n\n \n\nCVEID: CVE-2016-0360 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0360]\nDESCRIPTION: IBM Websphere MQ JMS client provides classes that deserialize objects from untrusted sources which could allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary Java code by adding vulnerable classes to the classpath. \nCVSS Base Score: 8.1\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111930 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111930] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nIBM MQ 9.0 \n\nIBM MQ 9.0.0.0 only \n\n \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 8.0 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.5 maintenance levels \n\n \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.5 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.5.0.0 through 7.5.0.7 maintenance levels \n\n \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.1 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.0.8 maintenance levels \n\n \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.0.1 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0 through 7.0.1.14 maintenance levels\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nIBM MQ 9.0 (Long Term Support) \n\nApply 9.0.0.1 maintenance level when available.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n \"Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Linux/Windows - Thanks for the memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/]\nAIX - Thanks for the Memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-aix/]\nIntroducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf]\nCompressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]\nIBM Java Compressed References and Native OOMs [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/kevgrig/entry/ibm_java_compressed_references_and_native_ooms]"

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n \"Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Linux/Windows - Thanks for the memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/]\nAIX - Thanks for the Memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-aix/]\nIntroducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf]\nCompressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]\nIBM Java Compressed References and Native OOMs [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/kevgrig/entry/ibm_java_compressed_references_and_native_ooms]"

      " PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n You can use the IBM Content Navigator administration tool to set all configuration options for the IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional Edition viewer, the IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer, the Document Streaming Server Module, and the Permanent Redaction Server Module. \n\nCONTENT\nAbout this task\n\n\nIBM Daeja ViewONE viewers\nThe IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional Edition viewer can be used with IBM FileNet P8 and IBM CMIS repositories. You must download an applet on the client to use this viewer.\n\nThe IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer can be used with any type of repository. You can use this viewer with zero footprint and no applet because it is based on DHTML5 technology using the browser. \n\nFor more information about the file types that are supported by each viewer, see Supported viewers [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco002.htm].\n\nSome features in the Professional Edition viewer are not available in the Virtual viewer. Some features in the Virtual viewer are not available in the Professional Edition viewer. For example, round-trip redaction is available in the Virtual viewer only, for IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3.5 or higher.\n\n\nIBM Daeja ViewONE modules\nThe Document Streaming Server Module allows you to stream the content of PDF files and TIFF files when you use the IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional Edition viewer. The Document Streaming Server module is not needed when you use the IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer because only the portions of the document that are viewed are downloaded. \n\nThe Permanent Redaction Server Module allows you to redact content in IBM FileNet P8 repository documents when you use the IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional Edition viewer. A separate license is required for redaction services. \n\nConfiguration parameters\nThe configuration parameters and valid parameter values for IBM Daeja ViewONE are documented in the IBM Daeja ViewONE Parameters Reference Manual [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTPHR_4.1.4/com.ibm.viewone.configuring/dvoco000.htm]. \n\nThe IBM Content Navigator administration tool provides options for parameters that are commonly used, and additional settings can be configured by entering the parameter name and value.\n\nThe following options are provided in the IBM Content Navigator administration tool:\n\n\n\nViewer or module Configuration options Professional  * Enable document streaming for PDF files and TIFF files if you want to make it faster for users to view these files. Disable the document streaming options if most of your files are small, or if you have a complex firewall or proxy server configuration. \n * Enable viewing unsupported image files by routing them to the browser, which opens the appropriate application for viewing the file. For example, to open a Microsoft Word document, the browser uses the Microsoft Word viewer. \n * Select whether to automatically fit the image in the viewer by best fit, fit by width, or fit by height. \n * Select the buttons and menus that you want to display on the viewer. \n * Enable file hot keys if you want users to use keyboard shortcuts to work with files, for example, to open or save a file. Enable print hot keys if you want users to use keyboard shortcuts for printing, for example, print page or print document. \n * Enter the text to display when no tooltip is specified for a custom annotation. The text can include replaceable tokens. For example, you can enter <creator> created this annotation on <createdateonly>. \n * Specify the parameters that enable the user to add image stamp annotations when viewing a document in a FileNet repository or CMIS repository. For more information, see Image Stamp Example. \n * Specify the URL for the help documentation to display when the user clicks the help icon in the viewer. You can provide a URL to your own custom help documentation or use the URL to the IBM Daeja ViewONE Product Documentation.\n\nVirtual  * Enter the text to display when no tooltip is specified for a custom annotation. The text can include replaceable tokens. For example, you can use <creator> created this annotation on <createdateonly>. \n * Specify the parameters that enable the user to add image stamp annotations when viewing a document. For more information, see Image Stamp Example. \n * Configure the default for saving redacted content by specifying one of the following options:  * Save the redacted content as a new document, and then specify whether to add the new document by using Add Document or by using an entry template. \n    * Allow users to choose from one of the following options to determine how redacted content is saved by default:  *  Save the redacted content in a new version of the existing document. Save the redacted content as a new document, and then specify whether to add the new document by using Add Document or by using an entry template. Download the redacted content and save it to your local system. \n      \n      \n   \n   \n\nDocument Streaming  * Specify the fully qualified path of the directory where you want to store cached files for faster access when you use document streaming. The directory can be on any operating system or device, such as a network directory, if it is visible as a file system to IBM Content Navigator and IBM HTTP Server. The cache directory cannot be shared with other document streaming instances. Use a local directory to improve performance. \n\n\n\nIf you want to specify more configuration options, use the Additional settings section to specify the parameter names and values. \n\nThe following examples show some parameter name and value combinations that you might want to set:  * For Professional, you can specify scrollbars and true if you want scroll bars to be displayed when the image is scaled to a size larger than the display area. \n * For Virtual, you can specify pageButtons and true if you want page buttons to be displayed on the toolbar. \n * For Document Streaming, you can specify cookieAllowedDomainList and a comma-separated list of host servers. \n * For Permanent Redaction, you can specify burnUseGZip and true if you want to compress the annotation data sent from IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional to the burn servlet. \n\nProcedure \nTo configure the Daeja ViewONE viewers and server modules:  1. Open the administration tool in the web client. \n 2. Click Settings > Daeja ViewONE. \n 3. Click the appropriate tab for the viewer or module that you want to configure.  1. Click the Professional tab to configure the settings for the IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional Edition viewer. \n     2. Click the Virtual tab to configure the settings for the IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer. \n     3. Click the Document Streaming tab to configure the settings for the Document Streaming Server Module if you enabled document streaming for PDF files or TIFF files. \n     4. Click the Permanent Redaction tab if the permanent redaction server module is installed. \n    \n    \n 4. Save your changes. \n 5. Restart the IBM Content Navigator server for the configuration changes to take effect. \n\n\n\nWhat to do next \nTo use the IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer, you must create a viewer map that includes the IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer and the associated file types. For more information about creating a viewer map, see Configuring viewers used to display documents in the web client [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco011.dita]. Then, select and edit your desktop, click the General tab, and for the Viewer map option, select the viewer map that you created. \n\nTo use the Document Streaming Server Module in a high availability cluster environment, you must create a cache directory in the install_dir /config directory on each node in the cluster. You must also copy the viewpro.streamer.properties file from the install_dir /config directory for IBM Content Navigator to the install_dir /config directory on each node in the cluster. \n\nTo use the Permanent Redaction Server Module in a high availability cluster environment, you must copy the viewpro.redacttofile.properties file from the install_dir /config directory for IBM Content Navigator to the install_dir /config directory on each node in the cluster. \n\nImage Stamp Example \nTo add an image stamp that uses the image file NewStamp.png, follow these steps:  1. Copy the image file NewStamp.png into the directory navigator_war/resources/images. \n 2. Open the administrator tool, click Settings >Daeja View ONE, and then click the Professional or Virtual tab. \n 3. For Image stamp resource context, enter the value: /navigator/${originalStampURL.query.path}. \n 4. For Additional settings, add the following parameter name and value pairs:\n    Parameter name: annotationStamp1\n    Value: image:NewStamp?path=resources/images/NewStamp.png\n    Parameter name: annotationStampProperties1\n    Value: <Menu=New> \n 5. Save your changes, and the New stamp is added to the menu of image stamps the next time you open the viewer.\n\n\nTo add more stamps, copy the image files into the directory navigator_war/resources/images, and set additional parameter name and value pairs by incrementing the index number N for annotationStampN and annotationStampPropertiesN. Image Stamp minimum required version: \n\n * For a CMIS repository: IBM Content Navigator, Version 2.0.3 Fix Pack 5 \n * For a FileNet Content Manager repository: IBM Content Navigator, Version 2.0.3 Fix Pack 5. \n * For an IBM Content Manager repository (Virtual only): IBM Content Navigator, Version 2.0.3 Fix Pack 7.

      "Daeja Viewer; display; size TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to change the default size of an image displayed in the Image Viewer for FileNet Business Process Framework \n\nANSWER\nThe default image display size is set in the WcmJavaViewer.jsp file in the \u201cUI-INF/jsp/ui\u201d folder of the deployed Workplace application.\nIn the WcmJavaViewer.jsp file, the following code sets the default display size:\nwriteParam('scale', 'ftow');\n\nThe \u201cftow\u201d scale setting enables the \"fit to window width\" icon on the toolbar of the Image Viewer as shown in the screen capture below.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590601&amp;aid=1]\n\nThe image display scale parameter is defined in the \u201cViewONE HTML and Installation Manual, Version 3.0\u201d document.\n\nFor attachment display, the display scale parameter has the following settings.\n\nParameter: Scale\n<PARAM NAME=\u201cscale\u201d value=\u201cbest\u201d> \u2026or\u2026\n<PARAM NAME=\u201cscale\u201d value=\u201cftow\u201d> \u2026or\u2026\n<PARAM NAME=\u201cscale\u201d value=\u201cftoh\u201d>\n\nThe scale parameter specifies the scaling algorithm to be used when displaying pages. Optional values are:\n\n\u201cbest\u201d:\nThe page is scaled to fit into the window area so that all of the page is visible.\n\n\u201cftow\u201d:\nThe page is scaled so that the width of the page matches the width of the window area.\nThis may result in the visible page height exceeding the available window height in which case a vertical scroll bar appears automatically.\n\n\u201cftoh\u201d:\nThe page is scaled so that the height of the page matches the height of the window area.\nThis may result in the visible page width exceeding the available window width in which\ncase a horizontal scroll bar appears automatically.\n\nModifying the parameter setting from \nwriteParam('scale', 'ftow');\nto\nwriteParam('scale', 'best');\nwill cause the default page display from \u201cftow\u201d (fit to window width) to \u201cbest\u201d (fit to window).\n\nThe Viewer can then display the entire image to fit the window, and the \"Fit to windows\" icon on the toolbar will be enabled as shown in the screen capture below.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590601&amp;aid=2]",

Expired certificates are removed at upgrade time.\n\nANSWER\nThe first step is to verify that the network is functioning correctly using these commands: \n\nshow int \n\nshow int mode \n\nshow route \n\n \n\nThose commands will show if there is any network activity as well as the ethernet link speed. \n\nOnce the network is confirmed, the quickest way to recover the web management and ssh services is to delete and recreate them with the default settings using the serial console. \n\nThe following commands will reset the RBM's, ACL's, WebGUI and SSH services to the default settings. \n\nNote: If the ssh is working, you may omit any commands with the ssh. \n\n \n\nconfig \n\nweb-mgmt \n\nno ssl \n\nexit \n\nwrite mem \n\ny \n\nno web-mgmt \n\nno ssh \n\nrbm \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nacl web-mgmt \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nacl ssh \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nwrite mem (key step to remove the current settings) \n\ny \n\nweb-mgmt <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is9090> \n\nssh <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is22> \n\nwrite mem \n\ny \n\n \n\nOnce complete, test the service and confirm you can now access the appliance. Then you may work to configure any custom certificates or authentication settings desired. \n\nIf this does not resolve the issue Contact DataPower Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower B2B Appliance XB60 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 5.0.0, 6.0.0 All Editions Business Integration WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 5.0.0, 6.0.0, 6.0.1 Edition Independent Business Integration WebSphere DataPower XML Security Gateway XS40 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 5.0.0, 6.0.0 All Editions"

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why are IBM WebSphere DataPower device types 4195 (XI50B) and 9235 showing the following warnings in the logs on pre-5.0.0.0 firmware:\n\n01:02:03 cert-monitor warn 383 0x806000e1 cert-monitor (Certificate Monitor): Certificate 'system-ssl-ca-cert' is expired\n01:02:03 cert-monitor warn 383 0x806000e1 cert-monitor (Certificate Monitor): Certificate 'system-cert' is expired\n\nOr in my browser I see this:\n\nThe certificate expired on 6/6/2013 4:13 PM.\n\nNote: Prior to June 6, 2013, the warnings indicate the certificate is about to expire. \n\nCAUSE\nBefore firmware release 5.0.0.0 the DataPower firmware on 4195 and 9235 platforms shipped with two certificates (system-ssl-ca-cert and system-cert) that expire on June 8, 2013 and June 6, 2013 respectively. \n\nBy default the DataPower WebGUI and XML Management Interface use these two certificates for SSL connectivity to those interfaces. Users can and should create and configure their own keys and certificates for SSL use on these interfaces.\n\n\nANSWER\nAfter June 6, 2013 some SSL clients may be unable to connect to the WebGUI and XML Management Interface if those interfaces are still using the default SSL configuration. The interfaces will not go down, but they will be presenting expired certificates which will cause strict SSL clients to fail the SSL handshake. \n\n\nNote: As long as the Objects>Crypto Configuration>Crypto Certificate Monitor option for Disabled Expired Certificates is turned OFF, the default setting, the certificate will continue to be used.\n\nThe Certificate Monitor may also warn about these two certificates as it gets near June 6, 2013. These warnings will only occur on firmwares that lack the fix for APAR IC91324. \n\nBy default these two certificates are involved in the SSL configurations of: \n\n * the web-mgmt services WebGUI \n * the XML Management Interface \n * other services which use these interfaces, including user created tooling using AMP, SOMA or WAMT\n\n\nThe certificate expirations may not cause problems, but if you do experience any issues then one of the two following approaches should solve the problem by using a new certificate. \n\n1) Configure your own SSL credentials in the WebGUI and XML Management Interface: \n- For the WebGUI certificate, see replacing the WebGUI certificate [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577098]. \n- For the XML Management Interface certificate, the instructions are similar but you go to the Control Panel -> Network -> Management -> XML Management Service and click on the Advanced tab. \n\n2) The 5.0.0.1 and later firmware versions include a certificate with a much later expiration date. It is recommended to upgrade to 5.0.0.8 or later firmware versions to obtain other critical APAR fixes on the 5.0.0 firmware. \n\nThis technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032998] discusses some details you may encounter when using the new certificate. \n\nIt is highly recommended and a Best Practice that you configure the WebGUI and XML Management Interface to use your own SSL credentials rather than relying on any default certificates. \n\nAdditional notes or considerations to be aware of: \n\nWSRR\nThe use of WSRR Subscription's \"automatic\" synchronization will eventually fail when the certificate for the XML Management Interface expires and WSRR will not be able to generate change notifications to DataPower. The corrective steps are to configure your own credentials for the XML Management interface as described earlier in this tech note, and then to re-configure the DataPower certificate material in the WSRR server with these new credentials. Please refer to the InfoCenter and these articles for how to configure the WSRR server:\nIBM developerWorks article with step-by-step detail under \"Configuring WSRR\" section [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1210_willoughby/1210_willoughby.html]: \n\nWSRR Information Center topic on adding DataPower certificates: [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.scenarios.soawdpwsrr.doc%2Ftopics%2Ftsoa2_wsrr_cert_truststore.htm]\n\n\nITCAM agent for DataPower \nConnectivity may fail due to expiration of the certificate when using the ITCAM agent for DataPower.\nPlease refer to the agent user guide for how to configure the \"custom SSL proxy profile [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1%2Fdatapower%2Ffac_config_agent_specific_unix.html]\" \n\nIf you have any problems or questions please contact IBM DataPower support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]. \n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower B2B Appliance XB60 Not Applicable 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Blade XI50B 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower XML Accelerator XA35 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower XML Security Gateway XS40 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 3.8.2, 4.0.1, 4.0.2",

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n I have installed GPU 600 and my GUI has stopped working. I have tried restarting it from CLI, how can I fix the issue? \n\nCAUSE\nOn some appliances, the certificates required to enable the GUI are created in a scrambled format due an issue with the keytool that is used to create them. It is not possible to predict when this issue will arise. This means that, when GPU 600 is installed, this certificate is not able to be restored due to its corrupted format. \nIn order to detect whether your appliance is prone to the issue:\nYou should find themysql error logcontained in must_gather system_db_info . This log is named differently depending on whether the system is 32 bit or 64 bit.\n- 32 bit error log is named [hostname].err\n- 64 bit error log is named mysql-error.log\nIn this log there are many messages with corresponding timestamps.\nIf you see the following messages, you can be prone to this issue:\nSSL error: Unable to get certificate from '/usr/local/guardium/etc/server-cert.pem'\n2016-01-27 14:23:10 6757 [Warning] Failed to setup SSL\n2016-01-27 14:23:10 6757 [Warning] SSL error: Unable to get certificate\n\n\nANSWER\nThere are two possible solutions to fix this issue: \n\n1) Contact Guardium Support for the relevant patches required to ensure the issue does not happen again. They will provide you with two patches, along with instructions on their installation and usage. \n\nOne will be installed before you install GPU 600, to create a valid backup of the keystore that is used for storing the certificates. \n\nThe other will be installed after you install GPU 600, in order to restore this backup and provide logs for any issues encountered. \n\n2) Run a CSR task before the patch installation:\nHow to install an appliance certificate to avoid a browser SSL certificate challenge [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMPHH_9.1.0/com.ibm.guardium91.doc/how_to/topics/how_to_install_an_appliance_certificate_to_avoid_browser_ssi_certificate_challenge.html]\nThis creates a keystore backup automatically. \nThen, after p600 installation, run the CLI command: \nrestore certificate keystore backup \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n How to install an appliance certificate to avoid a brow [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMPHH_9.1.0/com.ibm.guardium91.doc/how_to/topics/how_to_install_an_appliance_certificate_to_avoid_browser_ssi_certificate_challenge.html]",
      "DataPower; pubcert; expire; certificate; crypto ; expiring; certificates TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What are some guidelines with respect to managing expired third-party public CA certificates in the pubcert: directory on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance? \n\nANSWER\nWhile the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance provides some standard public CA certificates in pubcert: for convenience, you may encounter missing certificate file errors after firmware upgrades across major release boundaries.\n\nWhat would cause a certificate file to be removed from pubcert:?\nAt the beginning of any major firmware release (3.7.1.0 or 3.7.2.0 or 3.7.3.0 or 3.8.0.0), all expired public CA certificates are removed from the pubcert: directory in the firmware packaging. Expired public CA certificates are not removed in minor firmware releases. This means that upgrading within a release series will not cause a certificate file to be removed from pubcert: but upgrading across a major release boundary might.\n\nWill a firmware upgrade fix the missing certificate file error?\nA firmware upgrade will not fix the missing certificate file error since firmware upgrades do not include replacement public certificates to update expired certificates. Replacement certificates for expired public certificates must be obtained from the vendor's public site and uploaded to the DataPower appliance. \n\nHow can I fix my configuration when a certificate file is removed from pubcert:?\nIf the CA in question is not needed by the customer, then the configuration can be repaired by removing references to the removed certificate file. This can be accomplished by first finding any Crypto Certificate objects that refer to the removed file (they will be in a down state), then by removing references to that Crypto Certificate from any configuration objects that refer to it (such as Validation Credentials objects), and finally by deleting the Crypto Certificate object in question.\n\nIf the CA in question is needed by the customer, then the user must obtain an updated copy from the CA's public site, upload the new certificate to the DataPower appliance, and then reconfigure the down Crypto Certificate object to refer to the new certificate file.\n\nHow can I monitor for certificate expiration?\nCustomers have the option of defining a Certificate Monitor, a configurable periodic task used to check and report on expiration dates of Crypto Certificate objects. Refer to the Administrator's Guide for details on configuring the monitor. Note that the Certificate Monitor only checks certificates for which a Crypto Object is configured in that it scans the list of configured objects rather than scanning all files in a given directory. Refer to the WebSphere DataPower product documentation portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21377654] to access the Administrator's Guide. You will need to sign into the portal with your IBM registration ID.\n\nFor example, the terminology as logged by the error log might contain errors like these\n\n1,20140225T064505Z,default,audit,error,,,95,,0x8240001b,,,\"(SYSTEM:default:*:*): certificate 'ABC-Global-CA-pem' - File is unreadable\"\n\n1,20140225T064506Z,default,crypto,error,certificate,GTE-CyberTrust-Root-4-pem,95,,0x80600086,,,\"*certificate file 'pubcert:ABC-CyberTrust-Root-4.pem' unreadable*\"\n\nThe files are listed as unreadable. If a user goes into the file system and views one of these certificates, they will see the validity date has passed.",

This FixPack adds support for Oracle 12 for both profile and system tables. To use Oracle system tables, you must perform a fresh installation of IBM Opportunity Detect 9.1.1 or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1, and then install this FixPack. Data migration from DB2 is not supported. \n\n2. New queue data source connectors for real time processing. To support the addition of queue connectors, the following new fields were added on the Properties tab of deployment configurations: Input mode, Input version, and Output version. \n\n3. Labels are now required in the Additional Information field of the Action component.\n\n4. This FixPack upgrades IBM InfoSphere Streams to version 3.2.1.2.\n\nThis FixPack supports Active MQ version 5.11 or IBM WebSphere Message Queue version 8 for use with queue data source connectors.\n\nDescriptions of these features have been added to the following documents.\nIBM Opportunity Detect 9.1.1 Administrator's Guide\nIBM Opportunity Detect 9.1.1 User's Guide\n\n9.1.1.1\nThe primary purpose of this fix pack is to incorporate the LLM (Low Latency Messaging) protocol for TCP communication. This protocol increases performance by reducing the time needed both to send real-time I/O messages and to send messages between the various internal components.\n\n(DEF 178228)\nIf a Weighted Counter Pattern had negative Patterns as incoming events, the action was fired twice. This issue has been fixed.\n\n(DEF 178226)\nIf a Counter Pattern had negative patterns as incoming events, the action was fired twice. This issue has been fixed.\n\n(DEF 178313)\nIf you applied functions in a Select where clause, the cursor position was lost and the page was refreshed. This issue has been fixed.\n\n(DEF 180220)\nMatch All Patterns did not fire if a Forward Inactivity component was used as an incoming event. This issue has been fixed.\n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nAll IBM EMM products must be at the same FixPack level.\n\nOpportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns:\nIBM Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns must be at version 9.1.1, or any 9.1.1 FixPack prior to 9.1.1.4.\n\nIf you use Oracle for your system tables, your version must be 9.1.1.2 or later.\n\nOther IBM EMM products:\nIBM Marketing Platform and other products must be at version 9.1.1.4.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\nNote: See the IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1 Installation Guide for additional information.\n\nTask 1 - Before you begin\n\n1. If you want to use Oracle for your Opportunity Detect system tables, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:\n- Install IBM Marketing Platform 9.1.1 with Oracle as the system tables.\n- Install IBM Opportunity Detect 9.1.1 or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1,\nselecting Oracle as the database and using the Manual database set up option.\nAt this point, you can skip the Streams installation and install the upgraded version of Streams when you install this Fix pack.\n- Upgrade Marketing Platform to FixPack 9.1.1.4. \n\n2. Make a back up copy of the following: \n- The OpDetection folder on the Opportunity Detect Design Time server \n- The/home/streamsadmin/OpDetection folder on the Opportunity Detect Run Time server\n- The database schemas used for Opportunity Detect Design Time and Run Time \n\n3. Ask all users to log out of IBM Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns and stop all running services, including StreamsRCS, Interact Design Service, Real Time Connector, and the Streams instance.\n\n4. Stop all Streams instances.\nstreamtool stopinstance -i Your_Instance_Name\n\n5. If you are upgrading from 9.1.1 or 9.1.1.1 do the following.\na.Remove all Streams instances. For example:\nstreamtool rminstance -i Your_Instance_Name\nb. Install the required Streams RPMs for RHEL6.\nSee the topic \"Required RPMs for RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 on x86_64 systems\" in the IBM InfoSphere Streams Version 3.2.1 Installation and Configuration Guide.\nc. Run the Streams dependency checker script. \nSee the topic \"Dependency checker script for InfoSphere Streams\" in the IBM InfoSphere Streams Version 3.2.1 Installation and Configuration Guide. \n\nTask 2 - Install the IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1.4 Fix Pack\n\n1. Run the IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1.4 FixPack installer through the IBM EMM Installer on all servers where IBM Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns is installed (Design Time and Run Time components).\n\nNOTE: If you have a distributed Run Time environment, see the Installation Guide, Chapter 8: Configuring Opportunity Detect in a cluster, for additional steps.\n\nFor installations that use DB2 for system tables, use the same options as used during base installation, as described in the Installation Guide.\n\nFor installations that use the newly supported Oracle system tables, select Automatic database setup in the FixPack installer.\n\nNOTE: As this is a FixPack installer, it is expected that the 9.1.1 release has already been installed on the current machine using the same user account that is running the FixPack installer. If the FixPack installer cannot find a previously installed release, contact IBM Technical Support for assistance. \n\n2. If you are using DB2 for your system tables and you selected Manual database setup, execute SQL scripts on the Design Time database schema after installation is complete, as follows.\n\nIf you have version 9.1.1 with no fixPacks applied, or if you have applied IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns FixPack 9.1.1.1, run the following scripts:\nMigration911_FP1.sql\nMigration911_FP2.sql\nMigration911_FP3.sql\nMigration911_FP4.sql\n\nIf you have applied IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns FixPack 9.1.1.2, run the following scripts:\nMigration911_FP2.sql\nMigration911_FP3.sql\nMigration911_FP4.sql\n\nThese files are located under your Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns installation in the following path: \n<installation_directory>/database/<database_type>/Upgrade \nThe default installation directory is OpDetection.\n\n\nTask 3 - Perform manual steps required by the Streams upgrade\n\nThis FixPack upgrades Streams to version 3.2.1.2. Perform these steps only if you are upgrading from 9.1.1 OR 9.1.1.1, which uses the previous version of Streams. If your version is 9.1.1.2 o or above, you do not need to perform these steps.\n\n1. Execute the Firststeps script as described in the Streams documentation, in the topic \"Performing post-installation tasks using the InfoSphere Streams First Steps application\" in the IBM InfoSphere Streams Version 3.2.1 Installation and Configuration Guide.\n\n2. Recreate the Streams instances in your environment. You should give your new instances the same names as used in your old version. If the instances are given new names, you must to point your server groups to the new Streams instances.\n\n3. Update the JAVA_HOME entry in the .bashrc file of streamsadmin user.\nChange this:\nJAVA_HOME=/opt/ibm/java-x86_64-60\nto this:\nJAVA_HOME=/home/streamsadmin/InfoSphereStreams/java\n\n4. Set up ulimit parameters.\nSee the topic \"Guidelines for configuring Linux ulimit settings for InfoSphere Streams\" in the IBM InfoSphere Streams Version 3.2.1 \nInstallation and Configuration Guide.\n\n5. Perform the following steps to synchronize the new Streams servers in Opportunity Detect or Interact Advanced Patterns.\n\na. Log in to Opportunity Detect or Interact Advanced Patterns. \nb. Navigate to Detect Settings > Server Groups. \nc. Click \"Synchronize with changed streams configuration\". \nIf you did not change the names of your Streams instances in step 2, this action brings the new Streams instances into your server groups.\nd. If you changed the names of any Streams instances in step 2, point your \nserver groups to the new Streams instances.\n\nTask 4 - Perform manual steps for Oracle\n\nIf you are using Oracle as your system table database, configure the Streams database adapters for Oracle. Use unixODBC with the Oracle driver to link Streams to the database.\n\nPerform the following procedure. See the IBM InfoSphere Streams documentation for additional details. \n\n1. Only if you plan to use Oracle, configure the following environment \nvariables for compiling Streams adapters with Oracle.\nSTREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_ORACLE - Sample value: true\nSTREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_INCPATH - Sample value: /mydir/unixodbc/include\nSTREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_LIBPATH - Sample value: /mydir/unixodbc/lib\n\n2. Configure the following environment variables for the runtime processes.\nODBCINI - Sample value: /mydir/odbc.ini\nORACLE_HOME - Sample value: \n/home/oracle/oracle/112client/oracle/product/12.1.0\n/client_1\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH - Sample value: \nIf you are using static linking:\n/home/oracle/oracle/112client/oracle/product/12.1.0/\nclient_1/lib\nIf you are not using static linking:\n/home/oracle/oracle/112client/oracle/product/12.1.0/\nclient_1/lib:/mydir/unixodbc/lib\n\n3. Create or modify an odbc.ini file located in the path specified in the ODBCINI environment variable. \nExample, where the data source name is \"twins\":\n[twins]\nDriver = /home/oracle/oracle/112client/oracle/product/12.1.0/client_1/\nlib/libsqora.so.11.1\ndescription = test\nServerName = 10.1.1.92:1521/twins.example.com\nserver = 10.1.1.92\nport = 1521\nLongs = F\n\nNOTE: The data source name used in the connection.xml document must match the data source name in the odbc.ini file. \n\nTask 5 - Perform manual steps for Interact Advanced Patterns or Opportunity Detect with the Web Service \n\n1. If you are using Interact Advanced Patterns, and you have deployed an interactive channel, run the following update statements against your system table database. These statements set the appropriate value in the new Input mode field.\n\nupdate DeploymentConfiguration set inputMode = 3;\nupdate DeploymentHistory set inputMode = 3;\n\nThese statements set the input mode to TCP.\n\n2. If you are using Opportunity Detect and use the Web Service connector in a Workspace, run the following update statements against your system table database.\n\nupdate DeploymentConfiguration set inputMode = 2;\nupdate DeploymentHistory set inputMode = 2;\n\nThese statements set the input mode to Web. \n\n\nTask 6 - Perform post-installation configuration if necessary\n\nIf you have installed the DB2 client in a location that is different from the default location, you must update the function.xml file as follows.\n\nThe function.xml file is located in the /home/streamsadmin/OpDetection/toolkits/unica_db_access/db.access/native.function \ndirectory.\n\na. Locate the following section in the file.\n<library>\n<cmn:description sampleUri=\"\"></cmn:description>\n<cmn:managedLibrary>\n<cmn:lib>UnicaDatabaseAccessLib</cmn:lib>\n<cmn:lib>db2</cmn:lib>\n<cmn:libPath>../../impl/lib</cmn:libPath>\n<cmn:libPath>/data/dbclient/DB2/lib64</cmn:libPath>\n<cmn:includePath>../../impl/include</cmn:includePath>\n<cmn:includePath>/data/dbclient/DB2/include</cmn:includePath>\n</cmn:managedLibrary>\n</library>\n\nb. Correct the path in the following lines to reflect the location of your DB2 client.\n<cmn:libPath>/data/dbclient/DB2/lib64</cmn:libPath>\nand\n<cmn:includePath>/data/dbclient/DB2/include</cmn:includePath>\n\n\nTask 7 - Restart the IBM Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns components\n\n1. Undeploy the Detect WAR file in the application server.\n\n2. Stop the web application server (WebSphere).\n\n3. Clear temp data from the web server directory. \nSee Appendix A: Clean application server cache.\n\n4. Restart the web application server.\n\n5. Deploy the Opportunity Detect WAR file.\n\n6. If a JAVA_HOME environment variable is defined on the Streams server where Run Time is installed, ensure that it is set to point to Java 6.\n\n7. Ensure that the Path variable on the Streams server where Run Time is installed points to Java 6. \n\n8. Restart the web application server to start the IBM Marketing Platform and IBM Opportunity Detect or IBM Interact Advanced Patterns web applications. \n\n8. Start your Streams instance, Streams RCS, Real Time Connector, and Interact web service as described in the IBM Opportunity Detect and IBM Interact Advanced Patterns 9.1.1 Installation Guide.\n\n\nTask 8 - Redeploy Interactive Channels or workspaces\n\n1. If you are using Interact Advanced Patterns, redeploy your Interactive Channels in IBM Interact.\n\n2. Redeploy all Opportunity Detect workspaces. .\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\nFix pack Installers\n\nIBM Opportunity Detect:\nIBM_OpportunityDetectAndInteractAdvancedPatterns_9.1.1.4_linuxrhel64.bin\n\nIBM EMM Installer:\nIBM_Installer_9.1.1.4.sh \nIBM_Installer_9.1.1.4_linux.bin",

      " RELEASE NOTES\n\nABSTRACT\n IBM\u00ae StoredIQ\u00ae for Legal 2.0.3.2 is available. Read this document to find information about installation, product updates, compatibility issues, limitations, and known problems. \n\nCONTENT\nStoredIQ for Legal enables you to automate your legal hold notification and compliance process, and to optimize your preservation and collection process.\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\nThe StoredIQ for Legal announcement is available at \n\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/6/897/ENUS217-406/index.html [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/6/897/ENUS217-406/index.html]\n\n\nSee the announcement for the following information: \n\n * Detailed product description \n * Product-positioning statement \n * Packaging and ordering details\n\n\nFor more information about V2.0.3.2, see What's new in StoredIQ for Legal V2.0.3 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.welcome.doc/whatsnew.htm], What's changed in StoredIQ for Legal V2.0.3 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.welcome.doc/whatschanged.htm], and Download IBM StoredIQ for Legal V2.0.3.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043874]. \n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nBefore you deploy IBM\u00ae StoredIQ for Legal, verify that you meet these prerequisites: \n\n * At least one physical server with sufficient processor, RAM, and hard disk configuration for the planned management project. \n * VMWare ESX or VMWare ESXi on CD/DVD or USB drive. \n * IP addresses, cables, and physical switch ports for the VMWare ESX or VMWare ESXi interface. \n * A virtual machine (VM) with at least 4 vCPUs, a memory of 14 GB, and a storage of 250 GB. \n * A network connection. The ports 9443, 9043, 443, and 22 are needed for a connection between the administrative workstation and the VM. The connection to directory server, email server, and IBM StoredIQ server will be configured in StoredIQ for Legal. You can use the ports that fit your environment requirements. \n\n\nFor detailed information about hardware and software compatibility, see the detailed system requirements document [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.plan.doc/p_sysreq.htm]. \n\nINSTALLING STOREDIQ FOR LEGAL\nIf you download the product from IBM Passport Advantage\u00ae, follow the directions in the download document at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043874 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043874].\n\nFor installation instructions, see the topics in the section about deploying and configuring [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.deploy.doc/d_deploy.htm]in the StoredIQ for Legal documentation.\n\nFor upgrade instructions and additional migration information, check the section about upgrading [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.deploy.doc/d_upgrade.htm]. \n\nISSUES, LIMITATIONS, AND WORKAROUNDS\nISSUES\nAt the time of publication, the following issues were known:\n\nAlthough the final upgrade status shows completed, one or more individual configuration steps might have failed\nAlthough the last entry in the upgrade log file shows upgrade completed, check the complete log file for errors, especially the sections for the SSL and SSO configuration steps. To avoid the most common configuration errors, make sure the following information is available prior to upgrading the system:\n\n\n * The value of the certificateAliasFromKeyFile configuration setting in the /home/was/certs/upload/input.cfg file must match the alias of the certificate referenced in the metadata file. \n * The /siq/conf/saml2-idp-metadata.xml file must exist.\n\n\nThe upgrade log files might show SQL errors although the upgrade was completed successfully \nDuring the upgrade (specifically during schema initialization), the SQL errors SqlSyntaxErrorExceptionand SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException might be written to the log files. These error messages can be ignored. \n\nThe global hold reminder overview lists released custodians until the next reminder cycle starts \nA custodian who is released from all hold notices that participate in the current global hold reminder \ncycle will still show up on the Global Hold Reminder Overview page with the status the custodian \nhad before being released from the last hold notice. However, no further follow-up messages to the global \nhold reminder will be sent to the released custodian. As soon as the next reminder cycle starts, the list of custodians is updated to reflect only those custodians who have active hold notices participating in the global hold reminder. \n\nLIMITATIONS\nAt the time of publication, the following limitations were known:\n\nASCII based sorting in upgraded clients\nAlthough the new StoredIQ for Legal 2.0.3.2 client uses case-insensitive lexical sorting, clients migrated from 2.0.3 which were themselves migrated from 2.0.2.1 or earlier, will continue to use case-sensitive sorting based on the numeric character value.\n\nExisting backup files can no longer be used after upgrade\nBecause of changes to the internal keystore settings, backup files created with earlier product versions cannot be used to restore data in StoredIQ for Legal 2.0.3.2. Therefore, create a new backup file as soon as you completed the upgrade.\n\nMessage editor limitations \n\n * When underlining text and modifying the text color, sometimes the color is not applied to the underline. \n * No user-specific formatting style is applied to the system variables. \n * In Mozilla Firefox, system variables cannot be selected via keyboard operations. \n * In Microsoft Edge, when you paste within the contents section of an interview, a hold notice, or the respective templates, the cursor jumps to the end of the page and back to the pasted text. \n\nWORKAROUNDS\nThe following workarounds to known issues are available:\n\nImported workflow and report definitions, import mappings, and data request forms might not work\nIf you import workflow and report definitions, import mappings, and data request forms that were created on a system with a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3.1 into a system with a later StoredIQ for Legal version, these definitions and forms might not work. \n\nStarting with Version 2.0.3.1, the names of newly created custom attributes internally are prefixed with \"ca_\". When defining custom attributes in a system with a later StoredIQ for Legal version with display names that you used for attributes referenced in definitions and forms in a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3.1 and reuse these definitions and forms in later versions, the names will not match. To fix this issue, edit the respective .json, .csv, .bpmn, or .rtpdesign file and update the attribute names to match the new naming scheme.\n\nThe Db2 configuration settings might not be updated during the upgrade\nWhen upgrading from a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3, the Db2\u00ae configuration parameters might not be updated to the new settings. Some transactions might fail due to the limited transaction log size. As a workaround, change the settings manually by running the following commands:\n\nrunuser -l db2inst -c \"/home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using logfilsiz 4096\"\nrunuser -l db2inst -c \"home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using logsecond 100\"\nrunuser -l db2inst -c \"/home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using locktimeout 40\"\n\nRestart the StoredIQ for Legal server after changing the settings.\n\nThe upgrade to StoredIQ for Legal Version 2.0.3.2 might fail because of a docker container start error\nDuring the upgrade, an error like the following might occur:\n\n2017-03-10 09:12:10 Container ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst not running -> starting... \nContainer ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst not running -> starting... \nError response from daemon: open /dev/mapper/docker-253:1-134317184-14cf1dfbc32c1f986fc931782bc06ba747fd4d8baa8d9b9c3b5c9cf0f23f6c73: no such file or directory\nError: failed to start containers: ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst\n\nIn this case, the upgrade fails.\nAs a workaround, restart the upgrade process.\n\nWhen a custodian is added to a recurring interview, the status shown on the overview page might be misleading\nWhen a custodian is added to a recurring interview, the status of the custodian is immediately shown as Response pending - Initial even if the initial interview hasn't been sent yet. \n\nTo determine whether the initial interview has been sent already, check the Initial interview column in the custodians list. If this column is empty, the initial interview hasn't been sent yet. If the Initial interview column contains a date, the initial interview has been sent already.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\nYou can find the most current version of the product documentation at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.welcome.doc/storediq_legal.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.welcome.doc/storediq_legal.htm].",
      "ssl-max-entries; cache; sessions TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n After upgrading our IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business or migrating to IBM security Access Manager we have noticed a potential performance issue on some of our applications. After investigation it seems there are more SSL/TLS negotiations being completed than normal. Has something changed that may be causing these additional negotiations? \n\nANSWER\nA change was made in the way that WebSEAL (TAM 6.1.1 FP12 and onwards) and the Web Reverse Proxy (ISAM 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and onwards) stores SSL/TLS session IDs per user session.\n\nTraditionally there was only a single SSL/TLS session ID kept for each user within WebSEAL. With this additional change multiple SSL/TLS session IDs are now stored and thus the session cache has the potential to become full more quickly.\n\nA consequence of this change, is that additional tuning of the WebSEAL ssl-max-entries configuration parameter may be required on the TAMeb, post fix pack 12, and ISAM environments. This additional tuning is particularly relevant when the junctioned applications uses applets, servlets or makes AJAX style calls..\n\nAs there are many variables that may affect this tuning there is no specific algorithm that can be provided to match all deployments, there is no one size fits all recommendation for the ssl-max-entries. The setting of this configuration option should be considered as an iterative approach increasing the value and revalidating that the increased load can now handle the inbound user load. \n\nInitial recommendation for tuning the ssl-max-entries configuration: \n\nAfter upgrading or adding an additional application to the deployment, if a performance issue (which can include transaction performance as well is CPU utilization) is encountered and the ssl-max-entries configuration is still set to its default value of 4096 (or even if it has been previously increased, including up to something like 40960) , start by increasing the value higher (for example, set \"ssl-max-entries = 409600\"). Test and check for performance during heavier usage of the environment and verify that you have seen an increase in throughput and a decrease in SSL/TLS renegotiations. If, over time, additional performance issues are encountered again, increase the ssl-max-entries configuration and adjust to match the current inbound load. The expected result from this iterative process should be increased throughput and faster response times. \n\n\nNot tuning / addressing this setting properly can lead to thrashing of SSL Session IDs, which can in turn result in:\n\n- Higher CPU utilization\n- SSL Handshake delays appearing (manifesting) as slower response times\n- Timeouts of SSL Handshakes\n** Rejecting connection\n** Loadbalancers may mark a webseal offline, making the problem even worse, as all traffic would\nthen be routed to a subset of available webseals.",
      " FLASH (ALERT)\n\nABSTRACT\n In Streams 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2 Streams jobs may not pick up the user enviroment from the streams user's .bashrc. This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code\n   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver\n   Manager]Connnection does not exist.\"\n * \n\nProblem Solution \n\nTo work around the issue, set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance with:  * \n   \n * streamtool setproperty\n * -d <domain> -i <instance>\n   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n * \n   \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IT18432 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT18432]"

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What backup should be done before applying a Fix Pack or interim fix over Cognos Planning ?\nWhat is the step-by-step procedure to update Planning ? \n\nANSWER\n- Download the required Planning 10.1.1 fix from IBM Fix Central:\nhttps://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Cognos&product=ibm/Information+Management/Cognos+8+Planning&release=All&platform=Windows+32-bit,+x86&function=all [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Cognos&product=ibm/Information+Management/Cognos+8+Planning&release=All&platform=Windows+32-bit,+x86&function=all]\nNote that a Fix Pack (FP) can be installed over any previous versions of the same major realease, whereas an Interim Fix (IF) must be installed over a specific Fix Pack.\nFor example : \n10.1.1 FP7 can be installed over 10.1.1 FP3 or 10.1.1 FP5 IF1 or anything else\n10.1.1 FP7 IF2 can be installed over 10.1.1 FP7 only \n\n- Before applying the Fix Pack or interim fix, it is recommended to perform an \"Export Model and Data\" from the \"Tools / Deployment\" menu of the CAC (Contributor Administration Console). Export everything including Analyst libraries if they are not too big, otherwise Analyst libraries may be already backed up in other ways by the admin team ; since libraries usually are on the network share, there is probably already some batch to take care of that. Check this with your IT service. \n\n- It is also recommended to save the current configuration for each installed component : open IBM Cognos Configuration on each Planning machine, go to \"File / Export As\" and save the decrypted configuration as \"cogstartup_decrypt.xml\". This can be useful in case of any configuration problem. \n\n- Stop all client and admin tools and Cognos services (\"IBM Cognos\" and \"IBM Cognos 10 Planning\"). Open Task Manager and verify there is nothing left running from the /ibm folder, in particular verify there is no cognosrcp.exe running (otherwise, just kill it using Windows Task Manager) \n\n- Ask the DBA to back up the current Planning Store database and all the Planning Contributor application databases. \n\n- One additional possible backup can be to simply make a copy of the whole /ibm directory : doing that, it would be even simpler to get back to the previous situation in case of any problem : you would jst have to rename the backup back to /ibm again. \n\n- Now you can apply the fix pack or interim fix : just run the \\win32\\issetup.exe from the installation kit and follow the instructions. If for some reason you think you may not have all necessary rights on the system (because of internal policies or Windows UAC for example) then run issetup.exe by righ-click \"Run as Administrator\" \n\n- The fix has to be run for every server machines of the architecture, and for every components installed on a given server machine. For example, if one single machine has two distinct installations (for example one for the gateway and one for the Planning Server), then the fix has to be applied two times. This is the case when the Planning gateway has been installed over an existing Cognos BI Gateway 10.2.x 32-bit (in case of mixed environment Planning 10.1.1 + Cognos BI 10.2.x) \n\n- Once applied, open IBM Cognos Configuration and Save the configuration, then restart services. \n\n- Once the servers upgraded, the FP or IF installation kit can be applied on other admin client machines where Planning Administration may be installed. \n\n- Contributor Web clients will be automatically updated when users reconnect to the Planning server.",
      "Fixpack Fix Pack MDM TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I discover which Fix Pack I have installed for version MDM 11.x? \n\nANSWER\nIf you do not know which Fix Packs you have installed, please go to your WebSphere Console -> Applications -> Application Types -> Assets -> com.ibm.mdm.hub.server.app-*.eba -> Update bundle versions in this application. \nYou will need to check the Deployed Version for all of the bundles. When you are looking at the versions, they will be in this format:\n\n11.x.0.FPyyyIFzzz_<builddate>\n\nThe 11.x refers to the major version of MDM in use, for example 11.4.\n\nThe FPyyy indicates the Fix Pack for that bundle. You are looking for the highest number for the Fix Pack for all of your bundles. For example you may see a lot of your bundles have FP000 but find some that are also FP002. This would mean you have Fix Pack 2.\n\nNot every bundle is updated when a Fix Pack is released, which explains the potential mixture of bundle FP versions.\n\nThe IFzzz indicates the iFix (interim fix) version. iFixes are \"standalone\" fixes distributed outside of the schedule of a full Fix Pack, typically when critical issues are discovered that require an accelerated fix release.",
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Is IBM ECM Widgets 4.5.2 supported under WebSphere version 8.0? Are there any \nplan to support WebSphere 8.0? \n\nANSWER\nThe answers are no to both questions. The reason being is that Business Space code (7.0.x) was not developed/tested on WAS 8. There is no plan to test and qualify Business Space code(7.0.x) on WAS 8 or later. That means ECM Widget is not supported under WAS 8.0 as well.",

      " RELEASE NOTES\n\nABSTRACT\n On an AIX platform without a Common Desktop Environment (CDE), if you use VNC to connect to the X desktop to launch the Composite Platform Installation Tool (CPIT) in interactive or silent mode, you might experience a time-out error. \n\nCONTENT\nThe Installation Complete window in CPIT displays this message: Errors occurred during the installation. See the installation log for more information. \n\nThe IBM/cpit/cpit_install_log_5.0.0.txt log displays a message similar to:\n\n***IllegalThreadStateException - Timeout Error in monitorProcess: (12/23) installCE.sh. java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException: process hasn't exited\nERROR in InvokeScripts-function - Terminate the remaining scripts.\n***Aborting InvokeScripts-Install function.\n\nCauses\n\nDuring the automatic installation and configuration of FileNet P8 Platform on AIX, the IBM Tivoli\u00ae Directory Server Instance Administration Tool launches a grid-like window. You must click this window to access the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool interface. In the interface, you must close this window by using the Close button and confirming the exit when prompted. If you do not close this window during the installation, the process times out and the FileNet P8 Platform installation is unsuccessful.\n\nResolving the problem\n\nYou can prevent the time-out issue by changing to one of the following approaches:\n\n\n *  Install Common Desktop Environment (CDE) before you run the installation \n *  Use a utility other than VNC to connect to the AIX server \n *  Use telnet to run the installation in silent mode\n\n\nTo recover from an unsuccessful installation caused by a time-out issue: \n\nIf you created a backup of the server where you planned to run the installation, including all the downloaded software packages, you can restore the backup image and restart the installation. During the installation process, click the grid window to activate the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool window, and close the administration tool window by using the Close button. \n\n\nIf you do not have a backup of the server, you can undo the installation to the point of the time-out issue, and rerun the installation: \n 1.  Uninstall Content Engine Server by running /opt/IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/ce_uninstaller and deleting the /opt/IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine directory. \n 2.  Open the /opt/IBM/cpit/install-scripts/cpit.properties file for editing. \n 3.  Change all instances of .tar.gz file extensions to .tar. \n 4.  Set all values for the parameters PROCESSED_1 through PROCESSED_11 to YES. \n 5.  Set all values for the parameters PROCESSED_12 through PROCESSED_23 to NO. \n 6.  Save your changes to the /opt/IBM/cpit/install-scripts/cpit.properties file. \n 7.  Make a backup copy of the CDRoot/cpit.properties file. \n 8.  Copy the edited /opt/IBM/cpit/install-scripts/cpit.properties file to the CDRoot directory, overwriting the cpit.properties file in that location. \n 9.  Set the permission of the /opt/IBM/cpit/install-scripts directory to 777. \n 10. Restart the CPIT installation program. \n 11. When a grid-like screen displays, click the screen to activate the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool. \n 12. Close the tool by using the Close button, then clicking Yes on the exit confirmation window.",

    "question": "After using Maximo 7.6.0.8 from Chrome for a while (an hour?) my session became \"dead\". I could type in the \"Find Navigation Item\" box in the sidenav, but clicking on the selections went nowhere. Clicking on Sign Out didn't work, either. But there were loads of these errors in the logs for me. What's going wrong?\n\n\n\nThis dW Answers question is about an IBM document with the Title:\nSECJ0371W Warning Message Additional Information",

      "session; cache; logout; login; timeout; time out; LTPA TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What happens when the Security Cache, LTPA Token timeout, and session time out? \n\nANSWER\nQuestion 1 \nWhat happens when the Security Cache times out? Will the user be asked to re-login?\n\nAnswer 1 \nNo. When using single sign-on (SSO), the Security Cache will refresh from the LTPA Token. If your LTPA Token is also expired, then the user will be asked to re-login. Also, the cache timeout period is reset every time that entry is hit. So, if the entry is hit 9 minutes into the 10 minute timeout period, the clock is reset at that time. So, instead of timing out in another minute, it is now reset for another 10 minutes, then if it's hit again in that time, it will get extended again. \n\nWhen using Local operating system for authentication, the user will be asked to login when the session times out, not the security cache. \n\nIn V6.1, the Federated Repository has it's own cache settings. See the link under Related Information. \n\nQuestion 2 \n\n 1. Using a browser, we accessed a secured application, we provided the UserID (UserA) and a valid PW (Password1). A token was created. So far everything is working fine. \n    \n 2. You manually changed the password for UserA in the LTPA (LDAP or custom registry) from Password1 to Password2. \n 3. Using a new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the new password (Password2) a token was created and again everything is working as expected. \n    \n 4. Using a another new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the old password (Password1). You were surprised to notice that a token was created and UserA was able to access the application. \n\n\nAnswer 2 \nThe old password takes up to 1.5 times the security cache to disappear. It will also expire at the end of the LTPA token timeout. \n\nIn IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.0.2 and later, you can purge a user from the security cache using an MBean interface. See the Related Information at the end of this article. \n\n\nQuestion 3 \nI want to force my users to re-login after a set \"inactivity timeout\" period. How is WebSphere Application Server supposed to work with regard to session timeouts and LTPA timeout. Answer 3 \nSee the answer to this question in item 9 of the following developerWorks article:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1003_botzum/1003_botzum.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1003_botzum/1003_botzum.html]\n\n\nQuestion 4 \nIf this is the case, can we expire or delete the LTPAToken cookie when the session expires? If so, what mechanism should we use? \n\nAnswer 4\nYou can manually perform a form-based logout (as described in the Information Center) to request that the LTPAToken cookie be destroyed in the web browser, but within WebSphere Application Server, there is no functionality to automatically perform the form-based logout when the session times out. This would have to be performed programmatically.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Federated Repository cache settings [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/uwim_ldapperfsettings.html]\nAuthentication cache settings [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/usec_sec_domains_cache.html]"

Setup your environment to utilize Project-Based\n   Authorizations as documented in the SmarTeam - Editor\n   Administrator Guide.\n   2. Create a Test Project and enable Project Based\n   authorization for it.\n   1. Launch SmarTeam and login to your test database with\n   administrator or other user having Project Manager authority\n   to your Test Project.\n   2. Launch CATIA (or SolidWorks)\n   3. In CATIA, connect to the SmarTeam Integration (SmarTeam ->\n   Connect).\n   4. Save the CATIA Product to SmarTeam as follows -\n   a. SmarTeam -> Save\n   ==> The Project Manager window is presented.\n   b. Select the Test Project from the Projects list.\n   c. Enter a file name\n   d. Select the following option check-boxes:\n   * Add to Desktop\n   * Link to Project (selected by default)\n   * Secured By\n   * Propagate Security\n   * Create/Update BOM\n   e. Click in the empty space of the Documents Tree window\n   (there can be separate click or double click)\n   ==> The following selections are now un-selected -\n   * Add to Desktop\n   * Secured By\n   * Propagate Security\n   * Create/Update BOM\n   ==> The following check-box selections are low lighted and no\n   longer selectable -\n   * Secured By\n   * Propagate Security\n   5. Try to select \"Secured By\" and \"Propagate Security\"\n   options.\n   ==> These selections remain low lighted and can not be\n   selected.\n   The user must Cancel the Save operation and execute it again.\n   NOTES:\n   Issue is not limited to CATIA Integration, also occurs with\n   SolidWorks Integration.\n   There is a next workaround exists, but it is not intuitive:\n   5.\n   a) Select needed Project / Folder and DO Uncheck / Check of\n   the checkbox \"Link to Project\"\n   After that choosing and signing any additional check-boxes in\n   Project Manager is possible, any check-box is available for\n   choosing:\n   * Link to Project (un selected and selected firstly)\n   * Add to Desktop\n   * Secured By\n   * Propagate Security\n   * Create/Update BOM\n   ==> These selections DOES NOT remain low lighted and CAN be\n   selected (after re-check \"Link to Project\").\n   The user MUST NOT Cancel the Save operation and execute it\n   again.\n   Please see attached movie.\n   Important Notes:\n   1. While clicking on the \"Link to Project\" box to first\n   deselect it and then select it again (in the Workaround) does\n   make the other check boxes available to select, but this is\n   not intuitive.\n   2. Clicking on blank (dead) space after setting up the\n   Project Manager panel (entering the file name, selecting the\n   Project, Folder, Document, etc. and making the appropriate\n   check box\n   selections) should always reset all selections, not some of\n   them and not some of the time.\n   Really, in the described in Scenario 1 case, the Project and\n   Folder remain to be selected also after uncheck of \"Link to\n   Project\", but it is not clear why and what logic is used.\n   It is not clear (not intuitive), should we select them one\n   more time or not after even de-select \"Link to Project\" in\n   the Workaround?\n   3. The behavior in this panel (Project Manager) is not\n   consistent with clicking in the dead space in the SmarTeam\n   Editor Documents Tree.\n   In EDR, a click in dead space will instantly deselect\n   whatever is selected in the documents Tree.\n   Here in this Project Manager panel, the behavior depends on\n   what order you clicked on things.\n   If you click on an object in the Documents Tree just before\n   clicking in dead space, the object in the Documents Tree\n   remains selected, but the check boxes become unselected.\n   The stray click should wipe out all selections, including the\n   ones in the Document Tree, regardless of what was last\n   clicked on.\n   This panel should behave consistently with other SmarTeam\n   panels.\n   Scenario 2:\n   Clicking on or near the low lighted check box \"Propagate\n   Security\" should not toggle the \"Link to Project\" check box.\n   Clicking near the low lighted check box \"Secure By\" should\n   not toggle the \"Link to Desktop\" check box.\n   In the scenario 1, after #4 if to click on or near the low\n   lighted check box \"Propagate Security\" should not toggle the\n   \"Link to Project\" check box, or any other field.\n   In the scenario 1, after #4 if to click on or near the low\n   lighted check box \"Secure By\" should not toggle the \"Link to\n   Desktop\" check box, or any other field.\n   And, clicking over low lighted selections should not change\n   anything.\n   Scenario 3:\n   While performing Scenario 1 usually \"Link to Project\" check\n   box remained to be checked after click / double click in\n   project browser window.\n   Sometimes it is grayed out, and sometimes it is selectable.\n   It is wrong since after click \"anywhere\" this check box\n   should be also un-selected.\n   Example:\n   - several cases while it is grayed out are not clear and not\n   intuitive (it is not clear how to return it to be\n   selectable).\n   - while we are going after click \"anywhere\" to choose another\n   Project or Folder, we do not sure what is really selected, if\n   the \"link to Project' was chosen all the time.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  empty\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  Behavior of Project Manager is inconsistent and not intuitive\n   There are several scenarios that are asked to be fixed:\n   Scenario 1:\n   Clicking in Project Manager browser window makes \"Secured By\"\n   option unavailable\n   From CATIA or SolidWorks, perform SmarTeam Save operation,\n   then in the Project browser of Project Manager, click on\n   empty space.\n   Result: the \"Secured By\" and other options becomes\n   de-selected and unavailable.\n   SETUP:\n   1.

After a\n   successful Estimation, the user is not able to complete an\n   Acceptance of the version as it simply hangs for several\n   minutes, and the user is forced to quit their browser session\n   and the version is never accepted.\n   \n   All of the above functionality was fully working and tested,\n   before we began to see this behavior late last week.  We suspect\n   that these defects are related to the hot fixes that were\n   deployed over the previous weekend.\n   \n   In fact there are two related problems here\n   \n   First let me explain the basic setup to create both the\n   problems:\n    a. Create a CU Estimation  which contains more than one\n   Compatible Units (CUs) which may consist of child CUs.\n    b. Ensure that the CU also has at least one Material associated\n   and its child CU has at least one Labor and Tool\n    b. Associate a Work Order that has tasks associated through its\n   job plans.\n    c. Associated Work Order is in WAPPR state.\n   \n   Problem 1\n    a. Select Action - Perform Estimation\n    b. It gives an error as seen in the screen - The estimation\n   process completed but did not find task type(s) CONST_ETRANS\n   (Task: 50) on the target work order\n     The task list in this error varies based on the materials in\n   the CU. It seems that the CU tasks are not being copied to the\n   Work Order during this process.\n     There is absolutely no errors in the WAS system or Maximo logs\n   for this.\n    c. This error relates to the following msgkey and group pair\n     msgkey = taskTypeWarning\n     msggroup = plusdcuest\n    The mystery was that I did not find this msgkey being called\n   from any custom or plusd code installed in the system.\n    d. In spite of the error message the Status of the CUE gets\n   changed to ESTIMATED.\n   \n   Problem 2\n    a. Select Action - Perform Acceptance\n    b. This action seems to be hanging. the hour glass keeps\n   showing up in the screen.\n    c. there are again no logs for this action.\n    d. the only way out is to kill the process.\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   Tested by IBM rep on out of the box Core and T&D, unable to\n   reproduce.\n   Applied same Core and T&D hotfixes as client, along with manual\n   changes\n   and re-tested and still unable to replicate.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   * USERS AFFECTED: NA                                           *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: IBM Maximo Asset Management Version     *\n   *                      6.2.3 Hot Fix Build :036                *\n   *                                                              *\n   *                      Utilities 6.3.2  Build 074              *\n   *                                                              *\n   *                      Db= Oracle                              *\n   *                                                              *\n   *                      websphere                               *\n   *                                                              *\n   *                      While performing the estimate on the    *\n   *                      CUE Version, a pop window appeared      *\n   *                      stating that process did not find task  *\n   *                      types \"Const_ESRVC (Task 120)\",         *\n   *                      \"Const_ETRANS (Task 110)\", \"Const_GBORE *\n   *                      (Task 130)\".

This should have created 3 additional\n   task types on the Work Order, but it only created 2.\n   \n   All behavior is linked to situations where one or more task\n   types on the CU Estimate do not have a corresponding task type\n   \n   on the Work Order/Job Plan. User receives an information window\n   that states that the related WO does not have tasks for the\n   non-matching task types on the CUE. The CUE 'hangs' on the\n   Perform Acceptance task.  After a successful Estimation, the\n   user is not able to complete an Acceptance of the version as it\n   simply hangs for several minutes, and the user is forced to\n   quit their browser session and the version is never accepted.\n   All of the above functionality was fully working and tested,\n   \n   before we began to see this behavior late last week.  We\n   suspect that these defects are related to the hot fixes that\n   were\n   \n   deployed over the previous weekend.\n   \n   In fact there are two related problems here First let me\n   explain the basic setup to create both the problems:\n   \n   a. Create a CU Estimation  which contains more than one\n   Compatible Units (CUs) which may consist of child CUs.\n   \n   b. Ensure that the CU also has at least one Material associated\n   and its child CU has at least one Labor and Tool\n   \n   b. Associate a Work Order that has tasks associated through its\n   job plans.\n   \n   c. Associated Work Order is in WAPPR state.\n   \n   Problem 1\n   \n   a. Select Action - Perform Estimation\n   \n   b. It gives an error as seen in the screen - The estimation\n   process completed but did not find task type(s) CONST_ETRANS\n   \n   (Task: 50) on the target work order The task list in this error\n   varies based on the materials in the CU. It seems that the CU\n   tasks are not being copied to the Work Order during this\n   process.\n   \n   There is absolutely no errors in the WAS system or Maximo logs\n   for this.\n   \n   c. This error relates to the following msgkey and group pair\n   msgkey = taskTypeWarning msggroup = plusdcuest\n   \n   The mystery was that I did not find this msgkey being called\n   from any custom or plusd code installed in the system.\n   \n   d. In spite of the error message the Status of the CUE gets\n   changed to ESTIMATED.\n   \n   Problem 2\n   \n   a. Select Action - Perform Acceptance\n   \n   b. This action seems to be hanging. the hour glass keeps\n   showing up in the screen.\n   \n   c. there are again no logs for this action.\n   \n   d. the only way out is to kill the process.\n   \n   Tested by IBM rep on out of the box Core and T&D, unable to\n   reproduce.\n   \n   Applied same Core and T&D hotfixes as client, along with manual\n   changes and re-tested and still unable to replicate.\n   \n   LOCAL FIX:\n   \n   Non\n   \n   ===============================================\n   \n   Jerry Miller 11/5/09\n   \n   The first part of this issue is working as designed.  If the\n   task type is not found on the work order and the Maxvars to\n   create tasks is true, Maximo will warn the user that the task\n   type was not found.  If this is a mistake, then the user has a\n   chance to fix this before running Perform Acceptance.  If its\n   not a mistake, the user can ignore this warning knowing that\n   the Perform Acceptance action will create the tasks for the new\n   task type(s).

The topic was \"Troubleshooting Notes/Domino NRPC Mail Routing issues.\" \n\nCONTENT\n\n\n\nIBM hosted an Open Mic webcast with Lotus Development and Support Engineers on 9 May 2012 on the topic of \"Troubleshooting Notes/Domino NRPC Mail Routing issues.\" The slides and recording of the event are posted below. \n\n\nFor more information about our Open Mic webcasts, visit the IBM Collaboration Solutions Support Open Mics [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/support/lotus-open-mics/] page.\n\nYou can see questions posted prior to the event at this forum post [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/nd85forum.nsf/DateAllThreadedWeb/e73e9b33b9daf305852579d2004129dd?OpenDocument].\n\nQuestions and Answers from the web chat and phone:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a command to show what tasks have a hold on the mail.box? \n\nA: Yes, you can use the command \"show router show queue\" to show when mail is delayed, or you can run an NSD and that will show you what has a handle on the mail.box \n\n\n\nQ: My server is showing the error message \"Router : number of memory segments exceeded\". What would cause this? \n\nA: This is an indication of a memory problem. Collect and NSD and also run a memory dump by issuing the following server console command: load server -m. This dump file is placed in the IBM_TECHNICAL_SUPPORT folder. When you've collected these files, contact Lotus Support and we can analyze these to be more specific about what is causing the problem and helping to resolve it. \n\n\n\nQ: How can I check to see if Router or the SMTP task is running ? \n\nA: Show tasks on the Domino console \n\n\n\nQ: I believe that anti-virus products mark the messages in MAIL.BOX as \"DEAD\" or \"HELD\", is this correct? \n\nA: Anti-virus products usually mark messages as HELD to prevent the Router from processing the message \n\n\nQ: How many router instances can a server have running? \n\nA: Only one router instance can be run per Domino instance, but you can host more than one Domino instance on a partitioned server \n\n\nQ: I receive \"Error transferring to mail.global.xxx.xxx.com; SMTP Protocol Returned a Permanent Error 550 5.4.1 Relay Access Denied\". How do I correct this? \n\nA: This error indicates that Domino was successful in connecting to the recipient server, but the recipient server is having an issue. It may be that the recipient server is not an open relay. \n\n\n\nQ: If the size of an attachment has a limit and if a mail comes in with the size more than that limit, will the mail be in server mail.box or in the local mail.box? \n\nA: If the message size reaches the limit, messages will arrive to your Domino server mail.box and the router will reject the message and send a Delivery Failure Report back to the sender. The mail will be deleted from the mail.box. \n\n\n\nQ: If a mail message is in the server mail.box as a held or dead message, how can I automatically get that mail out of the mail.box? \n\nA: We do not know of an \"automatic\" way to releasing messages from the mail.box. You can remove them by using space saver options. \n\n\n\nQ: We have two Connection Documents. Out of the two, how do we make sure that one of them has the highest priority for mail routing? The second one should only work if the first server is down. \n\nA: When we're looking to make a connection, we're first going to go by cost and then by hops. If those are equal, we're going to fall back on the name of the server. So, whichever server falls first alphabetically, that is the one that we are going to use. In a failover situation such as this, if the first server alphabetically is really the one you want to use under most circumstances, then you can really have the Connection Documents similarly configured with a routing cost of 1 on both of them. If the first server is unavailable, it will go to the second connection. If the one you want to use falls second alphabetically, you will configure your Connection Documents by having a routing cost of 1 for the primary connection and a routing cost of 2 for the secondary connection. A NOTES.INI parameter that will be helpful when connections have the same cost and the first connection is not available is DebugRouterUseCostBiasDecision=1. This will move to the second connection to route the message. \n\n\n\nQ: When setting up a cluster, what is the best recommended way to route mail into that cluster ? Would it be NNN or by Connection Documents via cluster name? \n\nA: By Connection Docs via cluster name is the way to go so that any server that is up and running is ready to handle the message. \n\n\n\nQ: Sometimes we notice mail in the mail.box, but when we try to open the message, we get a pop-up that it is a non-existent document. What could be happening? \n\nA: This indicates that the message has already routed and you are seeing a remnant of the message in the view of the mail.box. One easy way to clean these up is to issue a \"tell router c\" command, which is in-place compaction of the router and will clear out those ghost messages. \n\n\n\nQ: I enabled additional debugging because I am seeing error messages in the log. Every time my Barracuda sends SMTP mail to my Domino server, I get \"Error getting host name for the IP address the remote server is not a known TCPIP host\". Is the host name of the Barracuda something that should be set in DNS or is this something that I should be able to configure in a Connection Document? \n\nA: Something to check would be to do a reverse DNS lookup. There really is no reason that Domino would have to resolve an incoming connection unless it is trying to do a verification in the DNS. Go to Router SMTP Restrictions and Controls -> SMTP Inbound Controls tab -> there are couple of sections here to check. In the \"Inbound Connection Controls\" section, the first field \"Verify connecting host name in DNS\"; if that is enabled, that may be what is causing a problem here. Also look at \"Inbound Sending Controls\" and \"Verify senders domain in DNS\". If this doesn't help pinpoint your issue, we should work with you in a PMR. \n\n\n\nQ: When I try to delete a dead message from mail.box, I get a message saying \"Cannot change UNID\" \n\nA: We suspect this could be the anti-virus program that is trying to change the UNID. If you are unsure if this is the cause of the problem, this requires a PMR for us to work with you to run debug and get more specific. \n\n\n\nQ: We are going through a rebrand soon. What is the difference in the Global Domain Document between the \"Alternate Internet Domain Aliases\" field and \"Local Primary Internet Domain\"; specifically, if we move down the current domain to \"Alternate Internet Domain Aliases\" and replace the current with the new one. What ramifications does that have? \n\nA: There really is not much of a difference. As long as the name is listed in one of those fields you are going to be ok. Even if your primary name was listed as an alias, router would know to use it. One thing to be aware of, if on the Router SMTP Basics tab -> Address Lookup field -> when changing the Internet Domain, address lookup means that we are going to look for an exact match for the full internet address. In the case where we don't find an exact match and you have \"fullname only\" enabled, if we are searching an internet address based on an Alternate Internet Domain Alias, we will actually do a second lookup for an address based on the primary internet domain to look for a match. So you can see how if you switch an internet domain from primary to alternate, or visa versa, it could change whether an address is successfully found or not. \n\n\n\nQ: How can I display routing tables and the cost which will tell how a server selects a path to another server? \n\nA: If you are using a NNN, the routing will happen in an alphabetical order. When router is building its routing tables, the router is going to take the least cost, or easiest, path to route. That is determined when the router is started up and every few minutes it will re-evaluate. DebugRouter=3 will give some more information as well. To see a path to one particular server, use \"Trace <Servername>\". And \"Tell router dump routing tables\". \n\n\n\nQ: How can you control whether the mail routes based on server-hub-server or a server-to-server direct connection when everything is in the same NNN? Is there a way to force mail routing to go through server-to-hub-server connection? \n\nA: Even though they are in the same NNN, you can use a Connection Document and set the appropriate routing cost. If they are in the same NNN, a Connection Document is not necessary, but if one exists, Domino will use it. \n\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif][/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023930&aid=2]May092012_OpenMic_NRPCRouting.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023930&aid=1]\n\n\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif][/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023930&aid=4] Notes_Domino NRPC Mail Routing Issues Open Mic May 9 2012 (edited).mp3 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023930&aid=3]\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Troubleshooting SMTP inbound/outbound issues open mic r [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023670]\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PUBLICATION DATE\n 2012/1/18",

We host about 20 different domains, and currently all users can receive email from any of the domains via a short name or alias. How can I restrict this to only a single or smaller subsets of same (they are hosted in the same Domino Domain/Directory)? \n\nA. So you want user1@domain1.com to not receive mail sent to user1@domain2.com, where domain2 is set as an alias in the Global Domain Document? \n\nQ. Correct.. Currently all our SMTP domains are listed on the Global Domain doc. I think I may need to break these out individually, but am not sure. In other words, we have one local primary domain, and all of the other domains listed in the Alternate Aliases area. \n\nA. Create a separate Global Domain document for each Internet Domain you have. Also, enable Full name only instead of Full name and local part under the Configuration document > Router / SMTP > Basics. Also, be sure to cycle the SMTP server whenever you make changes to the Global Domain doc. \n\n\n\nQ. What is the most common business case to put the SMTP task on another machine, such as SendMail? Seems like most SMTP tasks are handled natively by Domino just fine. \n\nA. SMTP will accept anything that is intended to be sent to the domain that the Domino server is configured. We are lenient with what we receive, and strict with what we send. \n\n\n\nQ. We occasionally get incoming messages held in the mail.box for no apparent reason. Running a \"route *\" command delivers the message, but I'm at a loss why this sometimes happens. \n\nA. Need more information. Are these messages intended for local delivery, or are they being routed to the Internet? Messages going out to the Internet are placed into a Retry state, if there's issue attempting to send the message. We retry 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and then every 45 minutes for 24 hours (by default). This is also configurable. \n\n\n\nQ. We have one domain, test.com, and many subdomains, xx.test.com, that are set up as alternate domains in the Global Domain document. Is there any helpful reason to set up different Global Domain documents for each subdomain? \n\nA. This should be fine. However, don't use wild card subdomains, for example, *.test.com, as this does not work. Each subdomain must be defined. \n\n\n\nQ. So all Domino servers should have two mail.boxes? \n\nA. Domino mail servers should have at least two mail.boxes and, depending on hardware, you may want even more than that. Refer to IBM Support Technote #:1148438: \" Determining the number of mailboxes required for a server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21148438].\" \n\n\n\nQ. Can we use DNS names in these fields? \n\nA. Not sure which fields you are referring to; however, most fields support both IP addresses and DNS names. An IP address within square brackets avoids DNS lookups and uses the IP value within the square brackets. Also, if you mouse-over the field, Help will usually pop up and tell you exactly what you can use. \n\n\n\nQ. For Domino servers that relay SMTP mail from internal non-Domino systems to Domino mail users, do you have any recommendations for gathering statistics on which systems are sending SMTP mail through Domino and the volume of mail that they send? \n\nA. Reports, Message Tracking, Stats, and Logs can help, but we do not have tools that will specifically obtain the information you refer to. \n\n\n\nQ. Any work in progress to allow email sent from a Notes client to a Traveler user to allow body of email to be seen only by the recipient when prevent copying is selected? Currently the Traveler client is treated as a forward and the body does not show on the mobile device. \n\nA. We have an open requirement for it ( #BWIR-87Z53L), though currently it is not on any plan for this year. You can open a PMR with Support, if you haven't already, to give the enhancement request more weight.. \n\n\n\nQ. Is there a way to prevent faked sender addresses? The sender exists in the directory but was faked and sent to the SMTP server from an internal network. \n\nA. You could use the RouterUseFromAsSMTPOriginator=1 parameter in the Notes.ini to prevent faked sender addresses. Refer to Technote #1089673, \" Can the Domino server control the Internet mail address from the server? [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21089673]\" for more information \n\nQ. Even if the faked sender exists in the Domino directory? What exactly does this parameter do? \n\nA. Yes and no. The SMTP protocol allows exactly what you describe. You can ask for authentication to connect to SMTP but this does not make sense to an SMTP gateway since no users outside your domain could authenticate. The Notes.ini parameter might help, but the open nature of SMTP just allows these types of transfers. \n\n\n\nQ. We have four Domino SMTP gateways in our Domino environment. Is there a way to load balance the outbound messages through all four systems? Can we put a load balancer within Domino? Using a third-party load balancer should work, but are there any \"Domino-internal\" possibilities? \n\nA. Domino does not have a built-in load balancer. The closest option is through round-robin for SMTP. Internally you could use a Connection document to an SMTP cluster name from Domino spokes in a different NNN. There is an enhancement request for this functionality. Open a service request with IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html] to log an additional request for this feature under SPR #SSHE5B8TQR. \n\n\n\nQ. Outbound mail: When I send a mail message to an internal user, \"John Doe\", it routes it internally using NRPC, but when I send an email to the same user at \"john.doe@domain.com\", it goes out through our SMTP gateway and comes back in as an SMTP-routed message. How do I ensure that the email address is checked and is routed internally using NRPC? I would prefer that email to an Internet address be routed internally using NRPC instead of going out to the SMTP gateway, to the Internet, and then come back in. \n\nA. By default Domino does not allow SMTP internal transfers, but that can be changed via the Configuration document. There could be things we can do, but I would need to look into your Configuration doc. Do you have a Global Domain Document? Is it configured correctly? Refer to Technote #1297369, \" Understanding the Lotus Domino Global domain document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21297369].\" If this does not help, I would recommend opening a PMR so we can look into this deeper. \n\n\n\nOTHER RELEVANT TECHNOTES \nTechnote #1568008: \" Knowledge Collection: Common Lotus Notes/Domino Mail Routing problems [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21568008]\" \n\nTechnote #1108352: \" How do you configure Lotus Domino for secure SMTP sessions using the STARTTLS extension [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21108352]?\" \n\n\n\nENHANCEMENT REQUESTS \nQ. No promises, but feel free to post enhancement requests and business/admin justifications to the Chat or Forum, such as the outbound load balancing. How would it benefit you? What problems are you having? \n\nTraveler:  * Traveler deployments. Especially for issues with encrypted mails would be nice. Having problems with that currently.\n\n * Would also be great to have this sort of [Troubleshooting Open Mic] topic with the Traveler team.\n\n\nLoad Balancing: \nPlease allow load balancing outbound to multiple SMTP gateways from an NRPC environment. We have a very large environment that has 4 domino SMTP gateways. Inbound is load balanced, but outbound is stuck through only one of the servers. This will help with load balancing and any potential DR situation where a Domino SMTP gateway might be down due to failure or maintenance. \n * I strongly agree with the earlier comments about being able to load balance. We have two outbound SMTP gateways and two inbound. We have a switch that load-balances email on the inbound route but all Domino servers only talk to the first outbound SMTP server in the Domino Directory. So the second one only gets used when the first one is down. We would prefer to run these live-live so we can be confident we will not have any issues when one or the other fails over and to maximize throughput under normal circumstances.\n\n\nI'm not sure who on the panel was talking about using Connection docs and NNNs to do load balancing. That's not a very elegant solution. I appreciate Domino doesn't do load balancing right now, but I think there are a lot of customers who would like to see it, based on the comments on the chat and questions raised on call, so it would be good of IBM to consider how this could be introduced to the product - and I appreciate it's not going to be easy. \n\nMisc:  * Any thoughts about supporting DKIM signing?\n\n * Can we trim all input fields on the Config docs as well? Had an issue 8.5.2 where a space was appended at the end of an alias when setting up a foreign SMTP doc. Took way too much time to figure that out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. How can I verify the status of TLS (transport-layer security), i.e, whether I have the correct certificate, etc? \n\nA. We have an excellent Technote, #1108352, \" How to configure Domino for secure SMTP sessions using STARTTLS [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21108352],\" on how to set up and configure transport-layer security (TLS). If you are having problems with certain domains, then open a PMR with Support to investigate further. Meanwhile I recommend your using the Notes.ini parameter, RouterFallbackNonTLS=1, for sending out TLS messages to domains. So, if receiving systems are not properly configured, or for whatever reason you're having a problem encrypting the transaction between SMTP servers, you will still be able to get your mail off your server via SMTP unencrypted. \n\nQ. OK, so is there a quick thing I can do with telnet that can show me what my TLS settings are on my servers? \n\nA. There are some third-party tools for TLS, but I can't recall them off the top of my head. Typically, for troubleshooting certificates, for example, I'd go to https and then either local host for your server or the receiving domain's server to see if there's a problem with the certificate. And for Domino, we use the same certificate for everything--HTTP, POP, SMTP, etc. \n\nA. Also, one thing to make sure that your \"advertising\" that you accept mail over TLS, you should telnet to the server, using EHLO, which will show you the extensions that are used, including you should see STARTTLS. It won't check the certificates, but at least you'll see that your server is advertising your using TLS---or to the server to which you're trying to connect. Another thing to note is that when we say \"TLS and Domino\", it's actually negotiated SSL, not TLS. \n\n\n\n\nQ. We're running a Domino 8.5.1 environment and have a Routing profile set up within the Domino primary Address Book to forward mail to our exchange domain as well. We are getting a number of Delivery Failure Reports (DFRs) for people who are using Notes 8.5.1 because of the Recent Contacts caching. We are trying to determine how extensive the problem is. Are there any statistics or something else we should look at to determine how many DFRs are being generated on each mail server. I did do a \"showstatmail\" and saw a mail transfer failure count, but that could be any type of failure. So, is there anything I could be looking at? \n\nA. Unfortunately I don't know of any statistics that will differentiate whether a failure is specifically due the Recent Contacts. \n\nQ. So the mail transfer failures are totally DFRs, correct? \n\nA. Yes, it's just the overall failures, not specific to any one type of failure. Note that there is a statistic, Mail.reports.failure, that gives the the number of failure reports generated but, again, it doesn't indicate what the reasons are. \n\n\n\n\nQ. Regarding load balancing outbound mail to gateways: If we're using SMTP between mail servers or other servers in Domino SMTP gateways, we can do it via load balancing but if we use NRPC , then are we out of luck? \n\nA. Yes, there's no true way to do load balancing within Domino. We do not have a built in load balancer. Usually when asked this, I suggest using separate Notes Named Networks (NNN) and using Connection docs to the cluster name from the spokes or hub. but again, it's more a case of \"pre-meditated\" load-balancing using round robin. There's nothing in Domino that will come in and split things up based on traffic. There are 3rd-party load balancers that you may consider. \n\nQ. Would you recommend a mixed environment of NRPC and SMTP where SMTP from these servers to Domino gateways, or is that not recommended? \n\nA. Whatever works better for you. Either would work fine; generally, we recommend using NRPC between the servers internally, You can also loose functions that rely on NPRC routing, but there's no restriction on using SMTP. \n\n\n\n\nQ. We have certain servers ostensibly identified as SMTP Outbound and others as SMTP Inbound. I'd like to get a rough idea of the kind of throughput---obviously this will be based on the boxes themselves---in each of the boxes. Is NRPC to SMTP conversion and SMTP to NRPC conversion roughly similar, so we should be able to get similar amounts of mail through? \n\nIn other words: If we've got, for instance, and SMTP Outbound server and if it were able to process 10K emails, therefore converting NRPC to SMTP, could we similarly expect the server to able to process roughly the same amount of emails (10K) via SMTP to NRPC? Is that conversion workload similar or are they completely different in terms of the loads they place on the server? \n\nA. I think you're talking about a compound document to a MIME conversion. Typically when you're sending messages out to the Internet, there's a setting on the client to send Internet messages in a MIME format. In that way, there wouldn't be any conversion of a message that's routing out via SMTP to the Internet. And in the Person doc by default setting \"Keep in sender's format\", so that when receive a message in from the Internet it will be preserved and sent to the end user in MIME format, so there's no conversion Inbound. The only way it would be converted if the setting \"Prefers Notes rich text\" is enabled; then the msg. would be converted from MIME to a compound document for that user. So, by default the message is set to MIME both outbound and inbound. \n\nQ. OK, so provided we're not doing any of that translation, it should be roughly the same. \n\nA. Yes, and if you have users who are using third-party clients, it's recommended that their preference is set to \"MIME\". So, messages in their mail file don't need to be converted to a MIME format to render in the third-party clients. \n\n\n\n\nQ. We have 48 download servers with 48 clustermates. With respect to the router, when we have a problem with primary servers, we don't have an easy way to determine whether the router is properly flowing messages to the clustermates, or even if that's possible. \n\nA. We can certainly increase the level of debugging so we can see what the router is doing. We've got debugrouter=3, and we have log_mailrouting=40, which are two dynamic .INI settings that show what the router's doing. Also, we could do a \"tell router show\" to determine the state of the messages are with respect to the router. \n\nQ. OK, the problem is that I have so many servers and usually it's just one server that's down; I do see where the router seems to back up messages and they're not flowing to the clustermate, Is there something inline I could look at while this is happening to see if failover is occurring? \n\nA. Yes, \"tell router show\". Also, you can enable the.INI setting, routerdebugclusterfailover. \n\n\n\n\nQ. When we enable Directory Assistance (DA) for LDAP authentication with iNotes, we see an issue in that SMTP is going out trying to do a handshake with our LDAP server. Is there a way to disable that, so it doesn't attempt this handshake? We talked to Support, who said we need to have our LDAP keys locally on our Domino Directory, but we are unable to do that. We feel that there should be a way to disable it, and we told that this would be addressed in Domino 8.5.3, but we're running that version and the issue has resurfaced. \n\nA. So, if I understand this correctly: Your SMTP server is going out to your LDAP Directory to resolve incoming messages? \n\nQ. Yes, but it's not supposed to: We put our LDAP Directory in our Directory Assistance database for HTTP authentication for iNotes, but since doing that, we're getting SMTP hangs and the call stacks indicate SMTP is attempting to handshake with our LDAP server. \n\nA. For straightforward LDAP, I'd need to refer you to our Web Server team who support that. But the router SMTP will use its primary address book and anything that's available in the DA database to try to resolve incoming messages and even if DA is not available, there's a chance it will accept msgs for people that don't exist because of directory availability. The ability to prevent the SMTP task from looking up to the LDAP directory is something I am not aware of, and would have to refer that to the Web Server team to see if there's a fix for it. This is something that needs more investigation, but typically Domino will use any and all directories to it, to resolve addresses of incoming message. I think this would require a PMR so we could examine this further. \n\n\n\n\nQ. Regarding security on Inbound controls, when we try to stop traffic to the Domino machine using Inbound connection controls allowing only from specific domains or IP addresses. This cuts down the traffic; however, we have a problem with mobile users using SMTP to send mail via POP3 client; having very very different IPs coming up, and not from providers on a specific domains so we can't identify them. Any policies that would work with that? \n\nA. Notes Traveler would be good alternative for mobile devices. Thing is: When locking down SMTP servers to only allow traffic from specific ranges or IP addresses to connect to you, these mobile devices can be coming in from any address; using DHCP, we'll never know what they're coming in under. So, that just adds to the complexity here. Traveler is an excellent alternative as it allows synchronization of a hand-held device directly with the mail file. \n\nQ. That is why as far as possible we we go and it's fine, but still have some users that can use this. So, no chance. \n\nA. Is it so that these clients can send mail? Is that the idea? \n\nQ. Yes, they want to send mail using the infrastructure. \n\nA. OK, well, POP3 and IMAP you pull messages down from the server and can actually configure these clients to send mail from the carrier/ISP they're on and that should be a viable solution. So they wouldn't need to worry about where msgs are coming in from. the connections \n\nQ. We see with at least one, we get not very specific inbound addresses from the relay servers used; e.g., a network in Germany seems to send mail under a wide variety of IP addresses. \n\nA. Yes, that's a tough one, when you're limiting who you get connections from for authenticating to send mail. \n\nQ. So is it best to stay with a very strict usage of \"Allow connections from\", to keep traffic on the server down, and increase enforcement of people to use Traveler, IMAP, etc? \n\nA. Well that depends. Do you have a third-party filter out in front of your server, such as Postini; in that case, you'd just restrict your inbound mail so you only get mail from Postini, and others couldn't connect. If Domino is to be your Gateway, then you'd want to lock down that gateway as much as possible. We've long cautioned against using SMTP authentication because we've seen a number of cases in which customers were hacked into where usernames and password dictionary attacks were conducted against servers to get in, to be able to use the Domino server as their own relay, so I would not recommend enabling \"STMP AUTH \". Instead I'd go back to the carriers of the hand-held devices to see if they could provide an SMTP relay. And you'd still be able to pull down your mail via POP3 or IMAP. \n\n\n\n\nQ. We have an issue with SMTP outbound. When there's a bad message that Domino can't transfer, it creates a queue of msgs pending. SMTP inbound continues to work, router continues to work, but SMTP outbound queue gets built up. Do you have any means--a parameters maybe--that can do a load balancing to send these messages to the other SMTP server or to open other threads to transfer the rest of the messages? \n\nA. That used to be a problem with Domino versions earlier than 7.0.3. \n\nQ. We haven't had the problem in a long time, and we upgraded Domino to 8.5.3 recently and the problem reoccurred. It's happened three times in two months, all with Japanese emails containing Japanese characters. When we remove these messages from mail.box, everything works fine. We opened a PMR with IBM but they couldn't reproduce it. \n\nA. Are you sending directly to the Internet or using a relay host? \n\nQ. We use the IronPort device. \n\nA. That's probably why we couldn't reproduce it; we were sending directly out to Internet. \n\nQ. I even tried it in a test environment that is the same way, and mail go out fine directly to Internet. Debugging revealed that it's getting stuck after the data is sent, and then the reports says that Domino closes the connection. \n\nA. Have you opened a ticket with IronPort? \n\nQ. No, but I cannot reproduce the issue with IronPort on. If I move the message on, it will transfer. I can place the message back into queue, and there's no problem. So the problem is with Domino. Are there additional threads that can handle the other messages? \n\nA. Absolutely. Again, since 7.0.3, if there's a problem email, it's pushed aside and other mail continues to route behind it. That's why I asked if you opened a ticket with I-import because Domino is completely able to create separate queues for an email that we cannot move on, and process the rest of the mail behind them. \n\nQ. Well, I-import is able to handle multiple message and multiple connections, so we don't have limits on connections from the Domino servers. \n\nA. When you get down to the data portion of the message, there may be something that IBM is not seeing, and you may need a sniffer to look at the communication between the two applications to understand why I-import is not accepting that message. In any case, this issue needs a PMR. \n\nQ. Our PMR is still open, and I have copies of the msgs. Other thing: We have two internal Domino servers, and all the SMTP mail goes to the server listed first; is there any way to load balance this so mail goes to the other server? \n\nA. Again, Domino does not have built-in load balancing. The closest thing to this in a Notes environment is by creating a Connection document to the cluster name. The cluster gateway would have to be in its own Notes Named Network and basically, the hubs and spokes behind that cluster, you would have a Connection doc that cluster name and then you'd have a round-robin-type effect in which the servers would pick up that connection and handle the msg. \n\n\n\n\nQ. Regarding a specific message we saw when sending out mail to a company from a Domino server, we got the information, \"Reported responsible address failure,\" error from the receiving company. Problem is that we can send mail from that same Domino environment to other users via that same address in that same company, but only from a specific mailbox; otherwise, we get the error every time. Any idea why? \nFrom RFC 4407 from 2006, it seems to be related to the sender's From address recognition that the receiving party acknowledges this as a failure. \n\nA. In this case, the first thing I'd do is put on a debug parameter, SMTPClientDebug=1 (and zero to disable), to look at the Outbound SMTP conversation and have the user who's having the problem send another message. Then look at your console.log or in Misc Events view of your Log.nsf, try searching for this conversation, and see what error's reported. Sometimes the log shows a more detailed error msg than in the Delivery Failure itself. From what you've told us, it sounds like something on the receiving end is rejecting you; the debug will provide more detail and we can figure out how to proceed. Also, try using telnet from the sending server. \n\nQ. We can send mail from the sending server if it goes out from other users at that address on that Domino server, so it's one specific user on one specific mail.box, which by the way, is not a standard Notes mailbox. \n\nA. You could step through the telnet commands with the mail from your sender and the \"Receipt to\" that recipient, and maybe get more information from the telnet communication with that server, along with using the SMTPClientDebug parameter that Sarah mentioned. Another thing: I've seen a case in which a period was appended to the domain, or something was slightly different that was not easily noticed that came from Recent Contacts, so you want to check for that as well. \n\nQ. I saw another thing in that box that could be a problem; there maybe were several \"Froms\" in the To mail document and we don't know where that came from. So the From address is normally that one in the Domino item environment, and then we had a forwarded From as another item and have no idea how Domino translates that or where it comes from. \n\nA. Domino builds a msg based on several factors. For msgs going out, it looks at the ID and pulls info from the ID, the Location doc of the client, the Internet address field of the Person doc, and the Global Domain doc. Also it looks the Configuration doc to look up Internet addresses for all Notes addresses leaving the local Internet domain. so that's something that should be enabled. Basically, if the Global Domain doc can't look up the Internet address, it builds one with what you have set on the Conversions tab. So as long as everything is properly configured, Domino will do its best to build a good, reply-able address. \n\nQ. OK, so my next step is to see what's going on in the conversation between the servers, and then look at the Console output? OK, thanks! \n\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]SMTPPrez.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023670&aid=2]SMTPPrez.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023670&aid=1] \n\nSMTP Feb_14_2012.pdf \n\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]Troubleshooting SMTP Open Mic Feb 14 2012 (edited).mp3 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023670&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023670&aid=3]\n\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PUBLICATION DATE\n 2011/12/1",

Should we get the warning message only if there is a GL\n   Account\n   on the Location record?\n   \n   Customer needs that this message does not display, even when\n   your assets or locations have no GL account associated.\n   \n   Warning message:\n   BMXAA4510E - The location and asset combination you have\n   entered would\n   default a different GL account than is currently specified on\n   the work\n   order.  Would you like to update the work order's GL account\n   based on\n   the new asset/location combination?  Clicking Cancel will\n   return you\n   with no changes.\n   \n   This is causing issue with the users as they do not know what\n   needs to\n   be done. They are confused why they should get the message when\n   the GL\n   is already there.\n   \n   We provided some workaround, however customer wants to have a\n   solution\n   on a out of the box environment, since they do not accept this\n   feature.\n   \n   Customer needs that this message does not display, even when\n   your assets or locations have no GL account associated.\n   \n   Customer said :\n   \n   I have discussed this issue with Gentiana as I feel that this\n   is still an issue and should be resolved out of the box. We\n   are aware of removing the button from the dialogue box but\n   that would be another click for user to close the dialogue\n   box that is not needed. If GL account already exists then\n   this warning message should not come upon selection of a\n   Location. Gentiana was looking into having a session with the\n   Product Manager.

Simply load the file up into your browser on an internet enabled computer and enter the authorization code and lock code. The authorization code is generated from the License Key Center [https://spss.subscribenet.com/control/ibmp/login] or provided to you by IBM.\n\nLicense Key Center [https://spss.subscribenet.com/control/ibmp/login]\n\nThe lock code is generated from the computer which needs a license. The License Authorization Wizard displays the code and you can also generate it by running the program \"echoid.exe\" which is found either in the product installation folder or in the bin sub-folder (depending on the program and platform in use). A typical lock code is a number, a dash, and then several hexadecimal characters (0-9 and A-F).\n\nExample: 4-87B3F\n\ncreateLic.html [https://www-prd-trops.events.ibm.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/createLic.html]\n\n\nCross reference information Product Component Platform Version Edition SPSS Amos Platform Independent All Versions IBM SPSS Statistics Platform Independent All Versions",

      "MustGatherDocument TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What information should I collect when I experience a problem with IBM\u00ae Datacap 9.0? \n\nANSWER\nCollecting Data for Datacap\nFor every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). Gathering this data before calling IBM support will help you to understand the problem and save time analyzing the data.\n\nCollecting data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM\u00ae Support quickly determine if: \n\u00b7 Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery).\n\u00b7 There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved.\n\u00b7 There is a defect that identifies a work around to reduce severity.\n\nLocating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix.\n\nGathering General Information\n\nFor IBM\u00ae Datacap, gather version of software, the operating system versions, whether this is a single machine installation or a multi-machine configuration, and the settings for the pertinent servers or client machines.\n\nThen, gather the following information that is specific to a Datacap problem or issue:\n\u00b7 How often does this problem occur?\n\u00b7 Can the problem be reproduced? \n\u00b7 How many users are affected by this problem? \n\u00b7 What is the business impact of this problem? \n\u00b7 Is there a work around?\n\u00b7 What Datacap component,if known, is failing?\n\n\nGathering Version Information \n\nOn the Taskmaster Server machine, locate the version.txt file in the \\Datacap folder. Provide the number after the \"IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture\" text (not the build number). \n\nWindows Application Event Logs\n\nThe Microsoft Windows application event logs may contain useful information when diagnosing your issue. Gather the application event logs from the Taskmaster Server (TMS) and the client machine (if applicable). If your problem is easily reproducible, clearing the logs prior to reproducing the issue will make transport and log review much easier.

      " RELEASE NOTES\n\nABSTRACT\n This document provides a collection of updates and corrections to the 8.1 documentation for Fix Pack 3. \n\nCONTENT\nDocumentation updates: \n\nIBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture support for IBM Security Access Manager \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045387 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045387]\nThis techdoc describes how Taskmaster Web can authenticate Taskmaster users who are already authenticated in the IBM Security Access Manager SSO environment. \n\n\nEnabling SSL for your LLLDAP configuration (LDAPS)\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045687 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045687] \nYou can enable LDAP connections over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for your LLLDAP configuration. \n\n\nCustomizing the DotEdit Verify line items panel to handle large numbers of line items \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045485 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045485] \nHandling large numbers of line items in the Verify task consumes a lot of memory, which can cause the application to hang, crash, or have issues displaying controls in the panel. You can add a scroll bar to the line items panel, which enables the application to load manageable portions of the line items at a time, instead of attempting to load all of the line items at once. This customization makes it possible to load and process thousands of line items without crashing or degrading performance. \n\n\nSetting a variable in DotEdit to prevent Image View from returning focus to the first page (Main_Page)\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045562 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045562] \nWhen you click a field on a trailing page and the field is associated with the main page, or the field does not have a zone location, focus jumps back to the first page. To keep focus on the current page, you can specify a setting to prevent focus from automatically returning to the first page. \n\n\nSetting up DotScan to undo rescanned pages\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045038 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045038] \nFor TWAIN and ISIS scanned pages, you can set up DotScan to undo rescanned pages to go back to a previous image. \n\n\nRunning verification on batches and documents\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg606.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg606.htm]\nBy default Taskmaster Web loads only the data file for the current image when a Verify task is run. You cannot run cross document or cross batch validations. To be able to run validation on an entire batch or a document, you can configure the caching option by setting the LoadDoc value in the <verify>.set.xml file to load all of the data files in the current batch or only for current document. \n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * C:\\Datacap\\ProgramSet\n * \n * \n * \n * Search > Find\n * \n * LoadDoc\n * \n * \n * \n * LoadDoc checkbox\n * \n *   * 0 - cache only the current data file \n    * 1 - cache all of the data files for the current document \n    * 2 - cache all of the data files for the current batch\n   \n   \n\nOracle database schema changes required for upgrading to IBM Datacap Taskmaster 8.1 or later\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665610 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665610]\nIf you upgrade from IBM Datacap Taskmaster v8.1.0 or earlier to v8.1 FP1 or later, and your Taskmaster databases are in Oracle, you must update the database schemas by using the manual steps described in this technote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation corrections: \n\n\nPDF: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture System Administration Guide\n(c1939532.pdf) \n\nSection: \nKeyboard shortcuts for DotScan [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.admin.doc/dcrkbs002.htm]  * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Image View\n * \n * \n * \n * Batch View\n * \n * \n * \n * Start Batch Panel\n * \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture Installation and Configuration Guide\n(c1932325.pdf)\n\nSection:\nTaskmaster RV2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dcrvi014.htm] \n\n * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nSection: \nImporting encryption keys to Taskmaster computers [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dcain010_copyto_inst_tmclientwrkstn2.htm]  * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Datacap server - C:\\Datacap\\Taskmaster\n   Datacap applications - C:\\Datacap\\Taskmaster\n   DotScan - C:\\Datacap\\DotScan\n   DotEdit - C:\\Datacap\\DotEdit\n   Datacap Studio - C:\\Datacap\\DStudio\n   Datacap FastDoc - C:\\Datacap\\FastDoc\n   Datacap Report Viewer - C:\\Datacap\\RV2\\bin\n   Datacap Web Client - C:\\Datacap\\tmweb.net\\bin\n   Datacap Web Services - C:\\Datacap\\wTM\\bin \n\n\n\n\nPDF: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture Creating Custom RV2 Reports Guide\n(c1932521.pdf)\n\nSection:\nDatacap statistics [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.customrv2.doc/dcapi000.htm] \n\n * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Application Development Guide\n(c1932515.pdf) \n\nSection: \nRecognition language settings [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg762.htm]  * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction: \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nSection: \nSkipping a verification task [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg815.htm]  * \n * Issue:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Correction: \n * \n * \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNENU Manager setup actions\n\nSection: \nApplication setup actions [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg714.htm] \n\n * \n * Issue\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * User\n * \n * Password\n * \n * Station \n * \n * blank\n * \n * \n * \n * Correction\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * SetUser\n * \n * SetStation\n * \n * SetApplication \n * \n * SetupOpenApplicationEx\n *",
      " PRODUCT README\n\nABSTRACT\n IBM Datacap 9.0.1 FP1 - Readme doc \n\nCONTENT\nAbout IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 \n\nReview this document for installation instructions and other important information before you install IBM\u00ae Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1, which cumulatively contains all feature pack updates since IBM Datacap Version 9.0.1 was released. \n\n \n\nUpgrading to IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1\n\n\nFrom v9.0.1: use the Patch Installer from Fix Central \n\nInstallation Steps \n\nPrerequisite: \n\n\u00b7 1) Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 \n\n\u00b7 Run: NDP461-KB3102436-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe \n\n \n\n\u00b7 2) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 \n\n\u00b7 Run: vcredist_x86.exe \n\n \n\nInstall: \n\n\u00b7 3) IBM Datacap 9.0.1.1 \n\n\u00b7 Run: Update.exe\n\n\nFrom v9.0.0.0, 9.0.0.1, 9.0.0.2 & 9.0.0.3: use the Full Installer from Passport Advantage \n\nInstallation Steps \n\nPrerequisite: \n\n\u00b7 1) Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 \n\n\u00b7 Run: NDP461-KB3102436-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe \n\n \n\n\u00b7 2) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 \n\n\u00b7 Run: vcredist_x86.exe \n\n \n\nInstall: \n\n\u00b7 3) IBM Datacap 9.0.1.1 \n\n\u00b7 Run: Setup.exe \n\n \n\nImportant \n\nUpdates are required only on Servers and thick client computers. No update is required for \"thin client\" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. \n\nOnce installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use \"Uninstall or change a program\" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. \n\nThe language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. \n\n \n\nAlerts! \n\n1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. \n\nThe global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\\RRS folder. The application copies are in the application DCO rules folder. \n\nCustomers must manually update the ruleset DLLs in each application where they are installed. \n\n2) When running an update, the master task configuration files are updated (Datacap\\ProgramSet) but the setting in applications are not updated (in application DCO folder). \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience problems that have been fixed. \n\nThe master task configuration is located in Datacap\\ProgramSet. The application settings are in the application DCO folder. \n\nCustomers must manually update the task setting in each application where they are installed. \n\n\nSystem requirements \n\nSelect the following link to see the hardware and software requirements for IBM Datacap. \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/softwareReqsForProduct.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/softwareReqsForProduct.html] \n\n\nSearch for \u2018Datacap\u2019, then select \"Datacap \" \n\nCheck the box \u2018Show feature packs\u2019 and select 9.0.1 for Feature Pack 1*. \n\nNew features added to IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 \n\nFor a list of new features that were added to Datacap 9.0.1 in Feature Pack 1, see:\nHighlights of IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm].\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm]\n\n\nNew Qualifications \n\n \n\nIBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 is qualified for use with: \n\n \n\n\u00b7 Microsoft Windows 10 (except for TMWeb Scanning with Twain drivers; \n\nSee \u201cKnown Limitations\u201d below for details) \n\n \n\n\u00b7 Oracle 12c (12.1.0.2.0) \n\n \n\n\u00b7 IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 FP7 \n\n \n\nIssues fixed in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 \n\n \n\nAPAR Number Summary IO23893 Clicking on QA link in tmweb - Administrator fails with error \"column named name already belongs to this datatable\" if using admin database on SQL server IO24025 Can not import file which name contains '0x905C' such as \"\u4fdd\u967a\u7533\u544aUpdated.tif\" IO24067 When customer use https + non-activeX to upload, some images will be corrupted frequently IO24082 Lineitem does not show up in Datacap Desktop Verify panel IO24102 Enhance IMail actions to use standard naming convention for ID's of pages created.

Extract the 913 iFix 005 package, and run the Update.exe file. \n\nFeature enhancements \n\nAs part of this interim fix, the following new enhancements have been added:\n\n * You can now retain the \"Fit to Width\" and \"Fit to Height\" settings during the complete logon session. A user views an image in DajeaViewer, and selects \"Fit To Height\" or \"Fit to Width\" from action menu. The image is scaled to proper zoom level in viewer, and also the selected setting of zoom level will be held on during the complete user session, and take effect until the user logs out. The new selected setting is only stored in user session temporarily, and does not replace the existing zoom level in user settings, but if the user changed zoom level in user settings, the session setting is overwritten by user settings. This feature applies to the following clients:\n   \n    * Scan client (Daeja HTML Viewer or Local Viewer)\n    * Verify client (Daeja HTML Viewer)\n    * Classify client (Daeja HTML Viewer)\n    * SpeedScan client (Daeja HTML Viewer)\n    * SpeedIndex client (Daeja HTML Viewer)\n   \n   \n * You can switch between \"Fit to Width\" and \"Fit to Height\" in the user settings. A user can switch between \"Fit to Width\" and \"Fit to Height\" in the user settings. This setting applies to Scan, Verify, Classify, SpeedScan and SpeedIndex tabs with Daeja HTML Viewer and Local Rendering Viewer.\n   \n   \n * The keyboard shortcut for moving the image in viewer has been changed from \"CTRL +ALT +P\" to \"CTRL + ALT + M\".\n\nAPARs addressed by this code fix \n\nThe following table displays the list of APARs that are fixed in IBM Datacap 9.1.3 Interim Fix 005:\n\nComponent APAR Number Description Defect ID Datacap Desktop IO26154 When using Oracle DB, a custom column in the TMBatch table shows \"Error received from aTM component\" error on Datacap Web Server. 179406 Datacap Desktop IO26155 During VSCAN, images are displayed in descending order when multiple files are imported after user selects the Open option to browse to the images in Datacap Desktop. 179098 Datacap Navigator IO26197 Resolved an error in the browser console for the BatchPrep, SpeedScan, and SpeedIndex clients, occurred when the profile failed to load. 180074 Datacap Navigator IO26197 Resolved problem that did not save the data from fields while validating in SpeedScan client. 180152 Datacap Navigator IO26197 Resolved problem that did not save the data from fields while submitting in SpeedScan client. 180453 Datacap Desktop IO26202 When using fixup or verify task, deleting a page of document, the cursor moves back to the first page, and user lost all document and page references. 179962 Actions/Document Analytics/Classification/Visual Recognition IO26209 VisualRecogClassify action does not work for PNG and compressed (.zip) files \"the pages must be the image file (.jpg, or .png) or compressed (.zip) file of images\". 179849 Datacap Desktop IO26224 Resolved problem when there were multiple Verify panels in an app, multiple delete confirmation pop-up windows were displayed. 180234 Datacap Navigator IO26225 User was unable to assign key combination to lookup hot key. 180282 Datacap Navigator IO26231 Datacap Navigator Verify runtime table fields feature displays corrupted table data with two tables that have the same ID or column name. 180400 Datacap Navigator IO26234 Fields do not display correct data after running a rule if the rule changes the page type in verify page. 180459 Datacap Navigator IO26235 Image failed to be shown in the viewer after WebSphere Application Server or wTM session times out and also during relogin. 180310 Datacap Navigator IO26237 In Datacap Navigator, Application keyboard shortcut combination, CTRL + ALT + P, does not work if viewer has the focus. 180269 Datacap Navigator IO26239 In Datacap Navigator, Daeja virtual viewer does not resize automatically. 180474 Datacap Navigator IO26247 Immediate upload does not work with documents that are created in batch. 180504 Fixed issues \n\nThe following issues are fixed in IBM Datacap 9.1.3 Interim Fix 005:\n\nComponent Defect ID Description Actions, Export, ExportDB, ExportXML 179077 Function AddToDBTotals does not support batch folders that are over 32,000,000 bytes, and causes the batch processing termination. Actions 180075 The calculation of page classification and field recognition variables by the statistics rules fail in a locale that uses comma for decimal character. Datacap Navigator 180505 SpeedIndex client shows errors with layout while upgrading from Datacap V9.1.2. Datacap Navigator 180460 Change page type does not work properly if new page type has a non-exist custom panel that is specified. Datacap Navigator 180455 Submit option is not blocked by UI validation errors in SpeedScan. Datacap Navigator 180408 Keyboard shortcuts CTRL + ALT +P do not work after moving page by keyboard. Datacap Navigator 180241 Dual viewer has no page up/down/delete in SpeedScan client.",
      "MustGatherDocument TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What information should I collect when I experience a problem with IBM\u00ae Datacap 8.1? \n\nANSWER\nCollecting Data for Datacap\nFor every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). Gathering this data before calling IBM support will help you to understand the problem and save time analyzing the data.\n\nCollecting data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM\u00ae Support quickly determine if: \n\n * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). \n * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. \n * There is a defect that identifies a work around to reduce severity.\n\n\nLocating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix. \n\nGathering General Information \n\nFor IBM\u00ae Datacap, gather version of software, the operating system versions, whether this is a single machine installation or a multi-machine configuration, and the settings for the pertinent servers or client machines. \n\nThen, gather the following information that is specific to a Datacap problem or issue:  * How often does this problem occur? \n * Can the problem be reproduced? \n * How many users are affected by this problem? \n * What is the business impact of this problem? \n * Is there a work around? \n * What Datacap component,if known, is failing?\n\nGathering Version Information \n\nOn the Taskmaster Server machine, locate the version.txt file in the \\Datacap folder. Provide the number after the \"IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture\" text (not the build number). \n\nWindows Application Event Logs\n\nThe Microsoft Windows application event logs may contain useful information when diagnosing your issue. Gather the application event logs from the Taskmaster Server (TMS) and the client machine (if applicable). If your problem is easily reproducible, clearing the logs prior to reproducing the issue will make transport and log review much easier. Please consult the Microsoft documentation for the location of the application event logs, based on your operating system version. \n\nDatacap Log files\n\nWhen providing logs, please note the date and time of the problem, to make the analysis easier. The logs required will depend on the application that was being executed when the issue occurred. The following is a list of the various Datacap components, with instructions on how to turn on logging:\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in Taskmaster Server\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635506 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635506]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in Rulerunner\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635504 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635504]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in Taskmaster Web\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635509 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635509]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging for Taskmaster Web tasks\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg210.htm%23dcadg210 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg210.htm%23dcadg210]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in FastDoc\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635501 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635501]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in DotScan\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635500 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635500]\n\n\u00b7 Enabling logging in DotEdit\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635496 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635496]\n\n\u00b7 Enable logging for IBM Datacap Taskmaster RV2 \n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661059 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661059]\n\nGathering Additonal Information\n\nDepending on what actions you were trying to complete, different data sets might be needed to support problem resolution. Depending on what aspect of the Client you were using, please also gather the following: \n\n * Web Browser version information \n * Type of database and LDAP servers and/or authentication method used \n * Brand and model of scanner used \n * TWAIN or ISIS drivers \n * Repository (brand and version) used\n\n\n\nCollection information for other components \n\nIf you can tell based on the nature of the problem or visible symptoms in the log files that the issue is related to the repository, gathering the respective log files can help speed resolution, although these files are not specifically required to start the problem resolution process. \n\nPlease refer to the repository's documentation for the log gathering process."

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n It is possible to deploy several Rule Execution Server (RES) Console in the same cluster, however there are some administrative interactions from RES components to RES console that may not work due to the presence of more than one RES management stack within the same administrative scope. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen a RES component makes an attempt to interact with a RES Console management stack (through a JMX invocation) the following exception may occur if more than one RES Console is deployed within an administrative cell: \n\n...\njava.lang.IllegalStateException \nat ilog.rules.res.mbean.util.IlrSingleMBeanInvocationHandler.invoke(Unknown Source)\n...\n\nNote: a similar exception can be seen when no RES Console is found so the first thing to verify is that a RES Console is completely deployed and that it passes the diagnostic properly before considering the issue in this present note.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe scope of the management API (JMX) is typically that of the Cell (WebSphere), Domain (Weblogic) or Partition(JBoss). RES components that interact directly with the RES Console management stack normally expect to find exactly one RES Console within the this management scope : an error can arise from not finding a RES Console management stack, as well as finding more than one.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCertain use cases are supported that involve deploying more than one RES console in a cluster, most notably for situations where a active/passive fail over is needed, see the following document for more information: Clustering Rule Execution Server (RES) management console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] \n\n\nHowever there is a number of limitations that one can face when several RES consoles are deployed within the same administrative cell, such as : \n\n 1. The use of the API ilog.rules.session.IlrManagementSession (reference [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/session/IlrManagementSession.html]) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell. \n 2. With JRules 6.x deploying RSM in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed can lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above when attempting to add an SSP through the RSM console. \n 3. With JRules 7.x DVS scenario suite executions initiated from Rule Studio to be run on a remote Java EE server in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed may fail with java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. \n 4. The use of interceptors (i.e. IlrSessionInterceptor implementations) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException or an error message such as ilog.rules.res.session.interceptor.IlrSessionInterceptorException: Unable to find RuleApp /myruleapp/myruleset for use by the interceptor. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell.\n\n\nFor situations 2. and 3. note that DVS and RSM are normally deployed in a non-production environment since they support the testing process of the rules prior to their deployment to production. So in practice it is not necessary to deploy multiple RES console instances for fail over purpose when in a testing environment. The recommendation is then to set up RES console and SSP in a testing cell that is separate from the production cell. In this testing cell, only one instance of RES console should be installed.

The IP was different than the EXT_HOST_ADDR per sandbox.cfg That internal IP Address had been propagated to jgroups_cluster.properties\n\nWe used the EXT_HOST_ADDR (which is in sandbox.cfg) so that jgroups_cluster.properties uses that one instead of the internal one that was originally set up. After the property file change, the customer was able to get the cluster working. \n\nThe reason why the customer had taken it upon themselves to do this change, was to prevent from doing multicasting on their external IP addresses. It was explained to them that in SI 5.0, we don't have to do broadcast (UDP) multicasting, but rather you can do TCP communications for node to node communications.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I configure my messaging engines for failover in WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.1 and 7.2? \n\nCAUSE\nOut-of-the-box, Java\u2122 Message Service (JMS) in a WebSphere Lombardi Edition cluster is configured for workload management, but not failover. It is possible to configure your cluster for both. More details on what these configurations entail is in the WebSphere Application Server V7 Messaging Administration Guide [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247770.pdf]. Specifically, see section 2.3.2 One bus, one bus member (a cluster), which is how a WebSphere Lombardi Edition cluster is configured, by default.\n\nANSWER\nAfter installing and configuring your cluster using the WebSphere Lombardi Edition 7.1 / 7.2 Cluster Configuration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21460358] document, you can complete the following steps to configure your messaging engines to failover from one node to another, in the event that a node goes down. These steps refer to the process server messaging engines, but the same configuration is possible for the performance data warehouses. \n\n 1.  Shut down all of your process servers and performance data warehouses.\n     \n     \n 2.  Log in to the WebSphere Administrative Console.\n     \n     \n 3.  Navigate to Buses > twprocsvr_bus > Bus Members.\n     \n     \n 4.  Select only the member, named \"twprocsvr_cluster\".\n     \n     \n 5.  Select the check boxes next to the two bus members, and click enable policy assistance.\n     \n     \n 6.  Select Scalability with high availability and click Next.\n     \n     \n 7.  Navigate to Buses > twprocsvr_bus > Bus members > twprocsvr_cluster > Messaging engine policy maintenance.\n     \n     \n     You should see two new policies that did not exist in step 4. \n     \n     \n 8.  Select these new policies one at a time and add node 2 to the list of preferred servers for the first policy and node 1 to the list of preferred servers for the second policy. Ensure the order of servers for the first policy is node 1 and then node 2. Ensure the order of servers for the second policy is node 2 and then node 1.\n     \n     \n 9.  Navigate to Buses > twprocsvr_bus > Bus members > twprocsvr_cluster > Redundant core group policies.\n     \n     You should see the original policies, named \"twprocsvr_node\" and \"twprocsvr2_node\", by default. \n 10. Select both of these original policies and click Delete. If these policies are not removed, they will conflict with the two newly created policies and your messaging engines will not start up correctly.\n     \n     \n     \n     Note: You can add any nodes to these policies depending on how you want to set up your cluster and backup nodes. You will notice that there is also a Failback option on the beginning page of each policy. This setting tells the member to migrate back to it's most preferred node should it come back online.\n     \n     \n 11. Start your servers and verify that the messaging engines start by navigating in the WebSphere Administrative Console to Buses > twprocsvr_bus > Messaging engines.\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n Lombardi WLE",
      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n While using OMEGAMON for Messaging, we found messages are not being processed from KQI.AGENT.REPLY QUEUE. Can you please explain the following 3 scenarios: \n\n1) Master Broker DEV\nLPar: 1234/5678\nIIB Agent: OMEGQI\nMQ Agent: OMEGMQ\nTotal IIB Brokers: 13 in each LPar\n\nOn Queue Manager (QMGR) QMG1 under Lpar 1234 there are no consumer on KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE \nQUEUE. Something is writing messages and has filled up the Q to 10,000 an now messages are spilling into the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). \n\nOn QMGR QMG2 under Lpar 1234- it looks good in MQ. Active consumer on KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE. \n\nOn QMGR QMGA under Lpar 5678 no consumer on Queue KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE with few messages on it. \n\nOn QMGR QMGB under Lpar 5678 no consumer on Queue KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE with few messages \non it.\n\nOn all these brokers, the Archive accounting statistics with output format XML, SMF and resource statistics are active. However, apart from QMG2BRK none of the other brokers are showing \"Broker status events, resource statistics and msgflow statistics\". \n\n2) Master Broker Prod\nLPar: LPA1/LPA2/LPAA/MBB2\nBroker tasks: QMP1BRK(LPA1)/QMP2BRK(LPA2)/QMPABRK(LPA1) / QMPBBRK(LPA2)\nNumber of brokers: 6/Lpar\n\nSimilar to above issue the KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE shows IPPROCS on QMPABRK(LPAA) and QMPBBRK(LPAB) but no consumer for this queue on QMP1BRK(LPA1) and QMP2BRK(LPA2). However, we suspect that QMP1BRK and QMP2BRK are not configured (updating KQIXML member) in the agent and is causing this issue but would like to confirm this. \n\n3) EPPLEX standalone\nLPar: LPOC and LPMB \nBroker: CBP1BRK and CBP2BRK\nNumber of brokers: 1/Lpar\n\nFollowing commands were issues successfully on both of these brokers:\n\nI) Enabling Archive Accounting statistic with xml,smf by customizing\nand submitting BIPCHMS.\nmqsichangeflowstats <brokername> -a -g -j -c active -n advanced -t\nbasic -o xml,smf\n\nII) Activate resource statistics by customizing and submitting BIPCHRS\nmqsichangeresourcestats <brokername> -c active\n\nThese brokers are activated with Archive accounting statistics but resource statistics are not showing up in OMEGAMON. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe analysis and solutions for each of the three scenarios are given below: \n\nScenario #1:\nThe issue is due to the number of threads available to the agent being too few for the number of brokers.\nThere are some error trace messages indicating \"Add a pending thread\" and other near messages indicate the threads would be the \"Qmgr receiver\", which is what opens and reads the agent reply queue on the broker's queue manager. So the parameter change maximumAgentCollectionThreads is required....\n\nSince you are monitoring more than 10 brokers in some IIB monitoring agents, you should add an agent parameter called maximumAgentCollectionThreads in the KQIXML member of &rhilev.RKANDATV. This parameter is not shipped in the base copy of KQIXML, so it needs to be added.\n\nThe default value is 64, which is enough for 10 brokers. Each additional broker over 10 requires you to add 6 to the value for each broker. So, for example, for 13 brokers being monitored, you should\nmake the value 82. There is not a problem with increasing this value on any agent, even if it is not monitoring so many brokers, so you can decide if 82 is appropriate for your site. \n\nIf you are modifying KQIXML in &rhilev.RKANDATV directly outside of PARMGEN, you would insert the parameter in the <KqiAGENT section of parameters, for example the environment below shows the parm\nmaximumAgentCollectionThreads being insered: \n\n<KqiAGENT version=\"730\"\nagentid=\"\"\ndefaultRetainBrokerEvents=\"10\"\ndefaultRetainFlowEvents=\"10\"\nretainProductEvents=\"10\"\ndiscoveryInterval=\"86400\"\ndefaultStatisticInterval=\"60\"\ndefaultFlowEventInterval=\"15\"\ndefaultHistoricalAccountingType=\"ARCHIVE\"\ndefaultRetainRecentSnapshotSamples=\"15\"\ndefaultRetainRecentArchiveSamples=\"5\"\ndefaultRetainRecentResourceSamples=\"1\"\nholdTimeForQuery=\"180\"\ndefaultReplyQueueName=\"KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE\"\ndefaultReplyQueueModel=\"SYSTEM.BROKER.MODEL.QUEUE\"\ndefaultCollectNodeData=\"NO\"\ndefaultTakeActionAuthUsers=\"*\"\nmaximumMessageLength=\"10240\"\ndefaultPersistentBrokerData=\"NO\"\ndefaultRefreshInterval=\"300\"\nmaximumAgentCollectionThreads=\"82\"\npersistentDataPath=\"/u/temp/data\"\nkqiUSSPath=\"/u/temp/kqi\">\n<MonitorBroker name=\"BRK\"\nalias=\"QMGRBRK\"\nenvfileDirectory=\"/wmqi/brokers/QMGRBRK\">\n</MonitorBroker>\n....\n</KqiAGENT>\n\nModify via PARMGEN, you should insert the parameter line in the\n<KqiAGENT section of parameters before the line \" |XIAGENT| \" in the\nKQIXML member of your related &hilev.TKANDATV dataset (note this is\nTKANDATV, not RKANDATV), as shown below in the line inserted for\nmaximumAgentCollectionThreads. After that, when job KCIJ%USP runs, it\nwill update the RKANDATV member with the new parameter, and the\nparameter will not disappear later out of RKANDATV when you re-run\nPARMGEN.\n\n<KqiAGENT version=\"730\"\nmaximumAgentCollectionThreads=\"82\"\n|XIAGENT|\ndefaultRetainBrokerEvents=\"|XIBERET|\"\ndefaultRetainFlowEvents=\"|XIFERET|\"\nretainProductEvents=\"|XIPERET|\"\ndiscoveryInterval=\"|XIDISINT|\"\ndefaultStatisticInterval=\"|XISTINT|\"\ndefaultFlowEventInterval=\"|XIFEINT|\"\ndefaultHistoricalAccountingType=\"|XIHACCTT|\"\ndefaultRetainRecentSnapshotSamples=\"|XISSRET|\"\ndefaultRetainRecentArchiveSamples=\"|XIASRET|\"\ndefaultRetainRecentResourceSamples=\"|XIRSRET|\"\nholdTimeForQuery=\"|XIHTQRY|\"\ndefaultReplyQueueName=\"|XIREQNME|\"\ndefaultReplyQueueModel=\"|XIREQMDL|\"\ndefaultCollectNodeData=\"|XICOLNDD|\"\ndefaultTakeActionAuthUsers=\"|XIDUSERS|\"\nmaximumMessageLength=\"|XIMAXML|\"\ndefaultPersistentBrokerData=\"|XIPERBKD|\"\ndefaultRefreshInterval=\"|XIREFINT|\"\npersistentDataPath=\"|XIPERDTP|\"\nkqiUSSPath=\"|XIUSSPAT|\">\n<MonitorBroker name=\"|XIMBNAME|\"\nalias=\"|XIMBALIA|\"\nenvfileDirectory=\"|XIMBDIR|\">\n</MonitorBroker>\n</KqiAGENT>\n\nThis is the documentation link to description of the parameter:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRLD6_7.3.0/kqi_userguide/r-kqiagent_maximumagentcollectionthreads.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRLD6_7.3.0/kqi_userguide/r-kqiagent_maximumagentcollectionthreads.html]\n\n\nScenario #2:\nConfirm that the brokers related to the KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE queues with 0 opens for input (no IPPROCS) are being monitored by the agent. When you update your agent parameters to add the required extra MonitorBroker section for each broker to be monitored, then queues will then be open for input by the agent as expected, and the IPPROCS value will become non-zero. So for this issue, you need to add statements like the following to your KQIXML for each broker to be monitored, and for PARMGEN, you would update your WCONFIG(KQI$XML) member as follows:\n\n<MonitorBroker name=\"CEP2BRK\"\nalias=\"CEP2BRK\"\nenvfileDirectory=\"/opt/local/lpp/mqsi/home/CEP2BRK\">\n</MonitorBroker>\n\n\nScenario #3:\nThe agents are getting a reason code of 2035 from the broker's queue manager when opening the agent's reply queue, which means it is not authorized for opening the KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE. This may be an authorization issue with the model queue being used to create the reply queue (SYSTEM.BROKER.MODEL.QUEUE), or it may be an authorization issue for the reply queue being created (KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE), so you have to check authorization for the agent's user ID for both. Please\nupdate the security specifications for the queue managers involved and restart the agent.\n\nThese are the agent log messages that indicate the problem:\n\nagent log #1:\n2017.309 05:09:41.48 KQIA044W (kqiaqopn.023) Open failed for queue KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE on queue manager CBP1, reason code 2035.\n2017.309 05:09:41.49 KQIA038W (kqiaqrcv.003) Required queue KQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE on CBP1 is failing to open with reason code 203\n2017.309 05:09:41.49 5; periodic open retry will occur.\n\nagent log #2:\n2017.309 05:10:47.00 KQIA044W (kqiaqopn.023) Open failed for queue\nKQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE on queue manager CBP2, reason code 2035.\n2017.309 05:10:47.00 KQIA038W (kqiaqrcv.003) Required queue\nKQI.AGENT.REPLY.QUEUE on CBP2 is failing to open with reason code 203\n2017.309 05:10:47.00 5; periodic open retry will occur.\n\nRegarding the error messages given below from the logs with the mqsireport commands, the broker was not running when the commands were issued, so it cannot respond. The mqsireportbroker command works when the broker is not running, but the mqisreportflowstats and mqsireportresourcestats commands do not work when the broker is not running. The log gives a BIP8019E message for each of the 2 mqsireportflowstats commands and a BIP1919S message for the mqsireportresourcestats command, which is all for the same reason.\n\nBIP8019E: Integration node 'CBP1BRK' stopped.\n\nThis integration node is stopped; the command you issued cannot be processed when an integration node is stopped. A previous command has been issued to stop this integration node, or this integration node has never been started. This integration node can be started, changed, or deleted.\n\nBIP1919S: The integration node 'CBP1BRK' cannot be reached. \n\nCheck that the integration node is running. The message was 'Failed to connect to the integration node. Return code: 0'.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging for z/OS IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for WebSphere Message Broker Monitoring on z/OS z/OS 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.1.0, 7.3.0",

Install IBM(R) Lotus(R) Domino(R) server on the first node, that is, domdev1; Each data directory needs to be in a shared disk. For example, F:\\data1, F:\\data2, and so forth. \n 2. Run Domino Setup for all partitioned servers on the first node.\n    Recommendation: Make sure to use Cluster IP addresses and associated DNS hostnames for Domino partitions; therefore, during the setup process, you need to select \"Customize\" and change the hostname to the cluster hostname. \n 3. Start the Domino servers to verify that they start as they should. Stop the Domino servers and all Domino processes using shared resources. \n 4. Install Domino on the second node, that is, domdev2, with two data directories locally on c:\\. \n 5. Update Domino services for each partitioned server and update each to use its respective data directory on F:\\ \n    a) as applications - no need to edit anything.\n    b) as services - change registry entries for Domino services to point to the data directory on the shared resource \"F:\". \n 6. From the Cluster Administrator, stop MSCS service on the first node, and then make sure active resources are taken over by the second node. \n 7. Start Domino servers on the second node (domdev2). \n 8. Verify that the second node is working correctly with data directories in F:\\\n\n\nSingle partition in MS Cluster  1. Install a Domino server on the first node with the single partition residing on F:. For example, F:\\data. \n 2. Set up a Domino server and rename the host to the cluster hostname that is specified in \"Customize\". \n 3. Install a Domino server on the second node. \n 4. Copy the file, notes.ini, to the program directory from the first node to the second node. For single partitioned servers, the file notes.ini is located in the program directory. \n 5. Edit the service registry keys to be exactly the same on both nodes. \n 6. Set the Domino service start type to manual for failover to work for Domino services.\n\n\nConfigure Domino server failover using MS clustering \nYou need to add Domino service(s) as a resource in an active cluster group. Domino does not have any specific resource designed for MS cluster; therefore, we use a generic service that MS cluster provides.  1. Select one active group such as Cluster group or Group 0. \n 2. Add \"New\" -> \"Resource\" to the group. \n 3. Select \"Generic Service\" in resource type. \n 4. Use the name \"Cluster Domino Service.\" \n 5. Add both Microsoft Windows servers to the cluster, and then be sure all other resources are available before Cluster Domino Service1 starts by adding all other resources as dependencies. \n 6. Verify that you are using a service name, not a display name. \n 7. Ensure Domino services on both Microsoft Windows servers have the same service name.\n\nNo registry replication is needed \n\n\n * \n *"

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM\nMatching: \n\nWhen performing a search in IBM Verse, the text you enter needs to be an exact match of the term for which you are looking. If you want to perform a search of a partial term or a fuzzy search of that term, you need to use a wildcard in your string. \n\nFor example, if you are looking to find all emails that contain the term 1234567, you cannot search for 1234. You can search for 1234*. \n\n\nWhen entering search terms into the search bar, users should be aware of the use of AND, OR and parenthesis to avoid misinterpreting the results. The default operand is AND. The AND and OR need to be upper case.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n * IBM Verse -> searches for messages that contain the term IBM and the term Verse in any order and do not need to be adjacent \n * \"IBM Verse\" -> searches for messages that contain the exact term IBM Verse. \n * IBM OR Verse -> searches for messages that contain the term IBM or the term Verse \n * [Person objectized name] book -> searches for messages from the person that contain the term book \n * [Folder objectized name] (book OR sport) -> searches for messages in the folder that contain the term book or the term sport \n * ( [person objectized name] OR [person objectized name] ) AND tools -> searches for messages from person1 or from person2 that contain the term tools\n\n\nUsing a Colon in Search \nCare needs to be taken when using the colon character (:) in a search. If a user searches for the terms: \n\nFirst: step one \n\nthe search can fail because the colon is a special character. In order to get the search to execute correctly, users can use quotes around their search term: \n\n\"First: step one\". \n\nSearching in Different Languages \nThe search component of IBM Verse handles all supported languages reasonably well, but does have some language specific limitations that we are working to address. This is not an exhaustive list, but covers many of the known issues. \n\nQuoting search terms \nIt may be necessary to put double quotes around search terms, so that they they only return an exact match. Search query terms are split into individual tokens or words, and documents will be returned with these words in any order. An English example. If a search is done on: \nJohn Smith \nThen documents that contain \"John\" and \"Smith\" will be returned, whether the words are in that order, or scattered throughout the document. If a search must only return the exact match \"John Smith\", then the query must be quoted \n\"John Smith\" \n\nIn Japanese and Korean, certain assumptions about word ordering may not be maintained by the search component, and it may be necessary to surround the search with double quotes, to ensure an exact match is returned. \n\nEquivalent characters \nThe Turkish characters i and \u0131 are equivalent and can be used interchangeably in text. When searching for the character i only documents containing that specific character will be returned. Documents containing the character \u0131 will not be returned, unless a search is done specifically for \u0131. \n\nHalf-width Katakana in Japanese \nSearching for combined half-width Katakana characters will fail to find documents containing those combined characters. \n\nSearching for Special Characters \nMost special characters are not supported when doing a search in IBM Verse. The characters will not produce an error, but will return All Documents. Special characters in any language may be affected by this limitation. \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nBe aware of these conditions when searching. \n\n \n\nAdditional documentation may be found here: How do I search more effectively with Verse?

      "dollar sign; slash; comma; period; ampersand; search; FTSearch; full text search; special characters; special symbols; lotusscript; Notes; Workstation/Desktop; Notes Client Functionality; Full Text Search TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\nHow does Notes treat symbols (such as @ & : /) in a Full Text query?\n\nANSWER\nNotes treats most symbols as white space. For example, there is no difference between the string \"$800\" and the string \"800.\" Both will be found whether or not the query includes the $ (dollar) sign.\nExceptions:\n\nA leading @ sign (located at the beginning of a word) is indexed. For example, to Notes, the word \"@command\" is different from the word \"command.\" You can search for these two words independently. A nested @ sign is also indexed, to allow for the searching of Internet addresses.\n\nNotes recognizes the following four symbols in a query if they are embedded within a word; however, Notes does not recognize them if they located are at the beginning or the end of a word:\n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThe words \"cc:mail\" and \"boot.bat,\" for example, are treated differently than \"cc mail\" and \"boot bat.\" In addition, note that the ampersand (&) is a reserved character; to search for a string such as \"AT&T,\" enclose the word in quotes (in the query). These four symbols are ignored by a query if they are located at the beginning or end of the word. You can search for any of these characters if they are contained within spaces. For example, you can search for \"AT & T\" or \"Mr / Mrs\". \n\nHyphens are one of the characters that is treated as white space (even if embedded within a word). In addition, the forward slash ( /) cannot be used in a query. The forward slash is often used in text as a delimiter between words such as \"our fly/drive plan\" and \"and/or.\"",

You do an Edit --> Find, type \"\\frog\" as the string to find, and receive a \" '[FF]rog' was not found\" message.\n\nExample 2: Your document contains the text, \"\\temp\". You do an Edit --> Find, type \"\\temp\" as the string to find, and receive a \" '[TAB]emp' was not found\" message.\n\nExample 3: Your document contains the text, \"\\nice\". You do an Edit --> Find, type \"\\nice\" as the string to find, and receive a \" '[NL]ice' was not found\" message.\n\nAll other characters preceded by backslash are treated as literals. For example, your document contains the text, \"\\apple\". You do an Edit --> Find, type \"\\apple\" as the string to find, and the search will find it. \n\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe backslash (\"\\\") in a search string is treated as a delimiter for specifying special characters: \n\n\n-- \\f or \\F matches the special ASCII character for Form Feed, which is how you can find form feeds in the document.\n\n-- \\n or \\N matches the special ASCII character for New Line, which is how you can find hard returns in the document.\n\n-- \\t or \\T matches the special ASCII character for tab, which is how you can find tabs in the document.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to search for the strings, \"\\f\", \"\\n\", and \"\\t\", double the backslash character (\"\\\\f\" or \"\\\\n\" or \"\\\\t\"). With this syntax, the first backslash serves as an escape character, indicating that the second backslash should be treated as the literal backslash character. \n\n\nWith any other characters, placing an extra backslash before a backslash has no effect. Searching for \"\\apple\" and \"\\\\apple\" performs the same search for the literal string, \"\\apple\". \n\nTherefore, using double backslash characters in searches is always safe and always obtains consistent results.\n\n\n\n\n * \n *"

[Root exception is org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextPackage.NotFound: IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext/NotFound:1.0]\n\n\nCAUSE\nAn incorrect la.providerURL was set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nWhen adding a new LDAP attribute to the security configuration in either a standalone or federated security environment, you must run the ConfigEngine tasks, wp-la-install-ear and then wp-add-property, with the following entries in the wkplc.properties file: \n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nIn a clustered environment, you should update the value for la.providerURL to point to the Deployment Manager's hostname and port number, instead of leaving it as the default value.

Only the Delete Attached Resources is visible.\n\nAs a result, the images are not undeployed from the cloud after the environment is deleted.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThis issue occurs when the Virtual System Pattern takes a long time to complete its deployment. It has been observed with certain complex patterns that contain 5 images.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou can search for messages of the following form to indicate the current time-out:\n\n\"Using Cloud Request Timeout=\"xxx\". Set this property using cloud.requestTimeout=\\\"<integer>\\\" in installed.properties, specified in seconds.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, note that no error is reported in the traces, even if you enabled cloud traces with the option: \n\n\ncloud.logLevel=DEBUG\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSOLUTION \n\n \n\n 1. Increase the timeout by updating the <Installation_dir>\\conf\\server\\installed.properties file and changing the value of the cloud.requestTimeout = [timeout in seconds] property\n    \n    \n 2. Restart the UrbanCode Deploy server",

No update is required for \"thin client\" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. \n\nOnce installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use \"Uninstall or change a program\" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. \n\nThe language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. \n\n \n\nAlerts! \n\n1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. \n\nThe global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\\RRS folder. The application copies are in the application DCO rules folder. \n\nCustomers must manually update the ruleset DLLs in each application where they are installed. \n\n2) When running an update, the master task configuration files are updated (Datacap\\ProgramSet) but the setting in applications are not updated (in application DCO folder). \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience problems that have been fixed. \n\nThe master task configuration is located in Datacap\\ProgramSet. The application settings are in the application DCO folder. \n\nCustomers must manually update the task setting in each application where they are installed. \n\n\nSystem requirements \n\nSelect the following link to see the hardware and software requirements for IBM Datacap. \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/softwareReqsForProduct.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/softwareReqsForProduct.html] \n\n\nSearch for \u2018Datacap\u2019, then select \"Datacap \" \n\nCheck the box \u2018Show feature packs\u2019 and select 9.0.1 for Feature Pack 1*. \n\nNew features added to IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 \n\nFor a list of new features that were added to Datacap 9.0.1 in Feature Pack 1, see:\nHighlights of IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm].\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.datacaptoc.doc/dc_highlights_9011.htm]\n\n\nNew Qualifications \n\n \n\nIBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 is qualified for use with: \n\n \n\n\u00b7 Microsoft Windows 10 (except for TMWeb Scanning with Twain drivers; \n\nSee \u201cKnown Limitations\u201d below for details) \n\n \n\n\u00b7 Oracle 12c (12.1.0.2.0) \n\n \n\n\u00b7 IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 FP7 \n\n \n\nIssues fixed in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 \n\n \n\nAPAR Number Summary IO23893 Clicking on QA link in tmweb - Administrator fails with error \"column named name already belongs to this datatable\" if using admin database on SQL server IO24025 Can not import file which name contains '0x905C' such as \"\u4fdd\u967a\u7533\u544aUpdated.tif\" IO24067 When customer use https + non-activeX to upload, some images will be corrupted frequently IO24082 Lineitem does not show up in Datacap Desktop Verify panel IO24102 Enhance IMail actions to use standard naming convention for ID's of pages created.

An explanation of the supported servers can be found in DataPower's Release Notes and currently states as follows: \n\nSSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) Support \nThe supported protocols are as follows: \n\n * SSH-2 protocol defined by IETF RFC 4251 \n * SFTP Version 3 defined by the draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt Internet-Draft \n\nIf an SFTP server supports Version 3 (the most commonly supported version), DataPower should be able to interoperate with it. \n\nEven if we interoperate with an SFTP server, we do not claim official support for it if we did not test it. Because we did not test with a wide variety of SFTP servers, we are not aware of any idiosyncrasies that a specific SFTP server may rely on which DataPower might not support. We simply support the SFTP v3 protocol according to the specification.",

No fixpack of runnign test are\n   needed.\n   \n   *** background of this problem ***\n   Customer suffered non-effectivenes of IDM WS 4.0.1 related\n   session timeout configuration after applying SP2 over the\n   Windows Serer 2003 (not R2). In the compatibility matrix of IDM\n   WS, it is not clearly stated that Windows Server 2003. It worked\n   out before applicaiton of SP2.\n   \n   This verision of IDM WS 4.0.1 is described as supported by\n   Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2. It is also confusing, that IDM DT\n   4.0.1 is described as supported by Windows Server 2003 SP2 (w/o\n   R2!). We need to clarify this, because this is just the boundary\n   of what the support can do for the customer. (see the Revision\n   Log of below and check the date 2007/5/12: it says, IDM DT & WS\n   4.0.1 HFP5 had certified for Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2, but not\n   written as \"... 2003 SP2\")\n   ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/cm/filenet/docs/wsopend\n   oc/40x/DT_WS_OC_CompatibilityMatrix.xls\n   \n   If Windows Server 2003 SP2 (w/o R2) is not a supported platform\n   for IDM WS 4.0.1, we may recommend to downgrade the server to\n   SP1. But if it is supported, we will have to check the session\n   configuration and see if it cannot be effective as the customer\n   stated in the PMR.\n   \n   \n   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :\n   Since the compatibility document information has written in the\n   excel sheet and shown onto the public.\n   As for the Since after their update from SP2 for Windows Server\n   2003\n   \n   \n   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :\n   n/a (probably only one server that runs IDM WS 4.0.1)\n   \n   \n   Is there a workaround? :\n   As for the compatibility matrix documentation, no workaround.\n   As for the problem they see, they said there exists some\n   workaorund, but not yet dislosed to us\n   \n   What is the impact to the customer/system? :\n   Just to clarify the compatibility matrix, so that it can let us\n   judge support customer or not (otherwise, this PMR is unsolved)\n   For the problem itself, dIfferent behavior than previous state\n   (before applying SP2), so the user session do not expires as\n   specified time, difficult to manage user logon behavior that was\n   possible before\n   \n   \n   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N -->\n   Y\n   By Who (L3, Support, etc..): anyone can see this uncertainty in\n   the compatibility matrix on the Web\n   \n   \n   Steps to Reproduce:\n   1 Check the \"4.0.1\" tab of this excel sheet and check if the IDM\n   WS is supported on the Windows Server 2003 SP2 (i.e. w/o R2)\n   2\n   3\n   \n   Actual Results:\n   No description for Revision Log 2007/5/12, only written as \"...\n   2003 R2 SP2\"\n   One can also see IDM DT 4.0.1 is suppoted by Windows Server 2003\n   SP2\n   You may conclude, uncertainty exists in the description of\n   Windows Server 2003 w/ or w/o R2 for SP2\n   L2 cannot respond to the customer's query clearly.\n   \n   Expected Results:\n   One shoudl have to clarify the compatibility information\n   regarding to the Windows Server 2003 w/ or w/o R2 (for SP2).\n   Because, w/ and w/o R2 is actually a different version of\n   Windows Server 2003 (w/o R2 cannot upgrade to w/ R2 by applying\n   any FPs).\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   Are there any similar or related Defects?

As an attempt to provide the best support possible for our customers, IBM will support IE 11 with Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Suite 8.5, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2.0, 9.2.1 and 9.3.0 in \"Compatibility mode\" only.\n\n\nIBM's support of compatibility mode for IE 11 is under the assumption that this setting provides complete backwards compatibility from Microsoft. For example, we assume that IE11 in IE8 compatibility mode functions the same as the official IE 8 browser version. If there is a difference found during problem analysis that points to a difference in the way the browser functions in compatibility mode, IBM reserves the right to request that Microsoft Support team be involved to fix the compatibility issue.\nIE 11 is supported only for Sterling Application console screens NOT for Commerce Call Center and Store Web applications.\n\nPlease Note: Customers are urged to complete end to end testing involving all UI components before rolling IE11 Compatibility Mode usage into production.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Commerce Sterling Order Management 9.3 Commerce Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Suite AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 9.2.1, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0, 8.5",

      "MQ WMQ v7.0 v7 v700 700 7 7.0 version TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Is WebSphere MQ Series v7.0 supported on WebSphere Partner Gateway v6.2? \n\nANSWER\nWhile IBM has not officially tested nor supports WPG 6.2 with the use of WMQ version 7.0, we do understand the need and reasons for such. IBM WPG support is planning this testing, however we do not have an estimated time when it will be complete or when the official statement will be released. \n\n\nSince other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible by the IBM WPG support team. While IBM support understands that client may have a need to upgrade, you may install and run with updates to supported product minimum levels, but only if those updates are forward compatible (meaning that they are above the minimum requirements defined by WPG). Users should note that they are running at their own risk if they are using a fix, update, or new release other then what is claimed by IBM WPG Support. If an issue was found IBM WPG support will provide best effort in determining and resolving the issue. The client should complete thorough testing before deploying such changes, and have a back out plan in case of serious incident.\n\nAs of WPG 6.2.1, WPG officially supports WMQ 7.0.1.3"

This can also be done using REST administration calls, as documented in IBM Knowledge Center. From the web administrative console, select Appliance > Security, and enable cross-site request forgery protection. \n\nNote: When cross-site request forgery protection is enabled, programs that make REST access to grid data or administrative operations must include HTTP basic authentication credentials with each request.

      "saiom sa iom ewas uninstall embedded websphere application servier fp9 fp0009 alert notification feature TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to uninstall SA IOM and force installation of the embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) 6.1.0.29 on unsupported Win7/Vista/2008 x64 environments. \n\nCAUSE\nFP9 includes a new version of eWAS, but the FP installer doesn't force eWAS update. Only customers, who don't have RpWeb component on a system, will get new eWAS installed. Therefore you should remove the entire RpWeb component in order to get the new eWAS version. Unfortunately the RpWeb installed from GA cannot be uninstalled correctly, so a full SA IOM uninstall and manual cleanup may be required.\n\nANSWER\nHow to uninstall SA IOM and force installation of the embedded WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1.0.29 \n\nNOTE: The following description is applicable to *unsupported* Windows 7/Vista/2008 x64 environments only, It was just a workaround for a clients Test environments where we knew they attempted to get SA IOM running on Windows 7 x64. This is \"for test only\" and affects currently *unsupported* Windows 7/2008 x64 environments. It is NOT required to update eWAS on supported XP/2003/2008 x32 systems.\n\n\n1. Stop all SA IOM processes: \n\n- autoexnt windows service\n- RpServer\n- RpClient\n- Embedded WAS\n- Derby\n\n2. Save configuration files \nRequired if some definitions were done using existing version of the product:\n- <...>\\SA IOM\\config\\*.*\n\nDepends on UAC and usage of the RpDatLoc.exe utility, the location of the directory could be different:\n- Installation directory, usually C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\SA IOM\\config\n- Users AppData, usually C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\IBM\\SA IOM\\config\n- All users AppData, usually C:\\Users\\All Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\IBM\\SA IOM\\config\n\nUse Windows Search on drive c:\\ for \"rpserver.dat\" to see which of the described directories contains the latest version of the file( it will be available in several other directories - because Windows performs internal linking of the files ).\n\n3. Save DBNOTIFY \nOnly if DBNOTIFY contains some data (alerting related definitions done via RpWeb GUI).\n- - <...>\\SA IOM\\derby\\DBNOTIFY\\*.*\n\nNot needed if you have no working RpWeb application now.\n\nDepends on UAC, the location of the directory could be different: - \n- Installation directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\SA IOM\\derby\\DBNOTIFY\n- Users virtual store directory C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\SA IOM\\derby\\DBNOTIFY\n\nUse Windows Search on drive c:\\ for \"DBNOTIFY\" to see which of the described directories contains the latest version of the DBNOTIFY database(again, it will be available in several other directories - because Windows performs internal linking of the files, but we should take one from described directories).\n\n4. Uninstall SA IOM \nWindows \"Control Panel\" -> \"Programs and Features\".\n\n5. Uninstall DB2 Run-Time Client Lite \nWindows \"Control Panel\" -> \"Programs and Features\".\n\n\n6. Delete SA IOM Services \n\nIf any still be available after uninstall.\n\n\n * from CMD.EXE ( Run As Administrator ):\n\n\nsc query Rp3270 \nsc query Autoexnt \nsc query RP_Primary \n\nsc stop Rp3270 \nsc stop Autoexnt \nsc stop RP_Primary \n\nsc delete Rp3270 \nsc delete Autoexnt \nsc delete RP_Primary \n7. Perform additional manual cleanup \n\n * all directories containing \"SA IOM\" in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM (or other installation location) \n * all directories containing \"SA IOM\" in C:\\Users\\*** (using search)\n\n8. Registry cleanup \n\n \n\n * All keys\\groups containg SA IOM:  * HKCU\\Software\\IBM\\SA IOM\\* \n    * HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\IBM\\SA IOM\\* \n    * HKKM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\IBM\\SA IOM\\* \n    * HK_USERS\\*\\Software\\IBM\\SA IOM\n   \n   \n * All keys\\groups containing Rp3270\n\n8. Set UAC to desired level\n\n\n9. RESTART SYSTEM \n\nLogon with a userid which will be used to manage SA IOM applications\n\n\n10. Install GA SA IOM 2.1 \n\n * only RpServer component should be installed. Do not select run as a service - not yet supported on W7x64 \n * RpClient could be installed from GA \n * DO NOT install RpWeb and Derby\n\n11. Install FP9 \n\n Select FULL INSTALL\n\n\n12. Move Config files to AppData \n\nUse RpDatLoc.exe (from SA IOM\\Utils) to copy configurations files to desired location.\n\n\n13. Stop all SA IOM processes \n\nDetails -see step 1.\n\n14. Restore saved data \nDetails - reverse step 2&3.\n\n\n15. Restart system \n\nStart all required components (Derby and RpWeb should already be started by Autoexnt service).\n\n\n== The system is available and fully operational\n\n\nNotes/Known Problems with Alerting: \n\n\n=> RpServer can't be used as a service.\n=> RpServer log may show errors like:\n\n\"E 3860 [ CCommTcpipListenThread::InitInstance ] TCPIP listening device open failed. nLastError: 10013\" \n\nfor several sockets. We are investigating this error. Currently the customer may attempt to stop RpServer, wait for 3-10 sec. and then start it again. It solves the problem.\n\n\n\nNote: => as of SA IOM V2.1.2, WAS and Derby is no longer used for Alert Notification, it is now handled internally.",
      "lste_webcast; Open Mic; Traveler; Lotus Notes Traveler; Android; iPad; Q&A; FAQ; Questions; Answers WEBCAST\n\nABSTRACT\n Presentation and Q & A session for Open Mic: \"Lotus Traveler (for Android & iPad) - Install, Configure & Admin\", March 10, 2011 \n\nCONTENT\nIn this Open Mic session, the presenter walked through a 45 minute presentation on \"Lotus Traveler (for Android & iPad) - Install, Configure & Admin\" followed by a Question & Answer session.\n\n\nQuestions and Answers from the Open Mic call: \n\n\nQ: What happens in wipe out ? What all data gets wiped out ?\n\nA: While selecting \"Wipe Device\" action for a particular user in LotusTraveler.nsf database, it will ask you about, which data to wipe ? The options are \"Lotus Traveler and Application\" and \"Storage card\". Depending upon your choice, it will wipe the data on device. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: How to identify which profile is active if user has configured 2 devices ?\nA: You can check LotusTraveler.nsf database and find out, which is recently connected device. If any particular device is not connected for a long time, then user may not be using it now. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can Traveler be configured on multiple devices for same user ?\nA: Yes, for the same user, Traveler can be configured on multiple devices like Nokia, Windows Mobile, Apple iPhone/iPad, Android etc. They will not make any conflict with each other because Traveler keeps a note of device id along with user name.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Whether enabling Anonymous access is security threat ?\nA: By default, Anonymous access is always allowed for HTTP/HTTPS in Domino server. It is the recommended setting and hence by default it is kept as \"Yes\" (allowed). It is not a security threat. When anonymous access is allowed, it doesn't mean that, everybody will be able to access your databases like names.nsf or mail file because the database ACL is still honored and anonymous access is set to \"No Access\" by default for names.nsf and other mail files.\nIf you have any other database which you want to prevent from anonymous access, then you must ensure its ACL which will be normally set to \"No Access\" for anonymous. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can traveler be configured to look-up to multiple directory ?\nA: Traveler server can be configured to look-up multiple directories using directory assistance/LDAP. Please check the following article on Lotus Traveler Wiki about corporate lookup.\nhttp://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_corporate_look_up_for_devices_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_corporate_look_up_for_devices_LNT8521]\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: We have upgraded Traveler server to 8.5.2 FP1, however unable to configure Traveler on Android ?\nA: Check if your other devices like Nokia, WM, Apple iPhone etc. work properly ? If they work properly, then can you open the home page of the Traveler server from that Android device ? e.g.- go to http://<FQHN>/servlet/traveler \nIf you cannot open the home page, then its a device level connection problem. If you can open the home page, then, are you not able to download the installer for Android OS ? If you are unable to download the installer, then check if you are using SSL. If yes, then there is a known issue which is described at this link. \nhttps://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457494 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457494]\nTry copying the installer of Android directly to device memory card via PC, and try to configure. The installer can be found in server at \"data\\domino\\html\\traveler\\LotusTraveler\\Android\\LotusTraveler.apk\" path. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Sometimes we are unable to sync with traveler with error on server console.\nA: Whether this problem happens only in peak hours like only between 10.00 AM to 6.00 PM ? If yes, then try in the morning/night time when there is less load on the server ? If you are able to sync properly when there is less load, then most probably it is the performance issue related with HTTP threads. HTTP threads can be increased using a parameter \"NTS_MAX_HTTP_THREADS=xxxx\". The default value is 100. For more please refer : http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521]\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: When I shut down the Traveler server for an hour, whether the mails arrived during that one hour are lost ?\nA: No, the mails will not be lost because Traveler server keeps the last sync information. When connected with the device, it will consider the last sync time and will sync the mails accordingly. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Is there any limitation on number of devices in the licences ?\nA: Kindly check with the IBM sales team for latest information about licenses as this information can change over time. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What is bandwidth requirement for Traveler ?\nA: There is no hard and fast bandwidth requirement for Traveler but faster connection is always better. We recommend doing at least the initial sync with high speed connection like WiFi/3G if possible. Next synchronization can happen over normal GPRS. Even initial sync can happen with normal GPRS but it will be somewhat slow. You can reduce the number of days to sync the mails for faster synchronization.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What is limit to number of users on the Traveler server.\nA: There is no such defined limit for the number of users. However if the number of users are too large like 400-500, then consider increasing the HTTP threads using parameter \"NTS_MAX_HTTP_THREADS=xxxx\" to avoid performance problem [Please refer the link :http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521]]. If you still face performance problem after increasing the HTTP threads, then you may need to use the 64 bit version or setup another Traveler server in your environment to divide the load. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: When are we expecting clustering feature on Traveler server ?\nA: This feature is being considered and development team is working on the same. However at this time, we can't say in which release it will be introduced. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: How to update Lotus Traveler automatically ?\nA: Lotus Mobile Installer [LMI] is installed on your device which checks for available updates for the software . User will be prompted for latest updates available and can install it if required. User can also manually check for updates in Lotus Mobile Installer.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Procedure to manually upgrade the client ?\nA: In order to manually upgrade the client just download the latest installer file from server or copy it to your device memory card from PC and run it. \nThere is no need to uninstall the previous version. It will be automatically upgraded to latest version. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Unable to sync even after upgrading on normal GPRS ?\nA: This problem normally happens if you have just upgraded your Traveler server but not the client. Confirm the client version by going to About dialog box in Traveler menu. If you are running HTTP/HTTPS on some other ports (other than 80 or 443) then some service providers may not allow other ports to access in normal GPRS. They only allow port 80 and 443 in normal GPRS. Also make sure that, you have selected a correct Auto sync protocol as HTTP or HTTPS. Try reinstalling the client and also try in other devices. It cannot happen in all the devices if you are using standard ports. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Will data directory of 32-bit work on 64-bit ?\nA: Yes, it will work. As long as you have the backup of data directory, you can move your Traveler server to a new hardware.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: If I don't use command to delete user on Traveler server then what will happen ?\nA: If we do not use command but directly delete user's document from Lotustraveler.nsf database then the user is not actually deleted from server as such. Lotustraveler.nsf database is an interface to Traveler server's internal storage. Hence in order to delete a user it is recommended to run the command as \"Tell Traveler delete * Firstname Lastname\"\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: I am unable to see android install option ?\nA: Even after upgrade to the latest Traveler 8.5.2 Fixpack1 [8.5.2.1] , users unable to see option to download client for Android. This may be caused due to improper upgrade or some required files not being installed while upgrading the server. In order to correct the problem , please rerun the installer for 8.5.2.1 . \nIf you have installed Traveler as 2 step process i.e. first install Traveler 8.5.2 and then upgraded to fixpack 1 of traveler then just re-running the fixpack installer will do. If you have run the composite installer for 8.5.2.1 then you will have to run the same again to correct the issue.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Does upgrading the Domino with FP1 works ?\nA: Upgrading of Domino to FP1 is not mandatory in order to work with Traveler 8.5.2 FP1. Traveler 8.5.1 FP1 can be installed on Domino 8.5.2 onwards with any fixpack levels of Domino. However it is always better to install the latest Domino fixpack.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: I am unable to download traveler installer to a specific device ?\nA: In such instance it is required to narrow down the issue, if it is device or user specific . We may need to test on different device and also on different user account on this specific device. Once the issue is narrowed down we can proceed to collect additional logs based on the outcome.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: We have configured HTTP to listen on port 85, able to connect Android device or iPhone however unable to connect the Windows mobile ? \nA: Make sure that, you have selected the correct port number for HTTP in the client settings. Try in different Windows mobile device if possible. If server and client port numbers match, then there is no reason why it will not work with WM device. Also try inserting another working sim card in the same mobile device and check if it works properly ? If you are using basic GPRS connection, then some service providers may allow only port 80 and 443 and in that case, other ports may not work. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: In Traveler, whether the address name lookup works?\nA: Yes, it works in Traveler. Please use at least Traveler 8.5.2.1 version for name lookup feature on all devices like Apple, Nokia, WM and Android.\nPlease go through the following link for more information about corporate lookup. \nhttp://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_corporate_look_up_for_devices_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_corporate_look_up_for_devices_LNT8521]\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we open MS Office attachments in mails using Lotus Traveler ? \nA: Yes you can if you have the reader on your device for the same. Traveler does not restrict any specific attachment but the attachment can not be opened on that device, if that device doesn't have the reader for that type of attachments.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What are the ports required by Traveler server ?\nA: Starting from Traveler 8.5.2 HTTP and HTTPS ports are required [80/443] . Previous version of Traveler (8.5.1) also requires port 8642 for auto sync in addition to 80 and 443. \nPlease note - If any of the client version is prior to 8.5.2 then 8642 port is required for auto sync.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we run Traveler & webmail together on the same Domino instance? \nA: Yes , you can run Traveler & webmail together on the same Domino instance. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What should be the count of the http active threads in the server document for 2000 traveler users?\nA: For such high number of users, we highly recommend using 64 bit version. \nGive command \"Tell Traveler status\" to know the overall Traveler status of Traveler server which will give you idea about, if you want to increase the HTTP threads. Give these commands on the server console to know the HTTP threads value. \n\nshow stat http.workers\nshow stat http.peakConnections\nshow stat http.CurrentConnections\n\nIf the CurrentConnections/PeakConnections are greater than 80% of HTTP Workers, then this may need attention, especially if the value is over 90% then you may need to increase HTTP threads. This you may need to check from time to time when your server is fully loaded to determine if you really need to increase the number of HTTP threads using \"NTS_MAX_HTTP_THREADS=xxxx\". Please go through the following link for more information about performance tuning of Traveler server. \n\nhttp://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521]\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Where and how can I look for the ILNT.Mobile file in iphone? \nA: From a PC open \"http://<hostname>/servlet/traveler\" page of the server. Login with user name and select the option \"Generate Apple Profile\". It will save the file \"ILNT.mobileconfig\" on your PC. From Apple iPhone, you can't view this file directly, \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we use load balancer above two traveler servers ? \nA: You cannot use load balancer with Traveler server because the device is registered with specific Traveler server. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: The Traveler Policy is not assigned to the device even I had assigned it ? \nA: By default the traveler policies are updated every six hours. If you want to update the policies immediately then you need to \nissue the commands \"Tell adminp process traveler\" and \"Tell Traveler policy update user name/org\" \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we restrict traveler users to download attachment to their device. \nA: Yes you can restrict traveler users to download using Traveler Policy settings.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Why Auto-sync has been omitted in the policy options in 8.5.2 ? \nA: Starting from Traveler 8.5.2, Auto sync works on the same port as that of HTTP/HTTPS if Traveler client is 8.5.2. \nNote:- If Traveler client is is lower than 8.5.2, then you can still use this option in policy but it is obsolete for 8.5.2 \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we use a group for policy assignment on Lotus Traveler instead of specific user name? \nA: Yes you can use group for policy assignment on Lotus Traveler instead of specifying user name. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What are the important databases which we need to consider for daily backup ?\nA: You should take the backup of whole data directory for Traveler server backup. There are no specific databases or files to take backup. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Do we have any method to restrict specific type of device from installing Lotus Traveler client ? \nA: Yes , it can be done by altering the NTSCinfig.xml file \n\nALLOWED_USER_AGENT_REGEX VALUE= in NTSConfig.xml (data\\traveler\\cfg)\n\n- The default value is \".*\", which allows all devices to sync\n- \"(IBM SyncML Client)|(Lotus Traveler WM)\" - Allows only Windows Mobile devices to sync\n- \u201c(Nokia SyncML HTTP Client)|(Lotus Traveler Nokia)\u201d \u2013 Allows only Nokia Mobile devices \nto sync\n- \"Lotus Traveler .* 8.5.2\u201c Allows only Windows and Nokia and Mobile devices to sync\n- \"Apple\" Allows only Apple Mobile devices to sync.\n- \"(Apple)|(Lotus Traveler WM)\u201c Allows only Apple and Windows Mobile devices to sync\n- \"Apple-iPhone/7\u201c Allows only Apple iPhones (not iPods or iPads) to sync\n- \"Lotus Traveler Android\" - Only Android devices are allowed to sync.\n\nRefer article for more details - http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Restricting_access_by_device_category_LNT8521 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Restricting_access_by_device_category_LNT8521]\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we use traveler in Blackberry handheld ?\nA: No, Traveler can not be used with Blackberry devices as of now.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can single user use traveler in multiple devices simultaneously ? \nA: Yes, single user can use traveler on multiple devices at the same time. Traveler will sync based upon device id and user name.\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What is the difference between Device Settings in LotusTraveler.nsf db compared to Traveler policy? Which will take precedence if I had \nboth set and assign to user but different settings? \nA: No difference as such . Same information is populated at both places \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: What could be the cause for lotus traveler to stop working on iPhones where the emails no longer get synchronized and we have to delete the account and recreate it. \nA: This seems to be an issue with your environment and we need to check the Traveler logs to understand it. We especially need to check, what is the error received on device ? What is the error shown on server console at that time ? Is device attempting to connect to server and if yes, why the device request could not be served from Traveler server ? This we can find in Traveler logs. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Is it possible for the traveler client installed on the iPad, to ask for the password authentication OR When a user alters their internet password, is there a way by which the device password can be updated or the user would receive a system generated message asking them to update the password on the device ? \nA: If the there is change in the internet password user has to manually change it on the device. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Which JVM version supported for Lotus Traveler ? \nA: There is no specific requirement of JVM for a Traveler server and client. It will work irrespective of JVM version. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we lock the Lotus Traveler Client in the device? \nA: You can lock the device with password. You can use the security policy to force the password on device as well. However there is no feature to lock the Traveler client. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Do we need to set values for TSS_PRIMESYNC_THREADS, TSS_SYNC_THREADS and WORKER_THREADS in Windows 2003 - 64 bit? \nA: If you are having any performance issue, then support can suggest you the required values based upon existing performance. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: How do we upgrade the Lotus Traveler Client in the devices ? Do we need to reinstall the client ? \nA: Traveler client be upgraded via Lotus Mobile installer, which is an additional application which gets installed on device and it can check for updates and prompt the user. User simply need to run the setup of new version. It will upgrade the existing client. There is no need to uninstall the previous client on the device. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Whether switching between different data networks WiFi, 3G and others will lead to performance problems in the Lotus Traveler mail sync? \nA: If the connection is slow, then there will be some performance issue for client, But normally when only 1 or 2 mails are getting sync, then user will not face any performance problem. Initial sync is recommended via high speed connection if possible, \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: How can we use local intranet web application to lotus traveler enabled device ?\nA: If the Notes application is designed for the mobile device you should be able to access through the device browser and for that you \ndon't require the traveler client to access it. However the main purpose of Traveler is to push mails to device. It is not intended for using intranet web applications. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Embedded images in the mails are not seen in certain devices where Lotus Traveler is configured? A: Probably there is some device level issue We would need to investigate the issue and would need additional information and logs. \n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nQ: Can we setup the reverse proxy server setting in Lotus traveler server ?\nA: Yes you can have the reverse proxy server in the environment to access the traveler server. You need to specify the External server URL field in the server document > Lotus Traveler tab with the hostname of reverse proxy server. e.g.- \"http://<hostname>/servlet/traveler\"\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Traveler APAR Listing: [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Lotus_Notes_Traveler_APAR_listing#852nlv1]\nTraveler Recommended Maintenance: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24019529]\nTraveler Wiki-based InfoCenter: [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=Lotus Notes Traveler8.5.2 Documentation]\nPrevious Open Mic conducted on 14 Oct 2010 presentation [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21451611]\nPerformance tuning of the Traveler server: [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tuning_performance_of_the_server_LNT8521]\n\n\nLotus Traveler Open Mic 10 March 2011.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021479&aid=2]Lotus Traveler Open Mic 10 March 2011.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021479&aid=1] \n\nLotus Traveler Open Mic 10 March 2011.pdf"

Can it be directed to a shared (NFS) space? 17:40 What is the difference between WAS installation through IM and Silent mode installation? 19:21 How to import license from RAD 7.0 to 8.5.5 (trial version)? 19:51 Can you please give an overview of using IM to install ifix? 20:38 I have WAS ND 8.5.5 32-bit installed on a 32-bit linux server, and I have a new linux 64bit server that we want only the 64bit 8.5.5 WAS, and use the DMGR on the 32-bit server, how do we do this? 22:14 Why is IBM only providing Installation of WebSphere Application Server through Installation Mananger? 23:01 When we go for Ifix and when we go for fixpack, what is basic difference between those? 23:50 Can you pleasee give information about what is the use of Liberty profile and its advantages? 24:57 What do you recommend if there is a need to duplicate the WebSphere environment? 26:54 What are the basic pre-req checks for installation of Installation Manager? 28:19 Do you have a link for how to federate the 64-bit WAS ND APPSERVER to 32-bit DMGR, instructions/step (jython scripting) so it can be automated? 29:20 With WebSphere products changing the method of installation, is there a white paper, or recommended practices, for setting up a central repository? 30:33 Is there any way make a WAS back-up through Installation Manager? 30:52 Do we have to uninstall previous ifix before installing latest fix pack? 32:09 We are planning to migrate from WAS 6.1 to WAS8.5.5, can I install 8.5.5 on top of the existing 6.1 profile? Or does it have to be a fresh installation? 33:10 I have an NFS share on 3 servers and IIM is installed there. Can I utilize IIM to install/uninstall with 2 different users without any issues on all 3 servers? 34:44 Is there a document for migrating WebSphere 7 to WAS 8.7 entire cell, say node-by-node? 35:11 What provisions does WebSphere Application Server provide to prevent denial of service attacks? 35:40 If we have 32-bit 8.5.5 DMGR and 1 APPSRVR 32-bit 8.5.5 and a 2nd APPSRVR 64-bit 8.5.5, does the DMGR have to be updated first or can we update the APPServers first? That is, does the order matter for fixes? 36:58 Is it a good idea to create any dependency on the dmgr for runtime? For example, Adobe Life Cycle installed on top of WAS uses some cache mechanism called gds, gemfire, etc. 37:42 I noticed on IM with 8.5 that when you choose to install the updates, it always goes through your IBM PA account to get the updates and the latest. But with Maximo application for instance, you only want to go to 8.5.0.1 for instance, so the only way I found is run the update pointing to the repository for fix 1, and choose update and keep clicking cancel to look online to continue and install the fix 1. Is this the only way to install a fix on V8 or V8.5? 39:40 When migrating WAS from 6.1 to 8.5, do you guys recommend using the migration tool or create configurations using scripts? 40:44 To upgrade websphere from 6.1 to 8.5, What path do you suggest: fresh install or migration proces?. If you suggest migration process where can I get the documentation? 42:34 To get to WAS 8.0 from WAS 8.1, is this a migration process only? 42:57 What is the latest fix pack available on top of 8.5.5.0 base (and location to down load from Passport Advantage)? 43:37 Is there a fixed release scheduled for FixPacks? I hear that it's every 3 months or so. 44:24 If I have 1000 servers to apply FP, whats the recommended method to apply fixes to large number of servers in minimum time; any tools available? 47:01 I have IIM, WASND, WAS installed and configured per application's requirement. Now, I want to install another instance of WAS. Does IIM have an option to take the existing WAS as a template so that I can get the configuration also? 47:49 We are planning to upgrade from 6.1 to 8.5.5.0.

      "\"-bash: ./install: cannot execute binary file\"; \"bad elf interpreter\"; \"Cannot execute binary file\" TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n IBM Installation Manager cannot be installed or started on a RHEL 6.0/6.1 x86_64 (64-bit) machine. \n\nSYMPTOM\nIn a shell window, you run the command ./install in a directory that contains the installation files for Installation Manager. You receive the output:\n\n\n[root@zahar-rhel64 IMinstallKit]# ./install\nbash: ./install: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nYou might also receive an output such as:\n\n[root@c01bmp02 IM]# ./install\nJVMJ9VM011W Unable to load j9dmp24: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nJVMJ9VM011W Unable to load j9jit24: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nJVMJ9VM011W Unable to load j9gc24: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nJVMJ9VM011W Unable to load j9vrb24: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n\nCAUSE\nInstallation Manager is a 32-bit application and requires 32-bit versions of OS system libraries. These libraries are not installed on RHEL 6.0/6.1 x86_64 (64-bit) by default. You must install these 32-bit libraries on your system before you run Installation Manager.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe required libraries are available on the Red Hat 6.0/6.1 distribution DVD. To install the required libraries: \n\n\n1. Mount the DVD to the system. Insert the DVD into the DVD drive. \n\n2. Select open a terminal window as a root.\n\n3. Execute the commands: \n\n[root@localhost]# mkdir /mnt/cdrom\n[root@localhost]# mount -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom\n\n4. Create the text file server.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory. \n\nNote: To use gedit, execute the command:\n[root@localhost]# gedit /etc/yum.repos.d/server.repo\n\nAdd the following text to the file: \n\n[server]\nname=server\nbaseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/Workstation\nenabled=1\n\nwhere baseurl depends on the mounting point and the RHEL distribution. \n\nIn the example, the mounting point is cdrom and the RHEL distribution is Workstation but could be sever.\n\n5. Execute the command:\n\n[root@localhost]# yum clean all\n\n6. Execute the command to import related public keys:\n\n[root@localhost]# rpm --import /mnt/cdrom/*GPG*\n\n7. Execute the commands to install the required libraries:\n\n[root@localhost]# yum install gtk2.i686\n[root@localhost]# yum install libXtst.i686\n\nIf you received the missing libstdc++ message above, install the libstdc++ library:\n\n[root@localhost]# yum install compat-libstdc++\n\nDuring the install you might receive prompts similar to the example. Answer with 'y'.\n\nExample:\nTotal download size: 15 M\nInstalled size: 47 M\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\nNote: The package name extension (.i686) might change in the command depending on the hardware platform that you use.

      "Webgui Installation fails 32-bit 64-bit package group TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Installation of WebSphere/WEBGUI fails during the installation of WebSphere with below error on zLinux:\n\nThe 32-bit IBM WebSphere Application Server package cannot be installed in a 64-bit package group. \n\nSYMPTOM\nYou will get below errors if you try to install 64-bit version of WebSphere on z-linux server, using 64-bit IBM Installation Manager. \n\nThe 32-bit IBM WebSphere Application Server package cannot be installed in a 64-bit package group.\n\nIf you try to install Netcool WEBGUI on the same machine it requires 64-bit Installation Manager. If you try 32-bit IM the installation will fail with below errors:\n\nERROR: The 64-bit IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI package cannot be installed in a 32-bit package group. \n\nErr - Failure in installing WebGUI 8.1 ... Check Installation Manager logs.\n\n\nCAUSE\nWebsphere 8.5 offerings do not support a 64-bit package group on zLinux in IBM Installation Manager (IM) even if you try to install 64-bit version of WebSphere. \n\nAn internal APAR PI61710 is created for this. It is scheduled in WebSphere 8.5 Fix Pack 10. \nEstimated release date for 8.5.5.10 can be found in below technote:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004980 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004980]\n\nThe root problem is that WAS does not properly respect 's390x' (nor apparently 'ppc64') in the IM response file so you need to use arch='s390' to suppress above errors.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo complete the installation use below work around. Using this work around you can complete the installation using same response file and 64-bit Installation Manager. \n\n1. In the response file set arch='s390' for WAS only. The fix (setting arch='s390') applies to WebSphere's three components (Base, SDK, & JazzSM extensions) only. Make this change in the profile section of the response file. \n\nFollowing shows a line in response file which represents architecture.\n<data key='cic.selector.arch' value='s390'/> \n\n2. For all other components (JazzSM/DASH,WebGUI, and OMNIbus Core) use 's390x', which is what it correctly should be if it is 64-bit zLinux on s390x (and 'ppc64'). \n\n3. After above change try the installation.",

This causes the JRE folder to not be uninstalled during an uninstall operation. Other UNIX and Linux operating systems have similar issues. \n\nOnly install the Installation Manager on a local disk."

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n You have configured a WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factory without an Authentication Alias and do not programmatically supply user identifier information when creating a connection to a queue manager. You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:\n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. \n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. \n\nIn the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:\n\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') \n\nIs this change in behaviour expected? \n\nANSWER\nWebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(\u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d);\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);\n\nIn the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.\n\nAs a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.\n\nThis change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.\n\nIn the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.\n\n\nIn summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.\n\n- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.\n\n\nThe com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property\n\nA Java System Property called \u201ccom.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID\u201d was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.\n\nThe changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.\n\nThis property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.\n\nOther Useful Resources\n\nWebSphere MQ Documentation\n\nThe WebSphere MQ Documentation contains a section on planning user authorization which also includes a description on access control for clients. A link to this section in the WebSphere MQ V7.1 Documentation is as follows:\n\nWebSphere MQ > Security > Planning for your security requirements >> Planning authorization [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/zs14070_.htm]\n\nTechnotes\n\nA Technote is available that explains J2C Authentication Aliases and how they can be used to configure the user identifier flowed to a queue manager when creating a connection: \n\nEnterprise applications, the WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factories and Authentication Aliases explained [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21580097]\n\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers WebSphere Application Server"

They are the result of the way the application server's connection pool works, and not an application issue. The messages can be safely ignored. \n\nThere is a connection pool for every connection factory defined in the application server, which is used for outbound messaging (for example, when applications running inside of WebSphere Application Server send messages to WebSphere MQ). When the connection being used by the Activation Specification is broken, the Activation Specification is stopped and restarted automatically - this ensures that a new connection to WebSphere MQ is established. \n\nAs part of this processing, any outbound connections to the same queue manager in the connection pool are closed off using WebSphere MQ API calls. However, as the connections to the queue manager have been broken, these API calls cannot complete successfully which results in the J2CA0206W, J2CA0056I and CWSJY0003W messages appearing in the SystemOut.log file.",

In the 1-phase commit environment, this syncpoint\n   is committed before the message is returned to the application\n   in the JMS Session AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE scenario.\n   \n   When using the \"MQGMO_SYNCPOINT_IF_PERSISTENT', the MQ-JMS\n   classes used the JMS DeliveryMode value of the consumed message\n   to know if the message consumption act needed to be acknowledged\n   with the queue manager.\n   \n   However, this JMS DeliveryMode value could be derived from two\n   locations within the MQ message:\n   \n   (1) MQMD 'Persistence' field\n   (2) MQRFH2 'Delivery' field, as seen in an MQRFH2 header with\n   the form:\n   \n         <jms>\n             <Dlv dt='i4'>1</Dlv>\n         </jms>\n   \n   If the optional MQRFH2 <Dlv> element is present, as stated in\n   the documentation its value is used to specify the DeliveryMode\n   of the JMS message, regardless of what the MQMD Persistence\n   field is set to.\n   \n   The consequence of this is that if the MQRFH2 Delivery field is\n   present and set to have a value which indicates that the message\n   is NON_PERSISTENT, but the MQMD states that the message is\n   persistent, the message will be handed to the consuming\n   application without committing the syncpoint with the queue\n   manager.  If this cycle is repeated, eventually one of two\n   failures will be encountered, depending upon which resource\n   limit is encountered first:\n   \n   (a) The queue manager will run out of transaction log space, and\n   report a MQRC 2003 'MQRC_BACKED_OUT' back to the JMS\n   application, via the exception seen above.\n   \n   (b) The queue manager will reach its configured maximum\n   syncpoint limit, and will report a MQRC 2024\n   'MQRC_SYNCPOINT_LIMIT_REACHED' back to the application.

Reason: Server chose SSLv3, \nbut that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client. javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Server chose SSLv3, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.\n\n\nCAUSE\nDWC 9.3 is packaged with WAS 8.5.5.4 and due to known vulnerabilities has SSLV3 disabled. However TWS 9.2 and earlier versions use SSLv3 by default and so the DWC 9.3 cannot connect\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nYou can solve this problem by configuring your TWS engines to use TLS instead of SSL :\n\n\nBackup and edit : \n\nTWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/config/cells/TWSNodeCell/security.xml \n\nFind sslProtocol and change \"SSL_TLS\" to \"TLS\" \n\nFind ssl.protocol and change value=\"SSL\" to value=\"TLS\" \n\nBackup and edit : \n\nTWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/properties/ssl.client.props \n\nFind com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS \n\nBackup and edit : \n\nTWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/temp/ssl.client.props \n\nFind com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS \n\nStop and restart WAS. \n\n*Be aware that your Engines are now using TLS and so you must also reconfigure any DWC 9.2 or 9.1 installations that need to connect to those engines. You would change them to use TLS in the same way as above but also by the same changes in these copies of security.xml and ssl.client.props : \n\nTWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml \n\nTWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/properties/ssl.client.props \n\nTWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/temp/ssl.client.props \n\nPlease consider that since you configure with TLS the WAS of TWS Engine also the Dynamic Agent can be impacted. \n\nSee technote 1689332."

Changing this value to 3 allows for a sync of what is in\n   memory to be written to the disk prior to the reboot occurring\n   ... this means that valuable syslog, error report, trace and\n   db2diag.log messages will be saved.\n   \n   chrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode CritRsrcProtMethod=3\"\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  Refer to bullets 1 and 3 of this technote:\n   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21624179 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21624179]\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *\n   * Users using db2haicu in  TSA/HADR setup                      *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *\n   * See Error Description                                        *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *\n   * Users can upgrade to DB2 Version 10.1 fix pack 5 or higher   *\n   * to avoid this defect                                         *\n   ****************************************************************\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  First fixed in DB2 Version 10.1 fix pack 5\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IT03035\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   DB2 FOR LUW\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   DB2FORLUW\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   A10\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2014-07-08\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2015-08-12\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2015-08-12\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n    IT08690 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT08690]\n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   DB2 FOR LUW\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   DB2FORLUW\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * RA10 PSN\n   UP",

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n IBM web server Plug-in provides the connection between the web server tier and the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) tier.\n\nWhen using Apache 2.2 web server on Linux operating systems, the IBM web server Plug-in may need to have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set in a certain way, in order to be able to locate the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) libraries needed for SSL (HTTPS).\n\nWithout the GSKit libraries, the IBM web server Plug-in will be unable to initialize SSL, and will use only HTTP for connections to the WAS appservers. \n\nSYMPTOM\nDuring web server start-up, errors like the following will be logged into the Plug-in log file (http_plugin.log): \n\nERROR: lib_security: loadSecurityLibrary: Failed to load gsk library from /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64\nERROR: ws_transport: transportInitializeSecurity: Unable to load security library\nERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: Failed to initialize security\nERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: HTTPS Transport is skipped\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo resolve the problem, you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the library directory of the GSKit that comes with the IBM web server Plug-in. The precise directory location will depend of the version of Plug-in, and on the bit depth being used (32-bit or 64-bit). \n\n \n\nFor example..... \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_32/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_64/lib64/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_32/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64/lib64/ \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease note that for Apache 2.2 on Linux, simply setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable from the command line prior to starting the web server, MAY NOT WORK. In that case, you must set this variable as follows...\n\nFor SLES and SUSE Linux add the export command into the /usr/sbin/envvars file.\n\nFor RHEL Linux add the export command into the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file.\n\nBy adding the export command into the files shown above, it means that the environment variable will be set when the web server is started. That will enable the Plug-in to be able to locate the appropriate GSKit libraries and be able to initialize SSL transports. \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Web server plug-in setupGSKitLibPath script contains in [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21441018]"

In some cases when the web server is partially configured for SSL/TLS communications, the \"UseInsecure=true\" custom property will be ignored. In this case, you would need to disable the HTTPS transport for the Application Server to use non-SSL between the plugin and the application server. IBM strongly does not recommend disabling the HTTPS transport for your application server since this would prevent all secure HTTPS connections to your application server.\n\nNOTE: This process allows non-secure communications between the Web Server Plug-in and the WebSphere Application Server. If you would like these communications to be secure, please refer to the recommendation above on how to \"Configure the Web Server plugin to accept SSL/TLS communications\".\n\n=================================================================\n\nImplement the \"UseInsecure=true\" custom plug-in property for your web server definition.\n\nYou can implement the \"UseInsecure-true\" custom plug-in property to allow HTTPS traffic to be redirected to the HTTP transport. This enables WAS to function like it did at WAS v8.0 and earlier. If you want to allow the Web Server plugin to create non-secure connections when secure connections are defined (the old behavior), you will need to create the custom property UseInsecure=true on the Servers > Web Servers > Web_server_name > Plug-in properties > Custom properties page in the IBM WebSphere Integrated Solution Console application for the failing WebSphere Profile. Then, restart your application server and web server for the changes to take affect.\n\nThis issue is documented in the following URL: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM85452 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM85452]\n\n- Open a session to the IBM WebSphere Integrated Solution Console for your WebSphere Profile.\n- Expand Servers -> Server Types and click on \"Web servers\".\n\nScreen shot of the WAS ISC showing Servers -> Server Types - Web servers [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019946&amp;aid=1]\n\n- Click on your HTTP Server instance name.\n- Click on the \"Plug-in properties\" link under \"Additional Properties\" on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nScreen shot of the WAS ISC showing Plug-in properties under Additional Properties on the Web Servers page.

All widgets will retain values for subscribed events such as 'dataRefresh' and 'timeSet' \n\nTo use 'dataRefresh' and 'timeSet' properties of subscribed events for any widgets which are added after first \"Save\" or \"Save and Exit\", DASH support will need to be contacted. \n\nNote: This issue is with the widgets which are placed on the page after first \"Save\" or \"Save & Exit\""

      "Monitor; 7.0; 7.0.0.2; Fix Pack DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n This document describes the features and fixes in Fix Pack 2 for WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0. (Note: This is the first Fix Pack for Version 7.0.) \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n * New features included in WebSphere Business Monitor with this Fix Pack \n * Issues resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor with this Fix Pack \n * Issues resolved in Business Space with this Fix Pack\n\n\n\nNew features included in WebSphere Business Monitor with this Fix Pack \n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the new features in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2. \n\nFeature Description Updated Information Center The IBM WebSphere Business Monitor 7.0 Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.doc/home/home.html] has been updated for V7.0.0.2.\n\nIf you have a locally installed version of the documentation, see Updating the local information center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.inst.doc/inst/ic_update.html]. Alphablox 9.5.7 build 52 WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2 updates Alphablox 9.5.7 to build 52. This addresses the following issues in Alphablox:\n * The duration format mask does not handle an Arabic locale number. \n * The Alphablox BloxBuilder service causes log4j plug-in collisions with other applications that use log4j.\n\nWindows 7 support WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2 adds support for the Windows 7 operating system. \nBusiness Object Runtime Framework Version 7 is available in V7.0 Fix Pack 2 as a technology preview WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus have enabled a new business object runtime framework as a Technology Preview in the 7.0.0.1 Fix Pack. The business object runtime framework provided in all the previous Version 6.x releases continues to be the default in version 7 and remains the business object runtime framework for production use. After applying the 7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Fix Packs, the new business object runtime framework for version 7 is also available. While available to all users of 7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2, current usage of the version 7 business object runtime framework is designed for and should only be used by early adopters and for development usage only. IBM provides the version 7 business object runtime framework technology preview \"as is\" and does not include IBM support as specified in the version 7 WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus license agreement under the terms for Technology Preview Code. Feedback and questions regarding version 7 business object runtime framework can be directed to the WebSphere Process Server forum [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=820].\n\n\n\nIssues resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor with this Fix Pack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows all of the issues resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2. \n\n\nAPAR Problem Description JR34783 With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, the Dimensions and Reports widgets do not always correctly resize when the browser window is resized. JR34980 If multiple consecutive events fail to be processed for a monitor model due to \"no correlation match\", all of the event processing threads may deadlock, resulting in event processing halting for the model. JR34992 When the Instances widget is refreshed, any text in the Search field is automatically cleared, forcing you to re-enter the search text if it is still needed. JR35001 With Oracle as the database, with a high volume of open monitoring contexts for a model with recurring wait time triggers, processing of the triggers might result in the following SQLException:ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000 JR35017 When the browser language is Hebrew, duration values are not displayed correctly. JR35073 When using queue bypass event routing, event consumption by the moderator from the INBOUND_EVENTS table may perform slowly, especially if there are a large number of events in the table. JR35077 With queue bypass event routing, if the event consumption batch size (monitor model runtime configuration parameter) is set to 1000 (its maximum value), when the moderator attempts to query the INCOMING_EVENTS table to retrieve unconsumed events, the query will fail and no events will be consumed. An error message indicating an SQL error will be written to the moderator SystemOut.log file, at each attempt to consume events. JR35114 During data replication by Data Movement Service, the database transaction log may fill during a preprocessing step, causing the replication to fail. The SystemOut.log file will contain the following error: SQLCODE: -964, SQLSTATE: 57011 JR35121 When you configure the Dimensions widget to use the cube \"<model name> (All Versions)\" for a monitor model with multiple versions deployed, and the dimensional model for the monitor model has been changed between deployed versions, the widget might not display correct information. JR35142 In the Instances view, if you apply a time filter using a time zone other than GMT, the instance export function will not export the correct set of data based on the time filter; it incorrectly behaves as if the time zone in the filter specification is GMT. JR35147 When an SCA notification alert is generated (by the action services component), the alert generation fails and the following error message is written to SystemOut.log: \n\ncom.ibm.wbimonitor.actionmgr.handling.ScaHandler handleEvent (CommonBaseEvent, int, Hashtable) CWMAA2119E: SCA is not available on this platform. Notification not completed. JR35195 In Windows Vista, when using the Microsoft Excel add-in, clicking Preferences to assign a Monitor server to the add-in does not display the dialog box. JR35218 A change to the notification type in a notification template is not reflected in the notifications sent when an outbound event matching a situation event binding (to which the template is associated) is generated. JR35256 The moveMCInstances script may fail with an exception similar to the following:\n\n000000a0 QueueRecovery E com.ibm.wbimonitor.repository.QueueRecoveryUtil doMigrationForMC(MonitoringContextType oldMC) <Null Message> com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.SqlException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-805, SQLSTATE=51002, SQLERRMC=NULLID.SYSLN2030X5359534C564C3031, DRIVER=3.52.110 JR35273 When an e-mail notification for an alert is generated, if during user lookup and validation the federated repository returns an unexpected object (in response to a query issued by Monitor), the e-mail notification will not be sent to any intended user. JR35278 The \"less than\" character ('<') in a KPI name or description causes the Alert Manager widget to fail. JR35313 In the Instances widget, if you are specifying a data filter and enter a string in the \"Search for:\" field that includes a single quote character ('), the search will fail and the displayed instance data will not be refreshed to reflect the data filter. You may see a red 'X', or an error message. JR35452 Resubmission of a failed event sequence may fail with an exception similar to the following:\n\n00000075 ConsumerBeanE E com.ibm.wbimonitor.mm.myModelMM.20100420000000.moderator.ConsumerBeanEventResubmission processMessagesInNormalState CWMRT0044E: An unrecognized error occurred while processing an event. The message will be retried.\nMonitoring Model ID: myModelMM \nMonitoring Model Version: 20091211000000\nCaused by: com.ibm.wbimonitor.server.moderator.exception.\nUnknownEventException: com.ibm.wbimonitor.persistence.exceptions. \nUnknownEventIdException: Unknown DB ID : 88A3F6731D8B5D10E35823C4\n\nWhen this occurs, no additional failed event sequences are processed. JR35504 If WebSphere Business Monitor is installed on the same stand-alone server as ILOG \nand WebSphere Business Services Fabric, when you try to create the schema for an monitor model, the following error occurs:\n\ncom.ibm.wbimonitor.lifecycle.LifecycleServices getMonitorDBUser(String) Did not find user name for datasource jdbc/wbm/MonitorAdminDatabase. JR35547 When the CEI distribution mode for a monitor model (version) is \"Active (no new MC instances)\", an inbound event received by the model version that does not correlate to any existing instance may remain in the CONSUMED_EVENT table, causing event processing to effectively halt. JR35563 If an LDAP server is not configured for, or does not support, lookup of users by e-mail address, e-mail alert notification may fail. JR35575 In the Dimensions and Reports widgets, the \"Show Instances\" function may display too many instances in the Instances widget, due to incorrect filtering. JR35592 The cube refresh settings configured for the scheduled service for Alphablox cube caching are not reflected in the Dimensions portlet in WebSphere Portal. JR35598 When a monitor model is running, it may encounter a condition that requires the model to automatically restart itself to recover; this restart fails because the shutdown phase cannot complete. JR35602 In the KPI widget, if a decimal KPI is displayed as a gauge or half gauge and does not have any user-defined ranges, the following display issues occur:\n * If the KPI value is smaller than 5, and the decimal precision is 0, some values displayed on the tick marks repeat, \n * The values displayed on the tick marks may not be uniformly spaced and may not accurately represent integer values.\n\nJR35659 If events and instances are manually deleted from the failed event queue tables (tables named EQ_*), then failed event processing may cease to function correctly. JR35707 When a monitor model that is using queue based event routing is restarted, events will not be processed if events that were previously consumed by the model had not been fully removed from database tables used during consumption at the time the model was last stopped. JR35708 An expression evaluation error during event processing may cause event processing to loop infinitely (processing the same event repeatedly). JR35737 In the WebSphere Business Monitor test environment, when a monitoring context ID contains non-ASCII characters (for example, Portuguese characters), all metrics will always be \ndisplayed even if only some metrics are selected to be displayed. This issue only occurs in the test environment and not in the WebSphere Business Monitor (server) product. JR35792 When you uninstall an older version of a monitor model, where the newest version is using queue bypass transport and the older version was using queue based transport, the JMS queues used by the older version are removed, but bindings to the queues are not removed. As a result, event consumption in the newest version stops due to a failed attempt to resolve the bindings in the newest version. JR35938 The Unrecoverable Events page in the administrative console does not display any events for a monitoring context if a count of 1 event is displayed for the monitoring context. JR36063 When the script ConfigCEIForMQClients to establish the MQ to CEI link is executed, it fails with the error \"CEI service integration bus was not found.\" JR36120 The following internally identified issues have been resolved:\n\nIssues in monitor model installation:  * If you install a second monitor model immediately after installing the first, without leaving the Monitor Models page in the administrative console, the second monitor model will fail to install with an error message stating that there is a save conflict in saving the changes to the master configuration. \n * Need to improve the error message displayed during model installation when it cannot be determined whether CEI routing plug-ins are installed on the CEI target server. \n * When the target CEI server is not running during model installation, it cannot be determined whether CEI routing plug-ins are installed. \n * The deployment manager must be running for a monitor model to be installed successfully, in a network deployment environment. (V7.0.0.2 removes this dependency.) \n * You cannot install a monitor model in a cross-cell configuration where the remote CEI target is in a WebSphere Process Server V7.0 cell running on z/OS. \n * Headless deploy does not install a monitor model for which the .mm file is located in a subdirectory within the specified project interchange file.\n\n\nOperational issues:  * With WebSphere Application Server V7.0.0.9, a monitor model using queue based event routing may be subject to locked message conditions (error CWMRT0031E written to SystemOut.log), during which time no inbound events will be consumed. \n * There is a memory leak in the com.ibm.wbimonitor.xsp.eventselector plug-in, which can manifest itself on a WebSphere server hosting CEI under certain error conditions. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, Data Movement Service performs slowly. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, there is an intermittent error in Data Movement Service. \n * In the emitter REST services, if tracing is enabled (trace string includes \"com.ibm.wbimonitor.emitter.*=all\"), a NullPointerException will occur when the emitter sends an event with an XML header. \n * In the Global Human Task monitor model, when a human task is completed, the associated DELETED event fails to correlate with any instance (it is always routed to the failed events queue). \n * The xs:dayTimeDuration function may return an incorrect result if time zone information is not provided in each of the dateTime elements (literals or XPath expressions) in the expression used as the argument to the function; the result will be dependent on the system time zone. \n * When the time zone of a DateTime value is GMT, the time zone information is not included in the value. \n * The Alphablox application versions are not written to SystemOut.log at startup.\n\n\nIssues in the administrative console:  * With Oracle as the database, enablement of Data Movement Service from the administrative console fails. \n * In the administrative console, when you save the \"Error handling\" tab under Monitor Models > <model_name>_<version> > Change runtime configuration, the \"Stop if an event that cannot be interpreted is received\" checkbox is turned off any time you save changes to the runtime configuration, even if you do not modify that setting.\n\n\nIssues in the Microsoft Excel add-in:  * The Instances page size setting is not saved from the Preferences dialog. \n * The refresh interval setting is not saved from the Preferences dialog if the Instances page size setting is also changed.\n\n\nIssues in the WebSphere Business Monitor widgets:  * Monitor widgets execute multiple endpoint lookups when only one is required (performance impact). \n * The KPI widget needs to optimize how it retrieves KPI ranges when there are multiple KPIs. \n * With a large number of KPIs in the KPI widget, the bottom of the widget pane may extend through other widgets on the page. \n * Setting the \"Enable this widget to send events over wires\" checkbox for two widgets in a page created from the Monitor template does not automatically wire the widgets together. \n * In the KPI History and Prediction widget, when creating a KPI prediction model for a KPI with no time period for aggregation function AVG, the widget hangs (an error message popup should be displayed instead). \n * With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, the Save Format button is not readily visible when the Dimensions widget is opened in edit mode. \n * The KPI widget in the mobile dashboard does not work correctly. \n * When you open or refresh any page which contains the Alert Manager widget, the following message is written to SystemOut.log as an error ('E') but should be informational ('I'): 0000003b BusinessSitua E com.ibm.wbimonitor.actionmgr.resources.apis.BusinessSituationResourceAccess getBusinessSituations() SECURITY_ENABLED seen \n * In the Alert Manager widget, the Search field only automatically adds a wildcard character to the end of the entered word, and not the beginning of the word. \n * After migration from Version 6.1.2 to Version 7.0, no data appears in the Reports widget. \n * After migration from Version 6.1.2 to Version 7.0, the cube for a migrated model can no longer be configured in the Dimensions or Reports widget (the error \"Unable to load\u2026\" is displayed). \n * After migration from previous versions of WebSphere Business Monitor to Version 7, when a model is redeployed to Version 7, KPIs and alerts previously created in the dashboard are not preserved.\n\n\nIssues in the Global Process monitor model:  * If multiple versions of the Global Process model are installed, outbound events that are sent back to the model get sent to all installed versions, not just the latest version. \n * The Global Process model cannot monitor ad hoc tasks. \n * Subtask hierarchies are not sorted by the \"Aus Start Time Hierarchy\" metric by default. \n * When you click the Process Statistics tab or Task Statistics tab in the pre-configured space for the Global Process model, a warning message is displayed stating that a saved query is no longer in the database. \n * The column \"Indented Name\" is not shown by default in the \"Subtask hierarchy\" tab in the pre-configured space for the Global Process model. \n * Two defined events are missing step qualified names.\n\n\nIssues in the Profile Management Tool / manageprofiles command:  * The Profile Management Tool might incorrectly display \"null\" for two fields for the CEI database in the Summary panel when the database is already configured. \n * In the Profile Management Tool, the label for the \"DB2 client\" checkbox for the CEI database implies that it needs to be checked for a local CEI database. \n * In the Profile Management Tool, Type 2 data source creation does not work (even if selected, a Type 4 data source is created). \n * Profile update does not support system commands. \n * The manageprofiles script does not create the database script output directory if it does not already exist, causing it to fail. \n * The -wbmDBJDBCClasspath parameter for the manageprofiles command does not have a default value if the database is DB2 z/OS V9.1.\n\n\nIssues in the Installation Verification Tool:  * The CEI data source might not be located, even if it is configured correctly. \n * Uninstallation of the Mortgage Lending model fails.\n\n\nOther issues:  * With Derby as the database, profile creation fails if the schema name is not upper case (i. e. lower case or mixed case). \n * The authentication alias set for the Monitor admin data source during profile creation is the Monitor authentication alias, not the Monitor admin authentication alias. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, if the driver is type 2, the Monitor data source is created incorrectly. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, a type 2 driver might encounter issues caused by a data source pre-test. \n * When a WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition profile is augmented with Monitor, the CEI data store component is disabled. \n * In the WebSphere test environment, WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition cannot be selected as the base server profile for Monitor augmentation. \n * The runAAMExport.sh and runAAMEncrypt.sh scripts do not work correctly. \n * The properties file for the MM App Updater tool needs to clearly document that values cannot have trailing spaces. \n * If the deployment environment wizard fails, or changes get discarded after the wizard completes, a portion of the configuration gets saved. \n * \"wbmDeployBusinessSpace\" is listed as a valid command in the help for the \"BusinessMonitorConfiguration\" wsadmin task. \n * Database (persistence) tracing for failed event management is not available.\n\n\n\n\nIssues resolved in Business Space with this Fix Pack \n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows all of the issues resolved in Business Space in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.2. \n\nAPAR Problem Description JR35235 During the creation of a Deployment Environment (using the Deployment Environment creation wizard in the administrative console), if you specify Oracle9i as the database, then the Deployment environment creation fails with the following error:\n\n00000036 WBI_BSpace_Cm E\ncom.ibm.wbiserver.nd.topology.commands.impl.WBI_BSpace_Cmd \nconfigure CWLDB9014E: The configuration of component WBI_BSPACE failed.\nReason\ncom.ibm.wbi.utils.configservice.WBIConfigException: BCSB1103I: \nThe selected database is not supported by Business Space..... JR35309 The following internally identified issues have been resolved (note that all of these issues were originally resoved in Business Space V7.0 Interim Fix 1):\n\nIssues within the Lotus Mashups embedded component:  * After creating a space that is not designated as a favorite, the space shows up in the Favorites view (although refreshing the page removes the space from the Favorites view). \n * After exporting a page, and then re-importing the page back into Business Space, the language used in the page may suddenly change. \n * If the owner of a space changes a page in the space (for example, dragging a widget onto the page), but the space owner is changed before the page is saved, when the new owner accesses the page, the changes made by the original space owner are lost. \n * After hiding spaces in the space manager, sometimes the visual indicator that tells you that the space is hidden does not display. \n * After changing a page owner to a different user, when you attempt to change the page owner a second time, the first owner remains the page owner. \n * When you search for users using a partial name, the results do not display the users that meet that search criteria. For example, if you type \"a\" in the search field and start the search, no users are found, even those users who have names that start with that character. \n * When using Internet Explorer, when you open and close various dialog boxes, you may notice a memory leak in your browser, sometimes as high as 5 MB for each open-and-close action. This occurs in the following scenarios:. \n * Drag a widget onto a page, click the configuration icon at the top of the widget, and select Edit Settings. After you close the configuration dialog box, you may experience close to 1MB of memory leak. \n * You may also notice memory leaks when working with pages continuously for long periods of time. \n * When working in a clustered server environment, you may notice that pages do not load properly because they fail to retrieve the default page theme. \n * Events do not get sent multiple times across pages. \n * Dependency/catalog federation issues exist involving URLs without ports and case-insensitive hostname comparisons.\n\n\nIssues in Portal migration:  * An exception may occur during layout migration, causing some pages to fail to migrate. \n * Configuration information for some widgets is lost during migration, causing those widgets to not work properly after migration. \n * After migration, some widgets may hang while loading. \n * Private pages cannot be migrated. \n * Migration of WPS/WESB Version 6.2 feature pack widgets is not supported. \n * The Draft Projects widget (in Business Compass) and ProcessDefinitionList widget (in Human Task Management) do not load on Portal after migration. \n * Changes to page layout prior to migration are not preserved; the resulting layout is always the three columns layout.\n\n\nOther migration issues:  * Changes to widget size prior to data migration are not preserved; the widget size after migration is always the default size. \n * Wiring information for widgets does not correctly migrate from previous releases. \n * Access control lists relating to user distinguished names are not migrated correctly.\n\n\nConfiguration issues:  * Business Space configuration fails to augment a profile to use an existing local SQL Server database. \n * Manual configuration of Business Space with WebForm Server fails. \n * Augmentation of a profile for Business Space to use an existing local SQL Server reports that the database operation failed. \n * With DB2 z/OS as the database, the data source used by Business Space is created incorrectly during profile configuration, storing a database name instead of a connection/database location name.\n\n\nNavigation/display issues:  * If you click \"Home\" inside a page with unsaved changes, you are not prompted to save your changes and so the changes are lost. \n * When you navigate away from a page with a hidden widget, a NullPointerException occurs. \n * If a page is hidden from the view list, the page edit setting dialog does not close when you click the Save button. \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, in drop down menus, if the text is wider than the field, excess white space is displayed on the left and right side of the drop down button. (The text will now occupy the entire width of the field without the excess white space.) \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, a security warning dialog appears after a widget's menu item is selected and then a page tab is clicked. \n * When using Internet Explorer, the edit panel of the Script Adapter widget is stretched to take the entire width of the browser window. \n * When using Internet Explorer, the edit panel of the Script Adapter and Website widgets are not the correct size. \n * When using Internet Explorer in a right-to-left environment (Arabic or Hebrew), moving the mouse over a widget results in the widget being drawn in an incorrect position. \n * When using Firefox, the Web Feed widget is not visible when it is displayed on a page outside of Business Space. \n * The content of a widget in the top row of a multi-row layout (T, I or inverted T) changes size based on content and overlaps the widgets in the row below it. \n * When using the Task Information widget to display a completed task form, the read-only fields of the form are not greyed out when displaying the form using Webform Server. \n * The sample URLs for the following widgets: Spreadsheet, Document and Presentation require a leading slash in URL location to load. \n * When displaying event information in the Script Adapter widget, an error value is shown when the event payload type is numeric or is empty. \n * Using a direct URL to open a space without providing a page ID causes an error. \n * When you view a global page within a space and then log out, the next time you log in the global page is still visible, but appears within a different space. \n * The wiring dialog displays the event code name instead of the event title (as defined in the widget XML). \n * Some translation issues exist for the Portuguese-Brazilian language.\n\n\nOther operational issues:  * When using SQLServer with the Data Direct JDBC driver to retrieve Blob data type personalization data, an exception is encountered. \n * When using Internet Explorer 7, there is a memory leak. \n * The GZIPOutputStream has a memory leak.\n\nJR36106 Business Space does not display the owner name after the creation of a space in some scenarios. JR36435 The following additional internally identified issues have been resolved:\n\nIssues within the Lotus Mashups embedded component:  * When you attempt to leave a unsaved page and go to another page, a dialog box displays that prompts you to either save or undo your changes. If you click Undo several times, and then click Save, the page you are trying to access is unexpectedly replaced by the page you just saved. \n * Users with view permission incorrectly have certain edit rights for spaces. When using the tabbed theme, sometimes users who have only view permission for a space can reorder the pages in that space, but only users with edit permission should be able to reorder pages in spaces. (In V7.0.0.2, only users with edit permission can reorder pages in spaces.) \n * When you attempt to create a new space with an unsaved page open, the dialog box that prompts you to save the page displays twice.\n\n\nMigration issues:  * The batch files for updating the Business Space database schema cannot be invoked on non-Windows platforms after profile migration. The files that are generated by Business Space do not have execution privilege.\n\n\nConfiguration issues:  * Database related exceptions occur if Business Space and DB2 are configured on the same z/OS image. \n * The Team List widget service endpoints must always end with a '/', for example, http://myserver:9080/UserImageWeb/UserImageServlet/images/. \n * The currentSQLID custom property always has to be assigned additional privileges for the Business Space data source. (In V7.0.0.2, this property has been removed.) \n * If you run the administrative task \"configureBusinessSpace\" with the \"-replaceDatasource\" parameter, an error message saying that the JNDI value \"jdbc/mashupDS\" (data source) exists is displayed. \n * When profiles are upgraded after maintenance is applied (Interim Fix or Fix Pack), existing endpoints will default to the original Business Space endpoint locations, possibly overwriting custom endpoints. \n * Additional command line help text is needed for Business Space administrative tasks.\n\n\nNavigation/display issues:  * With Internet Explorer 7 as the browser, in the Team List widget, when the hierarchy of a team is three or more levels deep, the tree does not show the third level correctly. \n * With Internet Explorer as the browser, in the Palette, if Hebrew or Arabic is the browser language, the order of the parentheses for the number of viewers is incorrect. \n * With Internet Explorer as the browser, if option 'script debugging(Internet Explorer)' is turned on, login with a non-secure profile fails, and no script error is displayed. \n * With Internet Explorer 6 as the browser, the height of a widget after maximize and restore fills the entire height of the column. \n * Maximizing any widget causes it to be sized larger than the current browser window instead of filling the window. \n * When a widget is configured with a default height, the default height is not applied. \n * The positioning of fly-out menus in the wiring diagram causes the menu to cover the wrong portion of the diagram. \n * After login to Business Space, a Log in button might be shown in the top right of the main page instead of a Log out button. (When this occurs, no spaces or pages are available to display, but selecting Log in allows login to proceed without prompting for user name and password, after which the appropriate space and page is displayed.) \n * With Internet Explorer 6 as the browser, changes to widget size are not persisted when changing pages or logging out. \n * When loading a page containing wires, some wires may not be active. \n * Some widget styles may be applied incorrectly depending on the order of items on the page. \n * If you create a new page while editing the current page, the current page is not saved correctly when you start the new page creation. \n * If you change pages while editing the current page, the current page is not saved correctly before the page change occurs, and the modified content replaces the content of the page you are switching to. \n * You might be prompted to save or undo changes when navigating away from a space with no change to it. \n * Java\u2122Script exceptions occur when using bi-directional locales. \n * Timing related issues might occur when loading a page with multiple widgets, where the iWidgets have the same resource file dependencies. \n * When the edit settings of the ScriptAdapter widget is selected for a second time during the same Business Space session, the dialog for the Script Adapter widgets settings does not display.\n\n\nOther operational issues:  * Accessibility support in the Business Space framework and Business Space common widgets is incomplete. \n * Business Space enforces HTTPS during logon. (In V7.0.0.2, this restriction has been removed.) \n * A benign exception message about Trust Association is written to SystemOut.log.\n\nPREREQUISITES\n \n\n * Please ensure that your WebSphere Business Monitor environment meets the system requirements documented at: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018594 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018594] \n * You must be at WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0. \n * Important: WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0 Fix Pack 2 includes an update for Business Space.

The following example shows the structure of a page widget definition file. For examples of page widget properties, see \"Defining a property.\" For examples of page widget events, see \"Defining an event>\" \n\n\n{\n    \"id\":\"CustomInbasket\",\n    \"title\":\"Custom Inbasket\",\n    \"category\":\"EducationWidgets\",\n    \"description\":\"EN description of Custom Inbasket\",\n    \"definition\":\"CustomInbasket.json\",\n    \"preview\":\"images/custom/custominbasket_preview.gif\",\n    \"icon\":\"images/custom/custominbasket_icon.gif\",\n    \"runtimeClassName\":\"icm.pgwidget.inbasket.CustomInbasket\",\n    \"previewThumbnail\":\"images/custom/custominbasket_thumb.gif\",\n    \"properties\":[\n    ],\n    \"events\":[\n \n    ]\n}\n\n\nDEFINING AN ACTION DEFINITION FILE\nThe action definition file is a JSON file that provides detailed information about a custom action that is used for page widgets. You must provide a definition file for each custom action in your custom widget package.\n\nWhen you develop an action, you should create a Java class that inherits from the com.ibm.ecm.extension.PluginAction class. In your class, override getAdditionalConfiguration() method to return a JSON object. \n\nThe following example shows a JSON object: \n\n\n{\"ICM_ACTION_COMPATIBLE\": true,\n    \"context\": null,\n    \"name\": \"Custom Add Case Action\",\n    \"description\": \"An action to add cases from other solution\",\n    \"properties\": [\n       {\n          \"id\": \"label\",\n          \"title\": \"Add a custom Case\",\n          \"defaultValue\": \"Custom Add Case\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"isLocalized\":false\n       },\n       {\n          \"id\": \"solution\",\n          \"title\": \"Solution\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"isLocalized\":false\n       },\n       {\n          \"id\": \"caseType\",\n          \"title\": \"Case Type\",\n          \"defaultValue\": \"\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"isLocalized\":false\n       }\n    ],\n    \"events\":[\n       {\n          \"id\":\"icm.OpenAddCasePage\",\n          \"title\":\"Open Add custom Case Page\",\n          \"direction\":\"published\",\n          \"type\":\"broadcast\",\n          \"description\":\"Open Add Custom Case Page\"\n       }\n    ]\n};The following table describes the properties that are supported for an action definition file:\n\n\n             \n               \n               \n                 \n                 Property \n                 Required or \n\nOptional \n                 Type \n                 Description \n                 \n                 \n                 ICM_ACTION_COMPATIBLE \n                 Required \n                 Boolean \n                 A Boolean value that is set to true if the action can be used in the IBM Case Manager action framework.

The following values are valid for the type property:\n\n                   * iterator\n   Specify this value if the action is defined using a method such as getIterator(). The method returns a series of items which are rendered as buttons or menu items.\n   \n   \n * checkbox\n   The action is rendered as a checkbox in the toolbar or pop-up menu. If you sent the type property to this value, you must also set the fieldname property to checkbox.\n   \n   \n\n \n                 \n                 \n                 fieldname \n                 Required \n                 String \n                 If the type property is set to checkbox, you must set this property to the identifier of a property that is defined in the properties array.\nIf type property is not set to checkbox, omit the fieldname property.\n\n \n                 \n                 \n                 description \n                 Required \n                 String \n                 A string that provides a brief description of the action. \n                 \n                 \n                 context \n                 Required \n                 Array \n                 An array that indicates the contexts in which the action can be used.

      "600limitation 601limitation 700limitation xg xi ve virtual edition upgrade AMP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When you use AMP to upgrade firmware or when you send a large AMP request to a virtual DataPower appliance, the appliance might encounter an out of memory condition and reload. You will see the following error message in system log:\n\n\"Throttler forced a system reload. Reason : Low Memory\" \n\nSYMPTOM\nIn the following situations, the virtual appliance encounters an out of memory condition and reloads: \n\n * A firmware upgrade via AMP fails \n * An AMP request fails to send\n\n\nCAUSE\nDataPower consumes memory to process AMP messages. When an AMP message is large and the required memory to process an AMP message exceeds available memory, the DataPower appliance runs out of memory and reloads.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe problem is limited to the DataPower virtual appliances.\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen you use AMP to do firmware upgrade or you send a large AMP request to a virtual appliance and then the DataPower virtual appliance reloads, the system log might contain the following message: \n\n\n20140507T124717Z [file][success][0x8240002a] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): Creating file \"config:/temp_00010\"\n20140507T124803Z [sys][failure][0x82400024] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): Throttler forced a system reload. Reason : Low Memory\n20140507T124804Z [conf][success][0x8240001c] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): ssh 'SSH Service' - Operational state down\n20140507T124812Z [sys][success][0x82400013] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): Booting device serial #0000000 DPOS running 1.1, installed 1.1\n20140507T124812Z [sys][success][0x82400015] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): Booting product id 5725 revision None firmware XG45.6.0.0.3\n20140507T124812Z [sys][success][0x82400017] (SYSTEM:default:*:*): Booting build 236646 on 2013/11/11 11:04:50 count 3. Uptime 7076\n\nThe likely cause of the out of memory condition is that the amount of memory that is allocated by the DataPower appliance exceeds the reserved memory for the virtual appliance.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCheck the virtual appliance reserved memory size and increase it to 8 GB or more. Or use the WebGUI to do firmware upgrade.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI52 Virtual Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Service Gateway XG45 Virtual Edition",

The appliance has firmware. The firmware is IBM Proprietary and IBM Confidential. The firmware is updated via one image to upgrade all features as purchased on the appliance. \n         \n      \n      2. Determining the firmware level for your unique business solution: IBM publishes several technotes to help your team determine the appropriate firmware levels for your business solution:  *  Critical updates and actions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21390112] Supported firmware [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21237631], which includes links to the release notes for each version of firmware. Firmware lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21246298] Machine Type end of services dates. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845] One part of the IBM Accelerated Value Program (AVP) is to help you match a firmware level to your business need. If you are interested, see our AVP webpage [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/acceleratedvalue/]. \n         \n      \n      \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Step 2. Identify The Firmware Image File Which Matches Your Appliance \n   The DataPower firmware image file names have the following format or pattern:\n   zzNNNN.licenses.scrypt{3/4}.\n   \n   \n   Otherwise, please follow the steps in this section of the technote. \n   \n   Using the information in this step you will resolve this pattern to the one image file name which matches your appliance, for example: idg7700.scrypt3 or idg7700.tibco.scrypt3 with the Tibco license. Fix Central has many image files for DataPower appliances; this will help you find the one file. \n   \n   The following steps will help you determine the firmware image file name which will work with your appliance. \n   \n   \n    1. Determine the zz value in zzNNNN.licenses.scrypt{3/4}, which is the appliance model:  1. You can use the DataPower WebGUI to obtain your appliance model. The DataPower model displays on the top left of the banner on every WebGUI page as XI52, XG45, XB62 or IDG. \n        2. The first 2 characters of the model are the \"zz\" in the image format. Using this example throughout this section, for an idg model appliance, the image file name would start with XI: xiNNNN.licenses.scrypt{3/4}. \n       \n       \n    2. The NNNN value in the firmware image file name is the firmware release level.  1. To display the current firmware select Status, look under System and select Firmware Information, or scroll to the bottom of the WebGUI page. The firmware level and model are listed at the end of the selections. Or you can issue the \"show version\" CLI command \n        2. Read this technote to determine which firmware level you wish to install. Supported Firmware versions and recommended upgrade levels for IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21237631] \n        3. Next read the list of critical updates posted by IBM Support in this critical update flash [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390112] to confirm your upgrade image choice has all critical updates included \n        4. The firmware levels are listed in the form x.x.x.x, remove the '.', and this will be the \"NNNN\" in the firmware image. Using our example of xiNNNN.licenses.scrypt{3/4} , if you wish to install 7.6.0.4, NNNN would be 7604. This would be idg7604.licenses.scrypt{3/4} in our example. \n           \n       \n       \n    3. Determine if you need a scrypt3 or scrypt4 file. The scrypt{3/4} value is based on the machine type. To display the hardware generation (machine type), select Administration > Device > System Settings. In the Product ID value, the machine type is the first 4 numbers, For example, 843652X, is machine type or M/T 8436. Match the machine type or M/T:  1. If the display shows \"2426\", \"7199\" or \"7198\", use scrypt of the form zzNNNN.licenses.scrypt3. M/T 7199 and M/T 7198 use scrypt3 files and run V4 or newer firmware. \n        2. If the display shows \"5725\", use scrypt of the form zzNNNN.licenses.scrypt4. M/T 5725 is for Virtual Appliances. \n        3. If the display shows \"8436\" use idgNNN.license.script3\n           \n       \n       \n    4. Check the licenses you purchased on the appliance. This is the \"licenses\" value and you may have more than one license on the appliance.  1. To display the license information select Status, look under System and select \"Device Features\". Note which features are enabled. \n        2. Several licenses will appear. The licenses which affect your choice of image file name (depending on firmware level) are TAM, SQL/ODBC, and TIBCO. Make a note of which of these 4 licenses are displayed to use in the following steps, along with the machine type (M/T) and scrypt{2/3/4} you found. If you have other licenses, they will be updated as appropriate.  1.  If TAM, SQL/ODBC, and TIBCO do not appear, then zzNNNN.scrypt3/4 is the image file name pattern and you can proceed to step 5 \"Here are examples....\", to look at examples. \n            2. XB appliances do not have ODBC in the image file name. \n               \n           \n           \n       \n       \n   \n   \n   With this information you can proceed to the next steps. \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Step 3. Download The Image Which Matches Your Appliance  \n   \n    1.  Go to the Fix Central web site [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral] \n    2.  A user id and password is now needed to access downloads on Fix Central. Here is our technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21579787] with more information. \n    3.  From the Product Group drop-down list, select WebSphere. \n    4.  From the Product drop-down list, select IBM DataPower Gateways. \n    5.  For the Installed Version, choose 7.0.6 for example. \n    6.  Sign in with your IBM Account \n    7.  To limit the result to your DataPower model (XI52, IDG etc.), select the text radio button. \n    8.  In the text file field, use XI to find all the XI52 , XG45 or IDG \n    9.  Select the firmware level \n    10. After you select Agree you will see a list of all the firmware files for an XI52 or the files will be download. Using the information in step 2 you will have identified the one correct image file to use. \n    11. Check the size of the file you downloaded. The file size should be close to the same size as on Fix Central. They will not be exact, but should be very close. \n   \n   \n   If the image files appears as binary in your browser, please right-click and choose Save As from the browser, For help with accessing the Fix Central site, or suggestions to improve Fix Central, click on the feedback button on the Fix Central web page. \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Step 4. Install The Firmware Image. \n   \n   When possible use the WebGUI for firmware upgrades as the WebGUI is easier than issuing several CLI commands. WebGUI/CLI commands are provided for each step where the command exists for both methods. \n   \n   \n    1.  IMPORTANT: Check the firmware on the appliance.  * From the WebGUI, under Status, look under System and select Firmware Information, or scroll to the bottom of the WebGUI page. \n         * From the CLI issue the show version command. \n        \n        \n    2.  Check if this will downgrade the appliance to an older major release level of firmware than currently installed. \n    3.  If you need to downgrade to a different major release such as from 7.7.x.x to 7.7.0.x:. The only supported procedure is first reinitallzie the appliance by following this technote Resetting an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21244384] to install the 7.6.0.x image. A major release is identified by the first three points of the version such as: 7.5.0, 7.6.0 and 7.7.0 which are all separate major releases. \n    4.  Back up the appliance's configuration in a safe location off the appliance. Reference our technote on backup and import features of the appliance. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21416135] \n    5.  Confirm you have a working \"admin\" user ID. \n    6.  IMPORTANT: Create or confirm you have a back up privileged user id which can change the \"admin\" password if needed. See part 2 item 1 in our technote on lost passwords. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21257115] \n    7.  Confirm the passwords for both user IDs have recently been changed and tested to ensure you can access the appliance with each user ID. \n    8.  IMPORTANT: Download and save to another computer any extra or unneeded files. You will want to delete the files from the appliance to make room for the upgrade. \n        \n        Freeing space and saving off unneeded files is important. When you upgrade the firmware the appliance creates a \"roll back image\" which includes the files (for example any logs you might be writing on the appliance), user ids, passwords, etc. This will take up file space on the appliance. The appliance manages file space and you cannot determine all the file space used by a roll back image or other files which the appliance maintains. \n         1. Read our technote: DataPower File system explained [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496334] for more information. You will want to delete the files off the appliance to make room for the upgrade. This will also reduce your \"rollback (boot switch) image size\", Firmware upgrade process creates a boot switch image in case you want to return to previous configuration, firmware, and user files. You should remove unneeded files prior to an upgrade, thus allowing for more space in future upgrades. The amount of file system space needed to upgrade depends on the history of the appliance and previous firmware upgrades. \n         2. Using the WebGUI File management option or CLI commands, remove any unneeded files you might have added from the local, store, and LogStore directories. The WebGUI will be easier to use for this step:  * In the WebGUI navigate to File Management. You can download and delete from the menu options. Click on Help for more information. \n             * From the CLI, issue for each directory and each file to obtain output of the files: \n               config\n               dir local:\n               Review the output completely to determine what you can save then delete. See our technote on copying files to and from the appliance [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250655]. \n               After the files have been safely stored, remove the files from the appliance using the delete command. For example if you have a file called oldfile in the local directory, then delete local:\\\\\\oldfile \n            \n            \n         3. Check if you have enough space.  * From the WebGUI select: \"Status->Filesystem Information\". \n             * Use the CLI: \"show filesystem\" command \n            \n            \n         4. If you are not able to free up enough space by backing up or deleting unneeded files, double check again. You will need a backup of the appliance stored on a computer or server before using these options:  1. From the CLI issue these commands to remove the rollback image to free up more space.\n                config\n                flash\n                boot delete \n             2. You can delete domains, and then import the back-up zip after you have upgraded, via the WebGUI which provides options on what to import. \n             3. You can \"reinit\" the appliance. See: Our resetting an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21244384]. This will clear the appliance and upgrade the firmware image. \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    9.  Save the configuration.  * In the WebGUI, use the \u201cSave Config\u201d option from the top pull down. \n         * From the CLI: write mem\n        \n        \n    10. IMPORTANT: Remove the appliance from the business solution or other environment, so that no traffic is flowing to the device and only the user who is performing the upgrade is logged on.  1. Remove the appliance from load balancers or network environment to stop traffic from going to the appliance. \n         2. Check that there is no traffic flowing on the interfaces.  * In the WebGUI, select Status > IP-Network > Ethernet Interfaces \n             * From the CLI: \n               show int\n               show int mode\n            \n            \n         3. Quiesce the appliance to stop services from processing traffic\n        \n        \n    11. Reboot the appliance to free up resources.  * In the WebGUI navigate to System Control, then under Shutdown reboot the system by setting the mode to Reboot system. Click the Shutdown button, read the pop-up prompts and click the appropriate button. Be sure to wait if the pop-up message informs you to wait before taking any actions. \n         * From the CLI. issue shutdown reboot\n        \n        \n    12. Wait for the appliance to reboot. \n    13. When the appliance reboots, completes, and you have access to the WebGUI, or CLI, upload the firmware image:  * In the WebGUI: navigate to System Control. Next in the Boot Image section click Upload or Fetch to load the image file to the appliance. \n         * From the CLI: use the best copy method to move the image file to the image directory. See our technote on copying files to and from the appliance [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250655]. \n        \n        \n    14. Make sure that the firmware image file is loaded and boot (install) the image:  * In the WebGUI, in the Boot Image section pull down and install the new Firmware by clicking on the \"Accept License\" check box and then click Boot Image, Read the pop-up prompts and click the appropriate button. Be sure to wait if the pop-up message informs you to wait before taking any actions. Do not click on the Close button on the pop-up status notices. The status pop-up will change to a complete status, and you can then click OK. \n         * From the CLI: \n           config \n           dir image: \n           if the image is found, then you can issue:\n           flash \n           boot image accept-license <image name> \n        \n        \n    15. Wait for the appliance to reboot and for the appliance to restart. \n    16. Verify the firmware upgrade was successful:  * In the WebGUI navigate to \"version information\". \n         * From the CLI, use the show version command. \n        \n        \n    17. Un-quiesce the appliance to bring the services online \n    18. Add the appliance back to the business solution (add back to the load balancers or network environment). \n    19. Test and verify the appliance operates correctly per your company's procedures. \n   \n   \n   Note: If, for some reason, you need to go back to the previous firmware level and its configuration, you can toggle between releases by rolling back and forth between the current and the previous image. This includes rolling back between major releases.  * In the WebGui:  1. from the Control Panel, choose System Control. \n       2. in the Firmware Roll-Back section click the \"Firmware Roll-Back\" button to toggle between images. \n      \n      \n    * Using the CLI:  1. Enter the command \"CO\". \n       2. Enter the command \"flash\" press enter. \n       3. Enter the command \"boot switch\" press enter.\n      \n      \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Resolution To Common Problems \n   If the firmware did not upgrade or you have experienced problems after upgrading. Review this information. \n   \n   \n    * \n      A. Check the following first.  1. IMPORTANT: After any failed upgrade attempts, reboot (shutdown reboot) the appliance. \n       2. Check that you followed each step in the section \"Step 4. Install The Firmware Image\". Perform a reboot (shutdown reboot) and try all the steps again. \n       3. When upgrading the firmware on an appliance, make sure you wait until the firmware upgrade completes before entering other commands. In some cases the new majore release \n       4. If the upgrade is not working, check the throttle settings and turn them off temporarily while uploading the image file and upgrading the firmware in Objects -> System Settings-> Throttle Settings. Perform a shutdown reboot, then follow the steps in \"Step 4. Install The Firmware Image\". \n      \n      B. Memory and File space  * Memory: In step 4, there are steps to make sure the appliance is not being used, no traffic, domains disabled, only the person doing the upgrade is logged on, and various times were a reboot is required. This will reduce memory usage. \n       * File system space: In Step 4 there are suggestions on which directories to look at with all the stakeholders which use the appliance. There is a link to a technote on looking at file system use. With your team you can determine which files to store off the appliance or are no longer needed. \n       * For virtual appliances upgrading to some major releases you may not have the space to upload the new image and in this case contact support for a tool to expand the temporary space on the appliance. \n      \n      C. Did you receive an error message?  1.  \"extracting firmware firmware parsing error\":\n          If you see a message indicating \" extracting firmware firmware parsing error\": Download the image file again. The file size should be close to the same size as on Fix Central. They will not be exact, but should be very close. Another possibility is that theWebGui session timed out before the firmware image was completely uploaded. Try increasing the WebGui time out [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21256195] and uploading the image file again.Perform a shutdown reboot, then follow the steps in \"Step 4.

Domains do not show:\n          If after upgrading the firmware, the domains you have configured do not appear: From the WebGUI create each domain with the same name again. The domains and services previously configured should now appear. Otherwise follow these steps to contact IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Support.

Folders and files: \n          Unable to access the folders/files on particular domain after upgrading firmware:\n          While upgrading DataPower firmware, you might notice that the following message does not show up on a particular domain in an error report. \n          For example, on the \"yourTestDomainName\" domain:\n          [yourTestDomainName][mgmt][info] raid-volume(raid0): trans(12345): Installed storage volume access link logstore://ondisk \n          This missing ondisk subdirectory is caused by an asynchronous issue due to a race condition during boot time. A work around method is to issue the 'shutdown reboot' command. The hard disk folders/files should be available after the appliance restarts.\n          \n      \n      E. Connection problems after upgrade:  1. SSL connection errors after upgrade to firmware V4. If you are upgrading to V4 firmware see this technote to change your configuration: SSL connection problems. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497539] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497539] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497539]Examples of connection errors are: http error 0x80e00130 or \"SSL client refused to connect to an insecure SSL Server\" \n       2. Unable to connect using WebGUI or ssh after upgrading firmware:\n          This can occur if you are using a custom cert or authentication for the management services, if any of the associated certs have expired. Expired certs are removed at upgrade time.\n          The first step is to verify that the network is functioning correctly using these commands: \n          show int\n          show int mode\n          show route\n          These commands will show if there is any network activity as well as the connection details such as link speed. Once the network is confirmed the quickest way to recover the web management (WebGUI) and ssh services is to delete them and recreate them with the default settings using the serial console. These commands will reset the RBM's, ACL's, WebGUI and ssh services all to the default settings. Note: If the ssh is working you may omit any commands containing ssh.\n          \n          config\n          web-mgmt\n          no ssl\n          exit\n          write mem\n          y\n          no web-mgmt\n          no ssh\n          rbm\n          reset\n          exit\n          acl web-mgmt\n          reset\n          exit\n          acl ssh\n          reset\n          exit\n          write mem (key step to remove the current settings)\n          y\n          web-mgmt <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is 9090>\n          ssh <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is 22>\n          write mem\n          y\n          Once complete, test the service and confirm you can now access the appliance. Then you may work to configure any custom certs or authentication settings desired.\n      \n      F. Other problems during upgrade:  1. If you are following all the steps in this technote using the WebGUI and the upgrade is still not successful, reboot the appliance, then upload the image via the WebGUI, and use the following CLI commands to upgrade the firmware. (Note: When uploading the firmware image you may rename it to make typing it into the CLI command easier.) If the upgrade fails, save any messages from this session to assist in troubleshooting the upgrade issue.\n          config\n          flash\n          boot image accept-license <image name> \n      \n      \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Considerations when using scripts or programs  \n   \n    1. If you are using scripts or programs to upgrade the appliance firmware, the programs should be designed to follow the same steps a person would perform to prepare the appliance for an upgrade.

For more information, see the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance V2.5 product documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSS8GR_2.5.0/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/whatsnew.html?lang=en]. For a list of fixes and improvements that are included in this fix pack, see the IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale and WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Releases and Updates [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W30b21440b0d9_432c_8e75_b16bac9c5427/page/IBM%20WebSphere%20eXtreme%20Scale%20and%20DataPower%20XC10%20Appliance%20Releases%20and%20Updates] web page.\n\n\nNote: For certain levels of installed firmware, a rolling upgrade of a collective of appliances might lead to a corrupted configuration. Before you attempt a rolling upgrade from V2.5 Fix Pack 3 to this fix pack level, see the technote about this firmware upgrade problem [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692158]. \n\n\nIBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Virtual Appliance for Developers:Download the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Virtual Appliance for Developers [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wsdvad/index.html], which is an open virtual appliance (OVA) package that you can import into your virtualization environment. With this image, you can test and develop with the XC10 software before you create your data grid on the physical appliance.\n\nPREREQUISITES\nTwo firmware upgrades exist for this release. See the following descriptions to determine which firmware upgrade to download: \n\n\nRun the show ssd-version command from a command prompt. If this command does not exist on your system, then, the SSD driver installed in the appliance is level 3.1.1. If the command exists on your system, then the output indicates whether the appliance is at SSD driver level 3.1.1 or 3.2.6; for example:\n\nCommand output from a virtual appliance where there is no SSD card.\nConsole> show ssd-version\nNo version reported. By default, use a firmware not tagged for VSL 3.2.6.\n\nCommand output from a virtual appliance where there is an old SSD card.\nConsole> show ssd-version\nVersion: 3.1.1 build 172. By default, use a firmware not tagged for VSL 3.2.6.\n\nCommand output from an appliance where there is a newer SSD driver:\nConsole> show ssd-version\nVersion: 3.2.6 build 1212. Use a firmware tagged for VSL 3.2.6\n\nAlternatively, in the monitoring console, click Collective > Members. Select a collective member. If the line SSD Version is present, then determine whether the level is 3.2.6 or higher. If so, you have the new driver. If not, then you have the old driver.\n\nFirmware and driver 9005.rel.xc10.scrypt3\n\nThis firmware image contains the VSL 3.1.1 SSD driver. This image includes a firmware driver that is intended for appliances that already contain the VSL 3.1.1 or lower SSD driver. When you install this image, you also upgrade the SSD driver. After you have upgraded, the appliance firmware cannot be rolled back to the previous 2.1.0.0 version. However, you can roll back to the VSL 3.1.1 firmware version that you had before you applied the VSL 3.1.1 SSD driver upgrade.\n\nFirmware and driver 9005.rel.xc10.vsl.3.2.6.scrypt3 \n\nThis firmware image contains the latest VSL 3.2.6 SSD driver. This image includes a firmware driver that is intended for appliances that contain the VSL 3.2.6 or lower version. After you upgrade with this firmware image, the appliance firmware cannot be rolled back to the previous firmware version that you installed for V2.5 Fix Pack 3. Likewise, if you upgrade to this VSL 3.2.6 SSD driver from an existing VSL 3.1.1 SSD driver, then you cannot roll back to the VSL 3.1.1 SSD driver version. However, if you upgrade to a firmware that contains the VSL 3.2.6 SSD driver from an appliance that already contains the VSL 3.2.6 SSD driver, the you can roll back to the previous VSL 3.2.6 firmware version.\n\nAlternatively, use the following table to determine the rollback scenarios for each firmware and driver image:\n\n\n\nBegin with SSD driver Upgrade the firmware using driver Rollback available VSL 3.1.1 VSL 3.1.1 Yes VSL 3.1.1 VSL 3.2.6 No VSL 3.2.6 VSL 3.1.1 You must roll back because this scenario causes the system to fail. VSL 3.2.6 VSL 3.2.6 Yes INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\nComplete the following instructions to download the firmware and client images. \n\n 1. Initialize and configure the appliance.\n    The firmware upgrades for the 7199-92x (2426-92X) appliances are available in this document. See Inihtializing and configuring WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wdpxc/v2r5/topic/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/tinitappl.html] in the product information center for more information about the initialization and firmware upgrade process. \n    \n    Note: The type 7199 appliances can have one of two machine types depending on when they were ordered. Type 2426, listed in parentheses, is the machine type model (MTM) if the appliance is ordered from Passport Advantage. \n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

WebSphere MQ Workflow is only displaying it. This error code is an indication, that MQ was not installed correctly.The MQ error description shows, for example, \"the queue manager's configuration file might be in error.\"\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCheck the following: \n\n\n1. /var/mqm shows the mqs.ini file. You can use the settings listed below as a reference to check your installation:\n\nQueueManager:\nName=FMCQM\nPrefix=/var/mqm\nDirectory=FMCQM\nDefaultQueueManager:\nName=FMCQM\n\n2. /var/mqm/qmgrs/FMCQM contains the qm.ini file. \n\nFor example, for a 3-tier installation with the database on a remote machine called remlupo, where the name of the database is FMCDB, and the database user is fmc with the password fmc:\n\nXAResourceManager:\nName=remlupo FMCDB\nSwitchFile=/usr/lpp/fmc/db2swit/db2swit\nXAOpenString=DB=FMCDB, toc=t, UID=fmc, PWD=fmc\nThreadOfControl=THREAD\n\n\n3. Also check the contents of the MQ error log AMQERR01.LOG. The log files have the same name. You need to check them in the following locations (for a default configuration):\na) /var/mqm/qmgrs/FMCQM/errors\nb) /var/mqm/qmgrs/@SYSTEM/errors\nc) /var/mqm/errors \n\nIt is also recommended to check the db2diag.log file, which can be found in /home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2dump.\n\nAlso check the information provided by WebSphere MQ Workflow in /var/fmc/cfgs/FMC/log: There are the files fmcerr.log and fmcsys.log.",

Make sure the object directories have a group profile assigned with proper authority. Then, make sure that the end user is a member of the appropriate group profile. \n\n \nIf these steps do not fix the problem, please contact IBM Support at 1-800-IBM-SERV to open a PMR and we will be glad to assist you further. \n\n\nStay Informed by Receiving Product and Lifecycle Notifications:\nClick here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674106]",

The import will work if the snapshot being imported\n   does not already exist and only if the user has write permission\n   to that toolkit.\n   \n   However, if the user does not have write permissions to that\n   toolkit, the import of the process application will fail\n   entirely and the user will get \"You are not authorized to change\n   this workspace\" error.  However, the error does not give any\n   information to the user which toolkit the error is related to.\n   The user gets confused as even he has all the permissions\n   for the process application, he still gets the error.  User gets\n   this error will have a very hard time figuring out the issue is\n   with the toolkit and what needs to be done to fix the problem.\n   \n   \n   2) Improvement Proposal:\n   \n   The error message should include the toolkit name with which the\n   user does not have permission to write to.  For instance, the\n   error can ay something like  \"You must have write\n   permnission to import a snapshot \"xyz\" to toolkit \"abc\" that\n   already exists in your workspace. Add write permission to\n   this user for this toolkit.\"  A useful error message should help\n   user nail down the exact problem and how to resolve it himself\n   so that PMR can be avoided.\n   \n   (The customer opened this PMR complained that the error was not\n   helpful and I do agree with that as it took me a while to\n   figure out what the problem was for him.)\n   \n   3)  PMRs and customers affected:\n   \n   PMR 27505,499,000  (Fidelity Management)\n   I also found some people asking about this error on public\n   sites.\n   \n   4) Severity/Prioritization details\n   4A) Frequency (how often does it occur, number of customers hit)\n   I only handled one PMR by far.\n   \n   4B) Benefit /Impact (how much time will improvement save, will\n   it prevent critical sits)\n   Yes, definitely.

SQLSTATE=57019\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe problem is caused by a timing issue. There is a design limitation with quiesced databases being activated by users without quiesce_connect (QUIESCECONNECTAUTH) privileges. \nYou must start the database in order to check the database authorizations in the catalogs. \nOnce the database is activated and authorizations are checked, the user fails to advance (fails with -20157) and the database is brought back down. \n\nWhen the user connection goes through FirstConnect to connect to the database and it does not have the proper authorization to connect to a quiesced database, the backup agent attempts to connect. It receives -1035 because the offline backup requires an exclusive connection. This behavior is expected given the design limitation. \n\nWhen you have users trying to connect in a loop, the timing issue is exposed. If there was no connection attempt, the backup would be successful. \n\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou would see messages similar to the following in your db2diag.log at the time offline backup failed: \n\n\nA user (DB2XXXX) that does not have QUIESCECONNECTAUTH privilege activates the database with FirstConnect:\n\n2013-04-12-12.50.09.001201+120 E232186A506 LEVEL: Event\nPID : 21364974 TID : 4885 PROC : db2sysc 0\nINSTANCE: db2inst1 NODE : 000 DB : DBXX\nAPPHDL : 0-234 APPID: 10.123.123.13.12345\nAUTHID : DB2XXXX HOSTNAME: host1\nEDUID : 4885 EDUNAME: db2agent (DBC2) 0\nFUNCTION: DB2 UDB, base sys utilities, sqeLocalDatabase::FirstConnect, probe:1000\nSTART : DATABASE: DBC2 : ACTIVATED: NO\n\nDB2INST1 fails to do the backup:\n\n2013-04-12-12.50.09.412200+120 I232693A623 LEVEL: Error\nPID : 21364974 TID : 6455 PROC : db2sysc 0\nINSTANCE: db2inst1 NODE : 000 DB : DBXX\nAPPHDL : 0-242 APPID: *LOCAL.db2inst1\nAUTHID : DB2INST1 HOSTNAME: host1\nEDUID : 6455 EDUNAME: db2agent (DBC2) 0\nFUNCTION: DB2 UDB, base sys utilities, sqeLocalDatabase::SubsequentConnect, probe:9782\nMESSAGE : ZRC=0xFFFFFBF5=-1035\nSQL1035N The operation failed because the specified database cannot\nbe connected to in the mode requested.\n\nUser DB2XXXX receives -20157 and the database is deactivated again:\n\n2013-04-12-12.50.10.865760+120 I235107A893 LEVEL: Error\nPID : 21364974 TID : 4885 PROC : db2sysc 0\nINSTANCE: db2inst1 NODE : 000 DB : DBXX\nAPPHDL : 0-234 APPID: 10.123.123.13.12345\nAUTHID : DB2XXXX HOSTNAME: host1\nEDUID : 4885 EDUNAME: db2agent (DBC2) 0\nFUNCTION: DB2 UDB, relation data serv, sqlrr_appl_init, probe:180\nDATA #1 : SQLCA, PD_DB2_TYPE_SQLCA, 136 bytes\nsqlcaid : SQLCA sqlcabc: 136 sqlcode: -20157 sqlerrml: 27\nsqlerrmc: DB2XXXX QUIESCE DATABASE\nsqlerrp : SQLRR003\nsqlerrd : (1) 0x801A006D (2) 0x00000000 (3) 0x00000000\n(4) 0x00000000 (5) 0xFFFFFE70 (6) 0x00000000\nsqlwarn : (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\n(7) (8) (9) (10) (11)\nsqlstate:\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issue can be addressed by using the \"restricted access\" option in the QUIESCE INSTANCE command. This allows you to do an offline backup by quiesce the instance in restricted access mode, instead of quiescing the database individually. You can also start the DB2 instance in restricted access mode, with the db2start admin mode restricted access command. \nThese two methods are the recommended ways to quiesce the database before taking offline backups. \n\nThe following is an example of this method: \n\ndb2 quiesce instance <inst_name> restricted access immediate force connections\ndb2 deactivate db <dbname>\ndb2 backup db <dbname>\ndb2 activate db <dbname>\ndb2 unquiesce instance <inst_name>\n\nIf you have many databases in your instance and you only want to do an offline backup of one database while the others remain online, you can see to use an alias for the applications connecting to the database. Before the backup, uncatalog that alias and catalog it in the database again with that alias after the offline backup is complete.",

      "backup; pack; archive; size; save offline and delete; soad; Distributed Change Management; DCM; clean cache; clean_cache; collapse; ccm collapse TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do you manage the size of your database in IBM Rational Synergy? \n\nCAUSE\nAs development work progresses the number of objects you manage in your Rational Synergy database increases and this in turn increases the size of your database in the file system and Relational Database Management System(RDBMS) and it increases the size of you backup files and the length of time it takes to backup and restore your database. Backing up the databases is discussed in TechNote 1325161: How to backup very large Rational Synergy databases. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21325161] Managing the size of the database is part of this process.\nWhat does a database consist of?\n\nA Rational Synergy database consists of two parts; The file system and the metadata.. The biggest part is the file system. This contains all the source files managed by the database and are in the form of cache files and archive files. The metadata is the part of the data stored in the RDBMS and consists of the attribute names, tasks objects, problem objects, type definitions, baselines, the relationships between objects and many other data elements used to define the data. Managing the size of the database requires you to manage both parts of the database.\n\nWhy do databases grow?\n\nDatabases grow over time due to a number of factors. As new versions of objects are created, those versions consume space in the database. Additionally, personal build products (executables and libraries) consume significant space. While this space is necessary during active development of a release, once that software has been released and begins to age, there is less and less chance that it will ever be referenced \n\nagain. \n\n \n\nAnother contributing factor to the size of a database is the size of the cache area. Like most modern software systems, Rational Synergy maintains a cache of frequently referenced information. Like all caches, the Rational Synergy cache must be maintained, and while this maintenance is necessary, it is not automated. Clearing items from the cache that have not been referenced in a given period of time can drastically reduce the size of a Rational Synergy database, and the corresponding size of the repository backup. \n\n \n\nAs Rational Synergy code bases grow, the databases can become more cumbersome. Backups take longer. Day-to-day performance may degrade. Version histories may get so long that they are impractical to view. \n\n \n\nThe remedy for these conditions is some database maintenance. Regularly scheduled clean up of cache files, removal of unused intermediate versions, management and housekeeping of developer workspaces and off-loading data to another repository. When these steps are followed, most Synergy repositories will stay within a manageable size with adequate performance. \n\n \n\nThis TechNote presents recommendations based on average usage of Rational Synergy. These recommendations may be inadequate for a particular installation, or may be contrary to policy at your location. To schedule an analysis of the specific needs of your organization and the best way \n\naddress those needs, you should engage IBM Field Services or contact Rational Client Support\n\n\n\nANSWER\nThere is no single solution to managing the size of the database. There are a number of different steps you can do which will all contribute something to the total solution. \n\n * Save Offline And Delete(SOAD) \n * Collapsing object versions \n * Housekeeping \n * Clean Cache \n * Clean Up \n * Rational Synergy Distributed / Distributed Change Management (DCM) files\n\n\n \n\n * Save Offline And Delete(SOAD) SOAD is a methodology of identifying unwanted data, saving this data to an offline repository and deleting it from the active database. The process is designed so this offline data can be restored without loss. See Removing unwanted data [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_remove_unwant_data.html] for details on this methodology and the relevant commands.\n   \n   See also Removing unnecessary baselines [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.manage.doc/topics/s_t_bmg_remove_unnecessary_bls.html] using the SOAD methodology.\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\n * Collapsing object versions\n   Collapsing object versions is a method for removing intermediate versions of objects. When versions are collapsed, they are physically deleted from the repository, and the history links updated to reflect the removed objects.\n   \n   Note: The ccm collapse command is not available from release 7.2. Use the SOAD methodology described above.  \n   \n   As an example, consider the following history diagram: \n   \n   \n   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618321&amp;aid=1]\n   \n   In this diagram, Version 1 was in Release 1. Versions 2 and 3 are in no release. They\u2019re also one release back, so the likelihood of them being used drops significantly. Following a collapse, the history tree diagram would look like: \n   \n   \n   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618321&amp;aid=2]\n   \n   In a practical sense, the code base is unchanged, as it\u2019s unlikely anyone would ever begin development from version 2 or 3 that were not in a release. This is especially true for individual developers personal use build products. For very active modules, and very large modules, this operation can reduce the storage requirements of a Rational Synergy repository. \n   \n    \n   \n   To collapse object versions use the ccm collapse command. See Deleting obsolete product files [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_delete_obsolete_prodfile.html] for more information on using this command.\n   \n   \n   \n   \n * Housekeeping\n   Most human activities generate some amount of refuse as a by-product, so does software development. To keep from drowning, some housekeeping is necessary, and it just happens to help with the overall problem of the growth of our repository. Just like you would clean up after a guest leaves, throwing away their paper plate and cup, you must clean up after developers who have left, throwing away their working projects, products, versions and tasks. \n   When the developers leave \n   \n   Keep track of the users defined in your system and the users actually on the project. When they leave the company, remove their userid and role definitions from the Rational Synergy database. This helps to ensure you\u2019re really getting rid of them, and keeps them out of your code base should they find their way back into your network. After you\u2019ve removed them from the users list, query for all of their working projects, turn off the workarea for each project, and non-recursively collapse them. This doesn\u2019t free up much space in the database, but may free up some on the desktop. Query for all their working build products, and collapse them. This will help reduce the database space utilization. Maybe not much, maybe a lot, depending on how many developers you remove at any one time and how big their products are. If they\u2019re working in Powerbuilder, for example, where the .pbl files can be extremely large, this step alone may net you hundreds of megabytes. Source code and tasks require a bit more thought than products and projects. Working source code can either be deleted or rejected, but rejecting the working objects without removing them from the repository is more in line with the library functionality expected of Configuration Management and is therefore recommended. Tasks still need to get done even after someone leaves, so they\u2019re typically re-assigned to another developer. See TechNote 1419794: How to change the ownership of the object to a new user ID [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419794] \n   \n   \n   The Save Offline and Delete (SOAD) tool provides a scope for this purpose called \"All non-static projects and products for a specified user\" \n   \n    \n   \n   \n   When releases die \n   \n   A similar set of steps should be done when releases are made inactive. The system should be queried for all non-static projects and products for inactive releases, and these should be collapsed. Any static projects for inactive releases that are not in the released state and are not used as baselines for further development should also be collapsed. Working source should rejected as above. Tasks will need to be reviewed carefully to see if they must be re-assigned or rejected. \n   \n    \n   \n   When releases are completed or abandoned, mark them as inactive. You can delete old baselines and old prep hierarchies using the following SOAD scopes: \n   \n    *   * Non released baselines for specified release older than specified date \n       * Integration Testing prep projects and products for a specified release\n      \n      \n   \n   \n   See also Removing unnecessary baselines [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.manage.doc/topics/s_t_bmg_remove_unnecessary_bls.html].\n   \n   \n * Clean Cache\n\n\n * \n * \n *  \n * Architecture Overview \n * In order to be efficient in it\u2019s use of space, Rational Synergy does not keep the full text of every source file. Instead, it keeps only the deltas, or changes, to a source file (assuming an ascii file, binaries are stored in a compressed format). These deltas are maintained using an industry standard reverse delta engine. The deltas, or archives, are stored in an archive area of the database. When a particular version is needed, the deltas are applied to the most recent version to get the contents back to where they were at a \n * particular version. There is a significant time penalty for extracting back versions from the archive, so once a version has been extracted, it is kept in the cache in its full form. Since many of these old versions may never be referenced again, the full text copy may be removed from the cache. If it is ever referenced again, the system will automatically extract it from the archive, recreating the cached version. For more details of the architecture, see TechNote 1325187: Structure of the Rational Synergy Cache and Archive [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21325187] \n *  \n * Cleaning the cache. \n * Cache clean-up is performed using the clean_cache command. Using this command can drastically reduce the size of a database and it\u2019s associated backup file. The default behavior of the clean_cache command is the best practice, and it will remove from the cache any file that is greater than 14 days old and not used in a project. Should you want greater control over the contents of the cache, clean_cache can be adjusted to delete files either that are older or newer, or only specific types of files. See Cleaning objects from the database cache [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_clean_objs_dbcache.html] for more detailed information. \n * Strategies \n * One strategy is to add a clean_cache command with no arguments (default behavior) to your nightly database check and backup script, right after the backup. This will ensure that the cache remains clean while minimizing the effects on the database at any given time. \n *  \n * Should there be issues with the archive, the cached copy of the source will be captured in the immediately preceding backup where it can be restored if necessary. \n *  \n * Before you clean your cache files you must ensure that your archive files are correct. You can do this using the ccm fs_check command. For more details see: \n *   *   *   *   *  ccm fs_check [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_r_ag_ccm_fs_check_w.html] for windows ccm fs_check [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_r_ag_ccm_fs_check_i.html] for UNIX/Informix ccm fs_check [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_r_ag_ccm_fs_check_o.html] for UNIX/Oracle \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   \n   \n * \n * Clean Up\n   Use the clean_up command to delete unused automatic tasks or to delete process rules from your database. See the online-help for details.\n   \n   Note: The ccm clean_up command is not available from release 7.2. Use the SOAD methodology described above.\n   \n   \n * Rational Synergy Distributed / Distributed Change Management (DCM) files As part of the DCM methodology files are transferred from one database to another in the form of a transfer package. These files are often stored on the file system as part of the database. The existence of these files does not affect the performance of Rational Synergy but they do affect the size of the database and the backup. \n   \n   You need to review the files in the <database path>/dcm for the generate, receive and log directories/folders to see if they are still required. The DCM administrator is possibly the best person to manage these files. See Administrating Rational Synergy Distributed [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_c_dcm_admin_ratlsyn_distr.html] for more information.\n   \n   \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Monitoring Database Space [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_monitor_dbspace.html]\nRemoving Unwanted data [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_remove_unwant_data.html]\nReducing database size [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/synhelp/v7m2r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.synergy.admin.doc/topics/s_t_ag_reduce_db_size.html]\nPDF: CLI commands for 7.1 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rsdp/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.help.download.synergy.doc/pdf71/help_cli.pdf]",

This bulletin also addresses FREAK: \u201cFactoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys\" SSL/TLS vulnerability and RC4 Bar Mitzvah Attack for SSL/TLS vulnerability. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nCVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]\nDESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as \"Bar Mitzvah Attack\".\nCVSS Base Score: 5\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]\nDESCRIPTION: Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.\nCVSS Base Score: 5\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]\nDESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]\nDESCRIPTION:A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers.

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What is the procedure to physically move a server with Information Server installed to a new location if the ip address of the server will change in the new location? \n\nANSWER\nAs long as the hostname has not changed and the Domain Name Server (DNS) servers and the system's /etc/hosts file resolve the hostname to the new IP address you should not have to do anything else when moving the server. Before moving look in the Version.xml file and confirm how the hostnames were referenced in the PersistedVariable section. If hostname resolution was working at the time of install you should not see any IP addresses in that file.

If the document has just one part, then it will be downloaded as is, instead of as a compressed zip file. If there are multiple parts, then all the parts are downloaded as a single zip file. This action is available for use with documents containing multiple parts.\nA document part refers to the logical entity that stores the contents of the document. A document can have more than one type of content, say text, image etc. Each of those content elements can be put into a document part. Thus a document is a collection of one or more document parts.\n\nNote that neither action downloads the annotations created on the document.

Did not attempt to re-connect to avoid user account lockout\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTurn off the internal DSM Invalid Credential flag: \n\n- Edit the database configuration, and change the userid/password to a wrong userid/password. Click OK to save the configuration. \n- Edit the database configuration again, and change to the correct userid/password. Click on Test Connection, and click OK to save the configuration. \nThat would reset the internal flag, and DSM should be able to connect to the database again. \n\nAnother option is to use the upddbcredential script under <DSM_install>/dsutil/bin directory. The instructions on how to use the script is available in the README.txt file, located under the same <DSM_install>/dsutil/bin directory\n\n\n\nIf you are using DSM V2.1, the new property DS_DBCONN_TRACE has been added to capture additional tracing information to help you investigate the root cause of the problem.\nIf you add this property in the dswebserver.properties file and set to true, for example:\nDS_DBCONN_TRACE=true\nthe debug statement will show up in <DSM install>/logs/dsserver.0.log file.\nRestart DSM after the change.\nWrite down the time that you turned on the property, and the time that you start to see the Invalid Credential error messages.\n\nWhen you see the Invalid Credential problem, search for the following string in the dsserver.0.log file:\n\n--- Database Connection failed for DB Profile =\n\nThe string will tell you which profile connection failed, what is the error code, and if it is an invalid credential issue, then it displays the userid and password.\nIf you don't want the userid/password information explicit in the log files, make sure that you remove the property from dswebserver.properties file, remove the old log files, and restart DSM.\n\nThis property won't fix anything.

How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Linux/Windows - Thanks for the memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/]\nAIX - Thanks for the Memory [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-aix/]\nIntroducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf]\nCompressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]\nIBM Java Compressed References and Native OOMs [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/kevgrig/entry/ibm_java_compressed_references_and_native_ooms]"

To carry the action outside of the User Defined Function to the Policy level one would have to set a variable that is then tested immediately after the User Defined Function call - for example: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * SetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\", 1);\n * \n * Exit();\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * SetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\", 1);\n * \n * Exit();\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * If(GetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\") == 1)\n * \n * {\n   Log(ID+WP+\": Existing policy...\");\n   \n * Exit\n * ();\n   }\n\n\nThe above example ties in somewhat with the exampled configuration from the TechNote \"Event Flagging with Go_NoGo checking\" [ link below] and uses structured logging as covered in the TechNote \"Structured logging in Policies\" [ link below]. \n\nIf the User Defined Function was nested within another User Defined Function one would have to exit each layer to return the Policy layer before the Exit() action would exit the Policy. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Event Flagging with Go_NoGo checking [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675015]\nStructured Logging in Policies [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21596180]"

This leads to events being reprocessed multiple times even when event flag fields are employed to prevent event recapture once it has been processed.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nEvent flagging (please see the TechNote \"Event flagging\" [link below]) is useful for preventing multiple recapture of events (please see the TechNote \"Avoiding unwanted event reprocessing\" [link below]), but if multiple recapturing of the event occurs before the event is even processed for the first time the chance for multiple reprocessing remains.\n\n\nOne part of the solution is to use a flag field value to indicate that the event has started to undergo processing without having to wait for the entire Policy process to complete. But still there is the potential for copies of the events to exist in the EventReader EventQueue. One can deal with these with the UpdateEventQueue() Policy function - please see the TechNote \"Removing duplicate event records from EventQueue with UpdateEventQueue\" [link below].\n\nHowever, there is a further situation where the copy of the event has moved on to the EventProcessor EventQueue and is outside the scope of the UpdateEventQueue() Policy function. This is addressed by ensuring the EventReader processes duplicate events in a single thread manner through using EventLocking against a unique field (for example: Identifier - please see the TechNote \"Using EventLocking to help prevent multiple event reprocessing\" [link below]) and configure the Policy to check the flag field value of the actual event in the ObjectServer and determine if processing should continue or not. For example:\n\n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Log(ID+WP+\": !!! Event already processed - exiting !!!\"); \n   Exit(); \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * WP = \"MarkEventImpacting\"; \n   Log(2,ID+WP); \n   @ImpactFlag = 2; \n   Log(3,ID+WP+\": @ImpactFlag: \"+ @ImpactFlag); \n   ReturnEvent(EventContainer); \n   ...  * main portion of the Policy\n   \n   ... \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Log(ID+WP+\": !!! Event GoNoGo.ImpactFlag value: \"+ GoNoGo[0].ImpactFlag +\" not within expected range- exiting !!!\"); \n   Exit(); \n * \n\n\nThe above can be greatly reduced by removing extraneous logging and declaring parameters directly within the action functions. Please note that, if one were to set this up as a user defined (or custom) function, the Exit() action would only exit the user defined function and not the Policy process. To address this one would set a variable in the user defined function to indicate that the Policy process is to exit and then test this variable upon return to the Policy and act appropriately.

      "netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; activate; action; function; exit; use; usage; apply; chain; policy; ipl; language TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Considerations when applying the Activate() function \n\nANSWER\nThe Activate() action function is a useful tool for moving the processing of an event from one Policy to another and providing the latter Policy with the updates and additions to the context performed in the former Policy. Here are a few notes on how the Activate() action function operates and considerations in applying it.\nThe Activate() action function uses the syntax:\n\n\n\n * \n\n\nWhere [DataItem] is a row of data acquire by a GetBy*() action function against the internal DataType \"Policy\", this acquired (usually by name) row being the Policy to be activated. The majority of situations now require a NULL value for this parameter as the preference is generally to activate the Policy by name. This parameter is mostly a legacy section of code from before the addition of the PolicyName feature. \nWhere [PolicyName] is the name (string) of the Policy to trigger. This parameter would require a NULL value if you are activating the policy by DataItem. \n\nThe subsequent Policy then launched acquires the context from the original Policy including all updates to the EventContainer and additional variables. \n\nUpon completion of the subsequent Policy, the Activate() action function returns the context (including all updates to the EventContainer and additional variables) back to the same point (immediately after the Activate()) in the original Policy, which is then processed to conclusion. \n\nIf one has the need to configure a return to the original Policy before the conclusion of the subsequent Policy; one can employ the Exit() parser function - please see TechNote \"Exit() action within User Defined Function in Impact Policy Language\" [ link below]. This will exit the immediate scope of the process and return to the same point (immediately after the Activate()) in the original Policy with the context including all updates to the EventContainer and additional variables acquired in the subsequent Policy. \n\nWhere one employs a chain of Activate() action functions across multiple Policies each Policy in turn has to complete (or exit) before the context is returned to its predecessor for it to conclude. \n\nIn situations where the values acquired within former Policies are required within latter Policies, but do not determine which Policies are to be run, the use of EventReader Policy Chaining might be more appropriate - please see the TechNote \"Policy Chaining usage\" [ link below]. Please note that in Policy Chaining the determination of which Policies to run against the event is made at the time the event is initially captured. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Exit() action within User Defined Function in Impact Po [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675316]\nPolicy Chaining usage [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623713]",

And Function Library Policies are intended to also provide a single point of maintenance for complex Policy routines that are called from multiple Policies. They are a compromise between efficiency of maintenance and efficiency of processing. Calling a UDF is less efficient than employing a simple \"fall through\" style Policy script and multiple recursive function calls can significantly dig into the stack. \n\nA bit of history:\n\nWhen Impact moved from version 2 to 3 the Policy design moved from being a graphical flowchart \"Action Node Tree\" (.ant) to the current script style \"Impact Policy Language\" (.ipl) and Impact 3 offered an upgrade tool that converted .ant to .ipl. The trouble was that this performed a rather simplistic, best-effort conversion whereby each Action Node in the Impact 2 Policy was made into a UDF in Impact 3 and the branches between Action Nodes became function calls.\n\nShortly after Impact 3 was released there were a large number of cases where Impact 3 experienced stack overflow and memory issues. This was found to be due to the very large number of UDFs inherently created by the Impact 3 upgrade tool in the migrated Policies and recursive function calls from these dug into the stack so much as to cause ImpactServer crashes. Getting the message out that the upgrade tool was only a first step in converting the Impact 2 Policies took quite a while and this issue was still common up until Impact 5.\n\nRecently there seems to be an increase in the number of Policies being written in a C language style: declaring variables, defining functions and then running the main portion of the Policy as a series of function calls. This TechNote is an attempt to get the message back out there that this is not the most efficient method. Designing a \"fall through\" style Policy script is much more efficient and one should only use UDFs where one can show significant maintenance efficiency for a complex Policy routine that is called multiple times."

      "TCR - Tivoli Common Reporting TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to increase Java heap memory size in IBM Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) 2.1/2.1.1 versions? \n\nCAUSE\nRunning a large scale report with Default java heap settings might result in OutOfMemory error\n\nANSWER\nTCR 2.1/2.1.1 server provides a default setting for heap size, a minimum size (xms) of 512MB and a maximum size (xmx) of 1024MB. \n\nIn order to change the heap memory size, execute the following command:\n<INST>/tipv2/bin/wsadmin.sh[.bat] -user <USERNAME> -password <PASSWORD> -f <INST>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/changeMem.py --xms <MINVALUE> --xmx <MAXVALUE>\n\nwhere <INST> is the TCR Installation folder like /opt/IBM/tivoli\n<MINVALUE> can be 1024 and <MAXVALUE> can be 1843 (1GB and 1.8GB respectively)\n\nNOTE: In order to avoid OutOfMemory error, it is recommended to be within the 2GB limit (for 32 bit architectures - maximum memory can be 2^32)\nFor 64-bit JVM, the maximum heap value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory. Reason being maximum memory will be 2^64 which is 16 exabytes which is a very huge number! \n1 exabyte = 1024*1024*1024 Gigabyte!\nPlease refer to the links provided in the 'Related Infomation' section to learn more on the Java sizing and heap information.\n\nTo test the JVM's maximum heap memory support, please follow the below test:\na) Open command line / shell script and navigate to <INST>/tipv2/java/jre/bin folder\nb) Execute this command: java -Xmx1843m hello\n- if java accepts this 1.8GB setting, then it will throw the \"class not found\" error for hello\n- if java does not accept this value, then it gives the \"Initialization error\" and \"Failed to instantiate heap\" message!\n- You can try to increase the value of Xmx and see where it breaks\n- For 32-bit JVM, it is not advised to set this value beyond 1843m but for 64-bit JVM, value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory.\n\nAfter setting the new values, restart the TCR server for the changes to take effect.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Sizing the Java Heap [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/tools/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.doc.igaa%2F_1vg000139b8b453-11951f1e7ff-8000_1001.html]\nJava code to Java Heap [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-codetoheap/index.html]"

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Reports appear to take a long time to run and then eventually result in the RSV-SRV-0056 error message. The environment does not appear to properly start-up and will often slow or stop after attempting to start the logging service.\n\nInteractive reports run fine, batch reports end with the error RSV-SRV-0056. The environment does not appear to properly start-up but cogservice starts fine.\n\nSometimes there are also issues starting IBM Cognos 8 service from within Cognos Configuration. \n\nSYMPTOM\nRSV-SRV-0056 The Report Server process did not initialize properly.\nRSV-SRV-0042 Trace back: \n\nRSReportService.cpp(792)\nRSReportService.cpp(454) \n\n\nCAUSE\nTwo known causes:\n1.) Invalid statement/arguement/line within the ipfclientconfig.xml file causing the services to never fully or properly load. \n2.) Batchreportservice uses the nc_tables which cannot be accessed because of bad performance of the database, in this case a DB2 \n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTwo known diagnosing hints: \n\n1.) Review the /cognos/c8/configuration directory for the existence of the ipfclientconfig.xml file and it's date time stamp to see if it is recent.\nAttempt to load the ipfclientconfig.xml in a web browser, such as Internet Explorer, to see if it loads correctly. If there are any errors with the syntax/structure of the file it will not load.\n2.) Review the DB2 log for errors, verify the value for setting APPLHEAPSIZE\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTwo options to resolve this issue: \n\n1.) \n\n * Remove / rename the ipclientconfig.xml. \n * Update the ipfclientconig.xml so it contains proper syntax if you require the file for tracing. \n * Restart service after completing the above.\n\n2.) Increase the parameter APPLHEAPSIZE to at least 4096 or even higher if needed.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Analytics Cognos Business Intelligence Cognos Viewer AIX, HP-UX, HP Itanium, Linux, Solaris, Windows 8.4, 8.4.1",

IBM Cognos PowerPlay Web is out of memory. Try to simplify your request. Please try again or contact your administrator.\"\nor in a large environment with many users :\na lot of \"Powerplay Server is busy\" messages on the client side because at some point the whole server is busy with many large requests , even with a high value of \"Maximum processes\" and \"Queued request timeout\". \n\nCAUSE\nIn most cases, performance problems come from nesting several levels from distinct dimensions, or levels with a high number of categories.\nFor example, users may attempt to list all products bought by each client. To do this, they insert as rows the lowest level of the Client dimension, and then nest the level Products to the right of clients.\n\nIf the cube contains 2000 clients and 500 products, the result is a one million-row report containing many irrelevant rows. Users apply \"zero suppression\" to keep the report details that are actually needed.\n\nSuch reports can be very time-consuming, and may sometimes never terminate. Even rendering a million lines of static HTML, with no back-end processing, will take a lot of time to complete.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo avoid these \"cross-products\", the PowerPlay Transformer model can be modified by adding a new dimension called \"Products by client\" that is formed with the two levels that the users need to nest. \n\n\nUsing this new hybrid dimension can result in a significant, and even outstanding, improvement.\n\nDimensions \"Products\" and \"Clients\" are just basic samples to illustrate the issue ; this can be applied to many kinds of dimensions.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Analytics PowerPlayClient PowerPlayClient Business Analytics Cognos Series 7 PowerPlay Enterprise Server Business Analytics Cognos Series 7 Upfront \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 1027661",

      "TCR - Tivoli Common Reporting TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to increase Java heap memory size in IBM Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) 2.1/2.1.1 versions? \n\nCAUSE\nRunning a large scale report with Default java heap settings might result in OutOfMemory error\n\nANSWER\nTCR 2.1/2.1.1 server provides a default setting for heap size, a minimum size (xms) of 512MB and a maximum size (xmx) of 1024MB. \n\nIn order to change the heap memory size, execute the following command:\n<INST>/tipv2/bin/wsadmin.sh[.bat] -user <USERNAME> -password <PASSWORD> -f <INST>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/changeMem.py --xms <MINVALUE> --xmx <MAXVALUE>\n\nwhere <INST> is the TCR Installation folder like /opt/IBM/tivoli\n<MINVALUE> can be 1024 and <MAXVALUE> can be 1843 (1GB and 1.8GB respectively)\n\nNOTE: In order to avoid OutOfMemory error, it is recommended to be within the 2GB limit (for 32 bit architectures - maximum memory can be 2^32)\nFor 64-bit JVM, the maximum heap value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory. Reason being maximum memory will be 2^64 which is 16 exabytes which is a very huge number! \n1 exabyte = 1024*1024*1024 Gigabyte!\nPlease refer to the links provided in the 'Related Infomation' section to learn more on the Java sizing and heap information.\n\nTo test the JVM's maximum heap memory support, please follow the below test:\na) Open command line / shell script and navigate to <INST>/tipv2/java/jre/bin folder\nb) Execute this command: java -Xmx1843m hello\n- if java accepts this 1.8GB setting, then it will throw the \"class not found\" error for hello\n- if java does not accept this value, then it gives the \"Initialization error\" and \"Failed to instantiate heap\" message!\n- You can try to increase the value of Xmx and see where it breaks\n- For 32-bit JVM, it is not advised to set this value beyond 1843m but for 64-bit JVM, value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory.\n\nAfter setting the new values, restart the TCR server for the changes to take effect.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Sizing the Java Heap [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/tools/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.doc.igaa%2F_1vg000139b8b453-11951f1e7ff-8000_1001.html]\nJava code to Java Heap [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-codetoheap/index.html]"

An XML Firewall service does not have this option available by default. Therefore, to have a service send redirects to a client, you can configure your WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance as described below: \n\n \n\n 1.  Create an XML Firewall. \n 2.  Create a policy and configure your request rule. \n 3.  Create a new rule which is an error rule. \n 4.  This rule contains a match, a transformation, and a result action. \n     It should look like this: \n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=1]\n     \n 5.   \n 6.  The XSL transform is where you set the HTTP response code to 302 or 307 and the \"Location\" to where you want to redirect the request. \n 7.  The XSL file should look like this. Modify the Location, http://myDomain.de/test, if you want to use this example. \n     \n     <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n     <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" \n     xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\" xmlns:dp=\"http://www.datapower.com/extensions\" \n     xmlns:dpconfig=\"http://www.datapower.com/param/config\" \n     extension-element-prefixes=\"dp\" \n     exclude-result-prefixes=\"dp dpconfig\">\n     <xsl:output method=\"xml\" indent=\"yes\"/>\n     <xsl:param name=\"dpconfig:redirectBadInput\" select=\"'http://myDomain.de/test'\"/>\n     <xsl:template match=\"/\">\n     <xsl:message>\n     <xsl:text>*** Redirect to custom error page: </xsl:text>\n     <xsl:value-of select=\"$dpconfig:redirectBadInput\"/>\n     <xsl:text>*** Done </xsl:text>\n     </xsl:message>\n     <dp:set-http-response-header name=\"'x-dp-response-code'\" value=\"'302 redirected'\"/> \n     <dp:set-http-response-header name=\"'Location'\" value=\"$dpconfig:redirectBadInput\"/>\n     </xsl:template>\n     </xsl:stylesheet></code>]\n     \n     \n 8.  Save this rule and configuration. \n 9.  Now go back to the request rule configured in step 2. \n 10. In front of an action which may cause an error to occur, in this case a transformation, place an advanced action. \n 11. Configure this advanced action to be an on-error action and press Next.\n     \n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&aid=2]\n     \n 12. Define the Error Mode to be \"continue\" and select the created error rule as Processing Rule (in this case FW_rule_1). \n     \n     \n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286764&amp;aid=3] \n 13.

      "IMF50; IMF60; WL60; WL61; WL62 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n DataPower Gateway Appliance is a security & integration gateway appliance, built for simplified deployment & hardened security, bridging multiple protocols & performing conversions at wire speed. IBM Worklight provides a powerful mobile application development platform for the enterprise. This article demonstrates how DataPower can be used in the DMZ of your enterprise to protect Worklight mobile application traffic. \n\nCONTENT\nIntroduction \n\nAs you mobile-enable your enterprise, there are several aspects of security to consider. When protecting mobile application traffic that is coming from your customer and employee devices into your network you want to protect the traffic from being altered, authenticate these users, and authorize their access to applications. In this article we showcase how to leverage the security gateway features of DataPower to protect mobile application traffic initiated by a client Worklight application.\n\n\nPatterns for Integration\n\nEnterprise topologies generally include designating different zones of protection so that specific processing can be secured and optimized. There are several ways DataPower can be leveraged in the DMZ and in other zones within your network to protect enterprise resources. As you start to build out Worklight applications to be delivered to the devices of your customers and employees these methods can be applied to mobile traffic. Here are some key methods observed: \n\n * DMZ\n *  Reverse Proxy Pattern - DataPower as a front-end Reverse Proxy and Security Gateway for your mobile applications built with and deployed on a Worklight Server REST Service Fa\u00e7ade Pattern - DataPower protecting REST endpoints in the DMZ without utilizing Worklight adaptors for integration. \n * \n * Intranet\n *  Mediation Pattern - DataPower providing protocol and message transformation and security for enterprise services that are integrated via Worklight adapters and enabling connectivity to your existing SOA infrastructure. Federated SSO with Authorization Pattern - DataPower to authorize authenticated access to OAuth protected resources \n\nThis article will focus on the Reverse Proxy Pattern. Subsequent articles will highlight and elaborate on these and other patterns as they emerge. \n\n\nThe Setup \n\nIn the following sections you will learn how to setup and use DataPower Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) service to proxy and secure access to Worklight mobile applications. We are going to demonstrate using either HTTP basic authentication or HTTP form based login between the mobile client and DataPower. DataPower will authenticate the user and generate a LTPA SSO token to be used for the back-end WebSphere Application Server. See Figure 1. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=1]\nFigure 1 : DataPower will authenticate the user and protect the communication to the Worklight Server\n\nThe following diagram shows a typical interaction between the user/application and the server.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&amp;aid=2]\n\nIn order to establish this pattern it is recommended you follow these steps: \n\n 1. Install and configure a Worklight environment and test the install with a simple application without DataPower acting as the reverse proxy to make sure your application logic works. \n 2. Configure a MPGW on DataPower to proxy the mobile application (or the Worklight console). The configuration of the gateway for these two patterns is described below.  * Utilize Basic Authentication for end user authentication with AAA, and generate Single Signed On (SSO) LTPA token for Worklight Server, running on WebSphere Application Server if user has successfully authenticated. \n     * Utilize HTML Form Based Login with AAA, and generate Single Signed On (SSO) LTPA token for Worklight Server, running on WebSphere Application Server if user has successfully authenticated.\n    \n    \n 3. Testing with a reverse proxy will involve the following.  * Updating the Worklight configuration on the server with the reverse proxy configuration (see below) \n     * Update the mobile application mobile security test configuration to use form based authentication , which means the application requires to authenticate immediately upon startup. Either HTTP Basic Authentication or HTML Form Based Login is supported before the application starts. For web widgets, widget resources are only accessible to the browser after user has successfully authenticated.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWorklight Specific Configuration Setup \n\nThis section assumes you already have installed Worklight Studio and your stand-alone server environment on Liberty or WebSphere Application Server. \n\nAdding the reverse proxy involves taking actions on each of the applications you are configuring. You need to modify the authenticationConfig.xml on the server to include the WASLTPAofRealm, login module, and security test. Use the WASLTPA realm to indicate that all the of applications within this realm will use LTPA tokens for their SSO and it would be configured like the following: \n\n<securityTests>  * \n * <testDeviceId provisioningType=\"none\"/> \n   <testUser realm=\"WASLTPARealm\"/> \n * \n * \n * \n * <testUser realm=\"WASLTPARealm\"/> \n * \n\n</securityTests> \n\n<realms>  * \n * \n * \n * <className>com.worklight.core.auth.ext.WebSphereFormBasedAuthenticator</className> \n   <parameter name=\"login-page\" value=\"/login.html\"/> \n   <parameter name=\"error-page\" value=\"/loginError.html\"/> \n * \n\n</realms> \n\n<loginModules>  * \n * \n * \n * <className>com.worklight.core.auth.ext.WebSphereLoginModule</className> \n * \n\n</loginModules> \n\nNote: This file is typically available at <WAS_INSTALL_DIR>/profiles/<WAS_PROFILE>/installedApps/<WAS_CELL>/IBM_Worklight_Console.ear/worklight.war/WEB-INF/classes/conf. \n\nYou will need to restart the Worklight console enterprise application after you make this change. \n\n\nClient Mobile Application Update \n\nIn your client mobile application, add the following JavaScript to your HTML Worklight application. See the attached sample for the exact location and the JavaScript (JS) file. \n\nfunction showLoginScreen() {  * \n\n} \n\nfunction showMainScreen() {  * \n * \n * \n\n} \n\nvar myChallengeHandler = WL.Client.createChallengeHandler(\"WASLTPARealm\"); \nvar lastRequestURL; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.isCustomResponse = function(response) { \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * return true; \n * \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * lastRequestURL = response.request.url; \n   return true; \n * \n\n * \n * worklight\n * \n * \n * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.handleChallenge = function(response) {  * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.handleFailure = function(response) {  * \n\n}; \n\nmyChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback = function(response) {  * \n * \n * \n * myChallengeHandler.handleChallenge(response); \n * \n * \n * \n * //hide the login screen, we are logged in \n   showMainScreen(); \n   myChallengeHandler.submitSuccess(); \n * \n\n}; \n\n//When the login button is pressed, submit a login form \n$(\"#loginButton\").click(function(){  * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * j_username: $(\"#username\").val(), \n   j_password: $(\"#password\").val(), \n   originalUrl : lastRequestURL, \n   login: \"Login\" \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * myChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback); \n\n}); \n\nIf you want to retrieve the LTPA key file used for authentication from the Worklight Server, you can also use the WL.Client.Login Worklight API function.  * \n\n\nThis call will trigger the myChallengeHandler.isCustomResponse method with a JSON response, where you can retrieve the LTPA key file.  * \n * response.responseJSON.WASLTPARealm.isUserAuthenticated) \n * \n\n\nFor any subsequent Adapter calls that need to be proxied through the reverse proxy, you can include this sessionKey as a header within the request. \n\nEnsure your HTML body for the Worklight application reflects the login information that DataPower will handle. The Worklight documentation and samples explain the use of authentication and customizing authentication (20-22). \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=3] \nIt can be as simple as the following: \n\n<div id= \"authPage\">  * \n * \n * \n * \"loginForm\"\n * \n *  Username:<br/> \n   <input type= \"text\" id= \"username\" autocorrect= \"off\" autocapitalize= \"off\"  * \n    * \"admin\"\n    * \n   \n   Password:<br/> \n   <input type= \"password\" id= \"password\" autocorrect= \"off\" autocapitalize= \"off\"  * \n    * \"admin\"\n    * \n   \n   <input type= \"button\" id= \"loginButton\" value= \"Login\" /> \n * \n\n</div> \n\n<div id= \"index\">  * \n\n</div> \n\n\nApplication-descriptor.xml \n\nThe Worklight documentation covers how to create both the client side app and the server side configuration files. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=4] \n\nIn order to have the authentication test added to an application or device, add a securityTest attribute to the environment's tag in the application-descriptor.xml in your project to use the WASTest-securityTest security test we created earlier in our authenticationConfig.xml on the server-side. Here is an iPad example: \n\n<ipad bundleId= \"com.Datapower\" securityTest= \"WASTest-securityTest\" version= \"1.0\">  * \n * \"true\"\n * \n * \n * \n * <encryptWebResources enabled= \"false\"/> \n   <testWebResourcesChecksum enabled= \"false\"  * \n    * \"png, jpg, jpeg, gif, mp4, mp3\"\n    * \n   \n   \n * \n\n</ipad> \n\nFor an iPhone example, your application descriptor may look like the following. \n\n<iphone bundleId= \"com.myappId\" version= \"1.3.3\" securityTest= \"WASTest-securityTest \">  * \n * \"true\"\n * \n * \n * \n * <encryptWebResources enabled= \"false\"/> \n   <testWebResourcesChecksum enabled= \"false\" ignoreFileExtensions= \"png, jpg, jpeg, gif, mp4, mp3\"/> \n * \n\n</iphone> \n\n\nDefine a MPGW on DataPower \n\nConfiguring a MPGW to terminate the secure network connection and enforce the authentication of an application as defined above follows the same steps. The steps and illustrations represent a subset of the configuration screens found in the DataPower GUI that are necessary to configure the MPGW for a mobile application. To configure the proxy we will need to configure the front-side and the back-end URL. \n\nStart with the General Configuration tab (See Figure 2). The items to be selected are indicated in the illustration below with blue arrows and include:  * Multi-Protocol Gateway Name: provide a name for your gateway \n * Set Response Type: Non-XML\n   This allows http Web application traffic, include JSON, JavaScript, CSS to pass through the appliance. \n * Set Request Type: Non-XML\n   This allows http web application request to be handled by appliance \n * Front Side Protocol: For the type of use case we describe we use an HTTPS handler. For this style of interaction the user credential will be passed between the client and server, so the transport should be protected using SSL protocol. \n * Multi-Protocol Gateway Policy: The Policy tab allows for additional configuration, and in this case we select '+' to add a new policy, which will contain the AAA policy. (This depends on the authentication method used. See section 3.a and 3.b for detail information on how to configure the appropriate policy.) \n * Backend URL: Specify the address and port of the Worklight server hosted on a WebSphere Application Server. (Given the credential, LTPA will be sent to the back-end, consider to use a SSL port, for this article, we will use an HTTP port.)\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=5] \n\nWhen creating a HTTPS front-side handler there are additional parameters to configure(see Figure 2.a and 2.b)  * Name: Provide a name for the handler (HTTPS) \n * Port Number: Choose an available port \n * Allowed Methods and Versions: Enable 'Get Method'\n   This enables support for HTTP Get. \n * SSL Proxy: Specify a SSL Reverse Proxy profile\n   This provides the identity for the SSL Server.\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&amp;aid=6] \nFigure 2.a : Select HTTPS(SSL) Front Side Handler\n\n\u2026... \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=7] \nFigure 2.b Configure HTTPS Front Side Handler\n\nThe next step is to configure the Policies that you want to be applied to the traffic. Select the \u201cGeneral\u201d Tab \u2192 Multi-Protocol Gateway Policy (by clicking '+'). In the policy section we need to configure a set of rules to be applied based on what actions the reverse proxy needs to enforce. DataPower allows the administrator to configure a policy, name it and then reuse it. This policy will handle both mobile web and mobile application traffic. \n\nHere we give two options. Option 1 is HTTP Basic Authentication. Option 2 is for forms based authentication. \n\nOption 1: Utilize HTTP Basic Authentication (see Figure 4) \n * Policy Name: Enter a policy name (\u201cworklight-basicauth\u201d), click \u201cApply Policy\u201d \n * Click \u201cNew Rule\u201d: (repeat this for 4 rules below, from top to bottom on Figure 4) \n * Rule 1 \u2013 When processing HTML content we want to skip processing with the icon associated with web site or web page (worklight-basicauth_rule_0)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d or \u201cBoth Directions\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = /favicon.ico \n    * Advanced: \u201cSet Variable\u201d \u2192 var://service/mpgw/skip-backside = 1 \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 2 \u2013 Since the policy will be applied to each request, the order of the rules needs to ensure that we first Verify a LTPA Token if it exists in the HTTPrequest (worklight-basicauth_rule_3). If there is no token, we then move to the next rule and authenticate the user (rule 3)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = http, HTTP Header Tag = Cookie, HTTP Value Match=*LTPAToken* \n    * AAA: VerifyLTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 3 \u2013 Handle the authentication of end user if LTPA Token does not exist (worklight-basicauth_rule_1)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = * \n    * AAA: BasicAuth2LTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 4 - Handle both the redirect and content-type reset (potentially), on the response side (worklight-basicauth_rule_2)  * Direction: \u201cServer to Client\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = * \n    * Filter: provides a custom style sheet which handles redirect and content-type rewrite (a sample style sheet, redirect.xsl, is provided with this article) redirect.xsl [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=9]redirect.xsl [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=8]\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n      \n   \n   \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038292&aid=10] \nFigure 4: MPGW Style Policy for HTTP Basic Authentication Support \n\n\nOption 2: Utilize HTTP Form Based Login (see Figure 5) \n * Policy Name: Enter a policy name, (\u201cmpgw-form\u201d) click \u201cApply Policy\u201d \n * Click \u201cNew Rule\u201d: (repeat this for 5 rules below, from top to bottom on Figure 5) \n * Rule 1 \u2013 skip processing with the icon associated with web site or web page (mpgw-form_rule_0)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d or \u201cBoth Directions\u201d \n    * Match: type = url, match pattern = /favicon.ico \n    * Advanced: \u201cSet Variable\u201d \u2192 var://service/mpgw/skip-backside = 1 \n    * Result \n   \n   \n * Rule 2 - Verify a LTPA Token if it exists in the http request (mpgw-form_rule_1)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: type = http, HTTP Header Tag = Cookie, HTTP Value Match=*LTPAToken* \n    * AAA: VerifyLTPA (See AAA section below on how to configure this)\n      Output: NULL \n    * Result\n   \n   \n * Rule 3 - Generate the HTML Form Login Page (mpgw-form_rule_2)  * Direction: \u201cClient to Server\u201d \n    * Match: Match with PCRE = on, \n      type = url, match pattern = /(Login|Error)Page\\.htm(l)?(\\?originalUrl=.*)? \n    * Transform: provides a custom style sheet which builds either a Login or Error html page.

In a future article we will explore configuring other authentication and authorization use cases as well as explore the use of DataPower as a REST gateway and DataPower performing ESB security and protocol mediation. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n See this content also in IBM Worklight Foundation V6.2.

      "F5; WebSphere Edge; BIG-IP; response; 301; 302; redirect TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM\nAccessing WebSphere Portal through certain proxies (or gateways) may result in incorrect location fields in 301 and 302 response headers. The proxy (or gateway) fails to rewrite the response header. The client cannot follow the 301 or 302 redirect.\n\nSYMPTOM\nThis technote addresses the following scenarios: \n\n1. You access WebSphere Portal via a proxy and navigate through the site. In response to some request, WebSphere Portal returns a 301 or 302 redirect with a location field like: \n\n \n\nhttp://proxy.ibm.com:10040/wps/... \n\n \n\nwhere 10040 is WebSphere Portal's internal port. Since the proxy is not listening on this port, when the browser tries to follow the redirect, the request fails. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. You access WebSphere Portal via an HTTPS proxy and navigate through the site. In response to some request, WebSphere Portal returns a 301 or 302 redirect with a location field like: \n\n \n\nhttp://proxy.ibm.com:80/wps/... \n\n \n\nSince the HTTPS proxy services requests on port 443 only, when the browser tries to follow the redirect, the request fails.\n\n\nCAUSE\nA proxy fails to rewrite the location field in the response header before redirecting the client. \n\n \n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) RFC 2616 specifies that the location field should be an absolute URI. WebSphere Portal uses getScheme(), getServerName(), and getServerPort(), as defined by the Java Servlet Specification, in constructing URLs to set in location fields. WebSphere Application Server (WAS) services getServerPort() according to its web server plug-in's AppServerPortPreference. \n\n \n\nThis approach assumes: \n\nA. Any non-direct requests must be made through a supported web server running the WAS plug-in. \n\nB. If WebSphere Portal is configured for HTTPS, the SSL pipe should terminate at a supported web server running the WAS plug-in.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nInspect the HTTP headers for requests and responses using a tool like Fiddler. If 301 or 302 redirects' location fields are unreachable, map the network to determine what proxies stand between the browser and WebSphere Portal. \n\n \n\nEnabling WebSphere Portal engine and WebSphere Application Server security and webcontainer traces may help you identify how the location field is constructed by providing the server's perspective (e.g. doGet request/response, getServerPort() call, HTTP header information): \n\n\ncom.ibm.wps.engine.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.security.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.webcontainer.*=all:\ncom.ibm.ws.wswebcontainer.*=all\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nEnsure that the assumptions A and B above have been met. If these conditions cannot be met, additional proxy rules may be required to route requests correctly. \n\n\nWork with proxy administrators to ensure that the proxy rewrites response headers' location fields, as needed, before forwarding 301 or 302 redirects.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n AppServerPortPreference (WAS) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/fep/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/uwsv_plugin_props1.html]\nIETF RFC 2616 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt]\nJava Servlet 2.4 Specification [http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr154/index.html]\nConfiguring SSL (6.1 InfoCenter) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v615/security/ssl_intro.html]\nConfiguring SSL (7.0 InfoCenter) [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_SSL_wp7]\nSupported web servers [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg27007791]\nFiddler [http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/]",

For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x. In Rational Application Developer 8.0.3+ be aware of the Info Center topic: Creating profiles for WebSphere Application Server on a 64-bit machine [Creating%20profiles%20for%20WebSphere%20Application%20Server%20on%20a%2064-bit%20machine] and see this APAR opened against RAD 8.5.1/8.5.5 : PI06339: A 64-bit install of the WebSphere Application Server Profile Management Tool may not launch on Windows 7.

For open source or third party plugins, you need to contact the provider for assistance. For more general Eclipse plugin support details, refer to:\nRational Application Developer Support for third party and open-source Eclipse plugins and tools [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600040] \n\nM2Eclipse/M2E (Maven Integration for Eclipse) is shipped and supported with RAD 8.5.1 or higher. More on this later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of RAD v7.5.x or v8.0.x (both are end of service), it may be possible to use a third party (open source) Maven, even if it is not supported by RAD. \n\nAs an example, sonatype.org used to provide M2Eclipse ( Maven Integration for Eclipse ), a Maven implementation for Eclipse. The provider of m2eclipse or any other Maven plugin/implementation is responsible for any how-to, defect or install support (if any is available). \n\nNote: In 2010, Sonatype announced that this project would be donated and incubated at Eclipse with a new name m2eclipse [http://eclipse.org/m2e/] , as per per: https://support.sonatype.com/entries/24316542-Where-did-http-m2eclipse-sonatype-org-sites-m2e-go- [https://support.sonatype.com/entries/24316542-Where-did-http-m2eclipse-sonatype-org-sites-m2e-go-] \nAs a historical example, the longer available sonatype M2Eclipse \"Installation Requirements\" document showed this excerpt:  * \n   \"... - Rational Application Developer (RAD) or Rational Software Architect (RSA) 7.5 is a commercial product from IBM and is based on eclipse 3.4 (unsupported) \n   \n    \n   \n   ! If you are using RAD/RSA 7.5, install the \"Graphical Editing Framework Zest Visualization Toolkit\" under the most recent version of \"GEF SDK\" using the update site http://download.eclipse.org/tools/gef/updates/releases/before you install m2eclipse.\n   ..\"\n   \n   \n   \n\n\nThe only exception to the provider being responsible, may be if the core Eclipse, J2EE/Java EE/WTP Tools or other tools provided in Rational Application Developer can be shown to be the cause of the problem. \n\n\n\n\n[http://wiki.eclipse.org/GEF_Zest_Visualization] \nGEF Zest Visualization [http://wiki.eclipse.org/GEF_Zest_Visualization] is not provided or supported with Rational Application Developer v7.x or v8.x. It should not be confused with the Graphical Editing Framework GEF (org.eclipse.gef) plugin, which is provided. The vendor (provider) should be contacted for assistance. Rational Application Developer is only responsible for any suspected problems or defects that can be demonstrated as caused by the Eclipse or other tools that are shipped, and is not responsible for any Maven implementation, how-to or install assistance. \n\n\n\nJava EE Development using Rational Application Developer 7.5.5 or 8.0.x with Maven: \n\nThe following developerWorks article on best practices using Maven in Rational Application Developer v7.5 (also applicable to v8), is useful and is provided as-is: \n\nRational Application Developer Wiki [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Rational%20Application%20Developer%20Wiki]:\nJava EE Development using Rational Application Developer 7.5.5 and Maven [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/ajax/download/24e17223-2791-4e0f-8727-6be80aa46762/4a26f5ff-828c-4780-ba26-5d8e3f144ea6/RAD_755_MAVEN_0601.pdf] (pdf) \n\nThe article shows, for example, that for a dynamic web project in Rational Application Developer v7.5.5.x with Maven, is quite reasonable to have a Maven like structure specified in the dynamic web application create wizard (or as defaults in the workspace: Preferences > Java EE > Project): \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Output Folder: \n   src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes \n * Content Directory: \n   src/main/webapp \n\n\n\nNaturally, src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib contains jars. The article discusses much more, and is provided as is.  \n\nThe following developerWorks article on using Maven Integration (m2e) - m2eclipse [http://eclipse.org/m2e/] with Rational Application Developer 8.0.3+ is a follow-on to the above article. It has been revised and enhanced in v8.0.4. It is useful and is provided as is:\n\nRational Application Developer and M2Eclipse [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/113607155/RAD_m2e-Nov.pdf?version=1] (pdf)\n\nSimilar to the previous article, Maven, the m2eclipse feature, and its extended connectors (including m2e-wtp) are not supported by IBM Rational Application Developer 8.0.x. The IBM developerWorks Rational forum: \"Development Tools (RAD, RSA, RDA, RSM, RWD) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=430&cat=24]\", maybe another source of useful information on this topic. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nM2Eclipse/M2E (Maven Integration for Eclipse) with RAD 8.5.1 or higher:\n\n\nM2Eclipse/M2E (Maven Integration for Eclipse) is shipped and supported with RAD 8.5.1 or higher.\nRAD only supports M2E as shipped and installed with the product. The Maven feature is not installed by default. It is necessary to select this feature when installing RAD 8.5.1 or higher using IBM Installation Manager (IM) or after the install using IM > Modify. If you have installed RAD 8.5.0, use IM > Update to get the latest fixpack 8.5.5.x and select the Maven feature\n\nMaven/M2E setup and usage is documented in RAD v8.5.1 Knowledge Center topic:\nDeveloping Maven projects [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/radhelp/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.maven.doc%2Ftopics%2Fmaven_intro.html].\nNote: This RAD 8.5.1 topic was incomplete, at the time of this technote.

      "Spring; RAD; support; RSA; third party; plugins; eclipse; springsource TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What tooling support is provided for using Spring within IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) or IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere (RSA) v7x/8x? What level of support is there for Spring usage in general? \n\nCAUSE\nThere have been incidents involving the use of the Spring Framework/IDE after its installation in a Spring project giving the error: \n\n\"... \n\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Initializing Spring UAA\"... \n\n... \n\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org/osgi/framework/Bundle.getVersion()Lorg/osgi/framework/Version; \n\n at org.springframework.ide.eclipse.internal.uaa.UaaManager$ProductDescriptor.buildProduct(Unknown Source) \n\n at ... \n\n...\"\n\n\n\nANSWER\nThe Spring framework or Spring tools and plugins do not ship with any RAD v7.0, 7.5 or 8.0 release and is not documented in any RAD 7x/8.x Information Center as supported. Likewise, there is no support provided for any third party plugins or tools. \n\n \nIf a third party or open source Spring Framework plugin is compatible with, for example, Eclipse 3.2 (in the case of RAD 7.0), then you should be able to install and use it (as in the provider's instructions). Similarly, RAD 7.5.x is based on Eclipse 3.4.x and RAD 8.0.x is based on Eclipse 3.6.x. The provider should be contacted for any support or help, apart from basic Eclipse/RAD questions. \n\nIf there is a problem installing the Spring Framework plugin in a RAD version, and it can be shown to install in a similar release and update of a stand-alone Eclipse, then RAD Support could look into this from the perspective of supporting Eclipse in RAD.\n\nFor more general eclipse plugin support details, refer to :\nRational Application Developer Support for third party and open-source Eclipse plugins and tools [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600040]\n\nNote-Tip: There have been incidents involving the use of the Spring Framework/IDE after its installation in a Spring project giving the error:\n\"... \n\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Initializing Spring UAA\"... \n\n... \n\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org/osgi/framework/Bundle.getVersion()Lorg/osgi/framework/Version; \n\n at org.springframework.ide.eclipse.internal.uaa.UaaManager$ProductDescriptor.buildProduct(Unknown Source) \n\n at ... \n\n...\" \n\nA similar error was reported in the context of RAD and stand-alone Eclipse, similar to this non-IBM Spring forum item:\n- errors after installing SpringSource Tool Suite 2.7.1 on eclipse 3.6 [http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?113618-errors-after-installing-SpringSource-Tool-Suite-2-7-1-on-eclipse-3-6]\n\nThe solution in this case was to do an Update of the associated Eclipse packages and restart Eclipse or RAD with the -clean option, because the original install may not have refreshed completely. Sometimes restarting Eclipse/RAD is sufficient. Regardless, making use of third party or open source support resources similar to the above forum example is advised.\n\nIt is also recommended to be at the latest maintenance update of any RAD v7.0.0.x, v7.5.5.x, 8.0.4.x, or 8.5.x which would have the latest Eclipse updates, as listed in this Recommended Fixes document:\n- Updates to Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007823]\n\nNote:\nThe Rational Application Developer Wiki [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/rad/Home] on developerWorks has this article\n- Tooling support in Rational Application Developer v 7.5.x for Spring Applications [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/113607155/SpringApplications.pdf?version=1]\nIt is provided \"as is\" and is not supported by IBM Rational Application Developer.\n\n\nWebSphere Application Server support for Spring runtime:\nAt publication time of this technote, IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6x, 7x, or 8x articles like\n- The Spring Framework and IBM WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0706_johnsonbuck/0706_johnsonbuck.html]\nshould not be considered a statement of what is supported. Contact IBM WAS Support for more information.\n\nSimilarly, for example, the WAS 7 Information Center items\n\n- Spring Applications [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.express.doc%2Finfo%2Fexp%2Fae%2Fwelc6tech_spring_intro.html]\nand\n- Spring Framework [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.express.doc%2Finfo%2Fexp%2Fae%2Fcspr_intro.html]\n\n\n * \n * \n * Spring Framework\n * \n * \n * There are some best practices to develop Spring Framework applications that can run successfully in a WebSphere\u00ae Application Server environment.\n * \n * \n * The Spring Framework is an open source project that provides a framework for simple Java objects that enables them to use the Java EE container through wrapper classes and XML configuration.\n * \n * \n * You can use the Spring Framework with WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0.2 and later, but some supported features require a specific release of the product. When this situation applies, it is stated in the relevant topic.\n * \n * \n * For WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0, you must use Spring Framework Version 2.5.5 or later.\n * \n * \n\n\ndo not imply that Spring itself is directly supported in WAS v7. WAS versions 6, 7, and 8 do not support Spring itself, and they do not provide the Spring framework. You must engage the Spring provider for assistance with Spring. \n\nThe Spring Framework is not officially supported by IBM WAS Support, as of the publication time of this technote. IBM WAS Support may help with issues like configuration of Spring within an EAR/application, while anything related to specific issues within Spring or configuration details that require internal knowledge of how it works is out of their scope of support. For example, they may review any classloader or transaction handling related issue specific to any application running in WAS. \n\nThe Spring Framework and applications using it are limited as per any EAR application, in that the WAS support of Spring is similar to other external technologies. They allow customers to bring their own versions of third party jar or runtimes in most cases (for example, some customers provide their own commons-logging or JPA provider). Contact IBM Support for WebSphere to inquire about any changes in this regard. \n\nSpring and RAD SCA Tooling: \nRegarding the Spring Tutorial Viewlet [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/140051369/spring_tutorial.swf?version=1] on the RAD Wiki, RAD versions 7.5.x and 8.0.x support the tools for configuring Spring applications into SCA components. IBM Rational Application Developer does not support Spring.

However, RAD does not provide direct support for either. \n\n\nConclusion: \nThere is currently no RAD tooling support for creating Spring applications or using Spring. \nSimilarly, WAS does not officially support the Spring runtime framework, but allows its use similar to allowing other source JPA runtime implementation in a JEE application. In the case of Spring they also have made their WAS 7 runtime more accommodating of the Spring runtime. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Maven and M2Eclipse support in RAD v7.x and v8.x [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500446]",
      "rsa; installed; version; imcl; installed.xml; listInstalledPackages; parse TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do you find out which version of IBM Rational Software Architect for Websphere Software (RSA4WS), IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA) or IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) is installed on a machine? \n\nCAUSE\nYou are administering a large number of machines and you want to be able to make sure that the same version of RSA4WS, RSA or RAD is installed on a given set of machines.\n\nANSWER\nANSWER\n\n\nThere are two ways for you to check which versions of RSA4WS, RSA or RAD is installed on your machine depending on your version of IBM Installation Manager (IM): \n\n \n\n * Use the imcl command (This is the recommended method but it requires IM version 1.4.3 or higher.) The easiest way for you to find out which versions of RSA4WS, RSA or RAD is installed is to use the imcl command that was introduced with IM 1.4.3. You can find theimcl executable file in the tools directory of your IM installation directory. By default, this directory can be found in C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\Installation Manager\\eclipse\\tools on Microsoft Windows or in /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools on Linux. \n   \n   From this directory, you can run the following command to have a list of all installed packages: \n   \n   imcl listInstalledPackages (or imcl.exe listInstalledPackages on Windows.) \n   \n   This command will return a list of all packages installed on your machine, among which you will find the installed versions of RSA4WS, RSA or RAD, if any. For instance, if you have installed RSA4WS 8.0.4.2 on your machine, you should see the following line:\n   \n   com.ibm.rational.rsa4ws.80_8.0.4020.RSA4WSO8042-I20121203_2132 \n   \n   Additionally, starting with version 1.5 of IM, you can add the -verbose option that will more explicitly state the name and version of the installed packages and make it easier for you to find your version. For instance, if you have RSA4WS 8.0.4.2 installed on your machine, you should see the following lines: \n   \n   \n   [Package] \n   \n   Name: IBM? Rational? Software Architect for WebSphere Software (com.ibm.rational.rsa4ws.80) \n   \n   Version: 8.0.4.2 (8.0.4020.RSA4WSO8042-I20121203_2132 \n   \n   For RSA or RAD the process is the same, except for the name of the packages.\n   \n   \n\nWith early releases of RSA and RSA4WS v8.0.x, versions 1.4.1 or 1.4.2 of IM, which did not come with theimcl command, were supported for installation. If you or any of your users are using these versions, you will have to make sure that every IM version that is installed is upgraded to at least version 1.4.3. \n\nIf upgrading IM on all the machines you are administering is not possible, you will have to write a small program that mimics what the imcl does, namely parsing the installed.xml file to find out which version of RSA is installed. \n\n \n\n * Parse theinstalled.xml file (This method is more complex, but it does not require any specific version of IM.) The installed.xml file is a file used by IM to maintain a list of all packages and features that are currently installed on your machine. This file can be found in IM installation directory. By default, this directory is located in C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\Installation Manager\\eclipse\\tools on Windows or in /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools on Linux \n   \n   \n   Within this file, assuming that you have RSA4WS 8.0.4.2 installed, you should notably have a <package> tag which looks like: \n   \n   \n   <package kind='offering' name='IBM\u00ae Rational\u00ae Software Architect for WebSphere Software' id='com.ibm.rational.rsa4ws.80' version='8.0.4020.RSA4WSO8042-I20121203_2132'>\n   \n   and contains, among many others, <property> tags similar to the following \n   \n   \n   <property name='cic.info.name' value='IBM\u00ae Rational\u00ae Software Architect for WebSphere Software'/> \n   \n   <property name='cic.info.version' value='8.0.4.2'/>\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   You would then need to write a script that that parses the XML file and looks for its property cic.info.version for each package named IBM\u00ae Rational\u00ae Software Architect for WebSphere Software. \n   \n   \n   You could then display the full name (using the cic.info.name value) of each RSA4WS instance installed on the machine and its exact version. \n   \n   If you also have versions of RSA or of RAD, the process would be the same, but the name of the package to look for would be different.\n   \n   \n\n\nNote that if you have several versions of the same product installed on your machine, both methods will enable you to find all installed versions. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Command-line arguments for imcl [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r4/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.cic.commandline.doc%2Ftopics%2Fr_tools_imcl.html]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Software Development Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software Installation Linux, Windows 8.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2, 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.4.1, 8.0.4.2, 8.5, 8.5.1 Software Development Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software Installation Linux, Windows 8.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2, 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.4.1, 8.0.4.2, 8.5, 8.5.1",

Perform the Pre-upgrade Tasks in the Planning tab. Ensure you have a current database backup. \n    \n    Note: If using an ACIF user exit, it must be recompiled after upgrading to V9.0.0 to utilize the current version of ICU and new OnDemand server installation directory.\n    \n    \n 2. Download the required target OnDemand server software.  1. Download the V9.0.0.0 full install package [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033331]. \n     2. Download your target V9.0.0.X fixpack. For example, V9.0.0.1.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n 3. Stop your OnDemand library and object server.\n    \n    \n 4. Upgrade the OnDemand server software on your library and object server. The fixpack is an executable installer. For example, to install the fixpack via command line on Linux and Unix, run odaix.bin -i console. On Unix and Linux, this step must be performed as root. On Windows, use the account OnDemand server runs under.  1. Run the V9.0.0.0 installer. \n     2. Run your desired target V9.0.0.X fixpack installer. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 5. Alter the OnDemand database for use with V9.0.0 and later by running the following commands on your library server. These commands must be run as the OnDemand instance owner specified in the OnDemand Configurator on Windows or the ars.ini on all other platforms.  1. Mandatory. Alter the OnDemand database for V9.0.0 and later:\n        \n        arsdb -I instance_name-uv\n        \n        \n     2. Mandatory if you have Report Distribution installed and V9.0.0.1 or later. Run this command to correct Report Distribution folder field to application group field mappings:\n        \n        arssyscr -I instance_name-r\n        \n        \n     3. Optional, but recommended. Update the System Log and System Load application groups and folders to support new style dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036188]. \n        \n        Important: Once this is performed, older clients (prior to V9.0.0) will not be able to query the System Log or System Load folders.\n        \n        Note: When the System Log and System Load application groups are updated, the current table will be closed and a new one will be opened once a new message or load is generated. \n        \n         1. Update the System Log application group and folder:\n            \n            arssyscr -I instance_name-l -u\n            \n            \n         2. Update the System Load application group and folder:\n            \n            arssyscr -I instance_name-a -u\n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 6. Update the indexes for the OnDemand system tables. Run these arsdb commands to drop and recreate the indexes for these tables:\n     1. Drop the indexes:\n        \n        arsdb -I instance_name-efv\n        \n        \n     2. Create the new indexes:\n        \n        arsdb -I instance_name-rfv\n        \n        \n     3. Reorg and update statistics on all the OnDemand system tables:\n        \n        arsdb -I instance_name-mv\n        \n        If using Oracle\u00ae, run the following command instead:\n        \n        arsdb -I instance_name-sv\n        \n        \n    \n    \n 7. Verify the appropriate ulimit settings are in place for the OnDemand instance owner. Since the OnDemand server is a 64-bit process, the soft and hard limits for the user running the server process should be set to unlimited for data (-d), memory (-m), and stack (-s).\n    \n    \n 8. Start your OnDemand library and object server.\n    \n\n\nHow to Uninstall OnDemand Server V9.0.0 \n\n\n\nTo uninstall OnDemand server V9.0.0:  * On Linux: /opt/ibm/ondemand/V9.0/_uninst900/uninstallod -i console \n * On Windows: Use Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel \n * All other platforms: /opt/IBM/ondemand/V9.0/_uninst900/uninstallod -i console\n\n\nTo uninstall Global Security Kit Crypt V8 and Global Security Kit SSL V8, refer to the OnDemand README file. \n\nMiscellaneous \n\n\n\n * To upgrade to OnDemand server V9.0.0, the full install package must be downloaded from IBM Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/]. \n * On Windows, instructions to migrate to 64-bit DB2 are here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.upgrade.doc/doc/t0011000.html] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r5/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.migration.doc/doc/t0011000.html]. \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Best practices: Using Full Text Search with CMOD [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=129&uid=swg21606305]\nEnhancement Retention Management Guide [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024000&aid=1]\nCMOD V9.0.0 Publication Library [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022033]\nCMOD V9 New Date Types [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036188]\nCMOD V9 Installation Considerations [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608635]",

Migrate the OnDemand Report Distribution Facility (RDF) definitions to the new OnDemand Distribution Facility (ODF) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042292]. This step should only be performed if you have the OnDemand Report Distribution Facility installed. \n     \n     Note: RDF has been deprecated and replaced with ODF. Although it has been deprecated, RDF is still provided in V9.5 in order for customers to transition to ODF. You can continue to run RDF, however it will no longer exist in any future release of OnDemand, therefore customers are expected to migrate as soon as possible to ODF.\n      1. Create the ODF tables and definitions:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-Ortv\n         \n         \n      2. Convert and export the RDF definitions to XML files:\n          1. On AIX\u00ae and Solaris\u00ae:\n             \n             export CLASSPATH=/opt/IBM/ondemand/V9.5/jar/rdf2odf.jar:${CLASSPATH}\n             \n             \n          2. On Linux and Linux for System z:\n             \n             export CLASSPATH=/opt/ibm/ondemand/V9.5/jar/rdf2odf.jar:${CLASSPATH}\n             \n             \n          3. On Windows\u00ae:\n             \n             set CLASSPATH=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\OnDemand\\V9.5\\jar\\rdf2odf.jar;%CLASSPATH%\n             \n             \n          4. Using Java 1.7, run the migration utility to export your RDF definitions:\n             \n             java com.ibm.cm.od.rdf2odf.MigrateRDF -h source_cmod_hostname -p port -e db_engine -i source_db_name -d output_directory\n             \n             Note: Run the command with no parameters for the full command syntax and options.\n             \n             \n         \n         \n      3. Import the XML file contents to your OnDemand instance. Take the four files (odfRecipients.xml, odfRecipientsLists.xml, odfReportIDs.xml, and odfDistributions.xml) created in the output directory and use the ARSXML command to import your new ODF definitions:\n          *  arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfRecipients.xml arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfRecipientsLists.xml arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfReportIDs.xml arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfDistributions.xml\n            \n            \n         \n         \n     \n     \n 9.  Verify the appropriate ulimit settings are in place for the OnDemand instance owner. Since the OnDemand server is a 64-bit process, the soft and hard limits for the user running the server process should be set to unlimited for data (-d), memory (-m), and stack (-s).\n     \n     \n 10. Start your OnDemand library and object server.\n     \n     \n 11. Optional. Uninstall your OnDemand V9.0 software. By default, OnDemand V9.5 will be installed to a different directory than V9.0 and does not automatically uninstall OnDemand V9.0.\n\n\n\nUpgrading from V8.5.0.X \n\n\n\n 1.  Perform the Pre-upgrade Tasks in the Planning tab. Ensure you have a current database backup. \n     \n     Note: The OnDemand server install now also contains and installs the Content Manager OnDemand Web Enablement Kit (ODWEK).\n     \n     Note: The OnDemand server does not support OnDemand Clients (e.g. Windows Client, ODWEK, CICS, etc.) prior to V8.5.\n     \n     Note: If using an ACIF user exit, it must be recompiled after upgrading to V9.5.0 to utilize the current version of ICU and new OnDemand server installation directory.\n     \n     \n 2.  Download the required OnDemand server software.  1. Download the V9.5.0.0 full install package from IBM Passport Advantage. \n      2. Download your target V9.5.0.X fixpack. For example, V9.5.0.1. \n      3. If you have OnDemand Report Distribution installed:  1. Download the V9.0.0.0 full install package [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033331]. \n          2. Download the V9.0.0.1 fixpack.\n             \n             \n         \n         \n     \n     \n 3.  Stop your OnDemand library and object server.\n     \n     \n 4.  Upgrade the OnDemand server software on your library and object server. The fixpack is an executable installer. For example, to install the fixpack via command line on Linux and Unix, run odaix.bin -i console. On Unix and Linux, this step must be performed as root. On Windows, use the account OnDemand server runs under.  1. If you have OnDemand Report Distribution installed:  1. Run the V9.0.0.0 installer. \n          2. Run the V9.0.0.1 installer. \n          3. Run this command to correct Report Distribution folder field to application group field mappings:\n             \n             arssyscr -I instance_name-r\n             \n             \n          4. Uninstall V9.0.0.1.\n             \n         \n         \n      2. Run the V9.5.0.0 installer. \n      3. Run your desired target V9.5.0.X fixpack installer. \n         \n         \n     \n     \n 5.  On Linux and Unix platforms, update the IBM Global Security Kit Crypt and IBM Global Security Kit SSL software for OnDemand V9.5. A newer version is included and required by OnDemand V9.5.  1. Uninstall your current Global Security Kit Crypt and IBM Global Security Kit software. Refer to the product README for platform specific uninstallation steps. \n      2. Install the updated Global Security Kit Crypt and IBM Global Security Kit software. Refer to the product README for platform specific installation steps.\n         \n         \n     \n     \n 6.  Restore your OnDemand server configuration files (ars.ini, ars.cfg, ars.cache, ars.dbfs, arsload.cfg) and custom user exits to your OnDemand V9.5 directories.\n     \n     \n 7.  Alter the OnDemand database for use with V9.5.0 by running the following commands on your library server as the OnDemand instance owner specified in the OnDemand Configurator on Windows or the ars.ini on all other platforms.  1. Mandatory. Drop the OnDemand system table indexes:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-efv\n         \n         \n      2. Mandatory. Alter the OnDemand database:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-uv\n         \n         \n      3. Mandatory. Recreate the OnDemand system table indexes:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-rfv\n         \n         \n      4. Mandatory. Reorg and update statistics on all the OnDemand system tables:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-mv\n         \n         If using Oracle\u00ae, run the following command instead:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-sv\n         \n         \n      5. Optional, but recommended. Update the System Log and System Load application groups and folders to support new style dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036188]. \n         \n         Important: Once this is performed, older clients (prior to V9.0.0) will not be able to query the System Log or System Load folders.\n         \n         Note: When the System Log and System Load application groups are updated, the current table will be closed and a new one will be opened once a new message or load is generated. \n         \n          1. Update the System Log application group and folder:\n             \n             arssyscr -I instance_name-l -u\n             \n             \n          2. Update the System Load application group and folder:\n             \n             arssyscr -I instance_name-a -u\n             \n             \n         \n         \n     \n     \n 8.  Migrate the OnDemand Report Distribution Facility (RDF) definitions to the new OnDemand Distribution Facility (ODF) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042292]. This step should only be performed if you have the OnDemand Report Distribution Facility installed. \n     \n     Note: RDF has been deprecated and replaced with ODF. Although it has been deprecated, RDF is still provided in V9.5 in order for customers to transition to ODF. You can continue to run RDF, however it will no longer exist in any future release of OnDemand, therefore customers are expected to migrate as soon as possible to ODF.\n      1. Create the ODF tables and definitions:\n         \n         arsdb -I instance_name-Ortv\n         \n         \n      2. Convert and export the RDF definitions to XML files:\n          1. On AIX and Solaris:\n             \n             export CLASSPATH=/opt/IBM/ondemand/V9.5/jar/rdf2odf.jar:${CLASSPATH}\n             \n             \n          2. On Linux and Linux for System z:\n             \n             export CLASSPATH=/opt/ibm/ondemand/V9.5/jar/rdf2odf.jar:${CLASSPATH}\n             \n             \n          3. On Windows:\n             \n             set CLASSPATH=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\OnDemand\\V9.5\\jar\\rdf2odf.jar;%CLASSPATH%\n             \n             \n          4. Using Java 1.7, run the migration utility to export your RDF definitions:\n             \n             java com.ibm.cm.od.rdf2odf.MigrateRDF -h source_cmod_hostname -p port -e db_engine -i source_db_name -d output_directory\n             \n             Note: Run the command with no parameters for the full command syntax and options.\n             \n             \n         \n         \n      3. Import the XML file contents to your OnDemand instance. Take the four files (odfRecipients.xml, odfRecipientsLists.xml, odfReportIDs.xml, and odfDistributions.xml) created in the output directory and use the ARSXML command to import your new ODF definitions:\n          1. arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfRecipients.xml \n          2. arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfRecipientsLists.xml \n          3. arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfReportIDs.xml \n          4. arsxml add -h instance_name -u userid -p password -e cu -i odfDistributions.xml\n             \n             \n         \n         \n     \n     \n 9.  Verify the appropriate ulimit settings are in place for the OnDemand instance owner. Since the OnDemand server is a 64-bit process, the soft and hard limits for the user running the server process should be set to unlimited for data (-d), memory (-m), and stack (-s).\n     \n     \n 10. Start your OnDemand library and object server.\n     \n     \n\n\nHow to Uninstall OnDemand Server V9.5.0 \n\n\n\nTo uninstall OnDemand server V9.5.0:  * On Linux: /opt/ibm/ondemand/V9.5/_uninst950/uninstallod -i console \n * On Windows: Use Programs and Features in the Control Panel \n * All other platforms: /opt/IBM/ondemand/V9.5/_uninst950/uninstallod -i console\n\n\nTo uninstall Global Security Kit Crypt and Global Security Kit SSL, refer to the OnDemand README file. \n\nMiscellaneous \n\n\n\n * To upgrade to OnDemand server V9.5.0, the full install package must be downloaded from IBM Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/]. \n * On Windows, instructions to migrate to 64-bit DB2 are here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.upgrade.doc/doc/t0011000.html] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r5/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.migration.doc/doc/t0011000.html]. \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n CMOD V9.5 README [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043862]\nWhat's new in CMOD [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021523]\nCMOD V9.5.0 Publication Library [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27041745]",

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why are messages not being inserted into the Report Distribution logs for the Deliveries and Bundles folders? Also, there are error messages output to the console or nohup.out file like \"ARS6020E The database field 'rep_seq' was not found in the application group or it was not mapped to a folder field\".\n\n\nCAUSE\nReport Distribution Facility (RDF) uses ARSDOC ADD to add logging messages into the Report Distribution logs. Content Manager OnDemand V9.0.0.1, the command ARSDOC ADD has a new requirement where you must have the folder fields mapped to application group fields. The RDF Folder definitions must be updated.\n\nANSWER\nIf you use RDF that update to Content Manager OnDemand V.9 fix pack 1 (9.0.0.1) must update the definition of the RDF folders: System Report Distribution - Deliveries and System Report Distribution - Bundles. Both Folders have a field named rep_seq which maps to the application group field.

      " WHITE PAPER\n\nABSTRACT\n In product versions earlier than IBM\u00ae Content Manager OnDemand V8.4.1, administrators were required to grant full Oracle\u00ae DBA authority to the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner. In Content Manager OnDemand V8.4.1 and V8.5.0, clients can now use a reduced set of privileges.\n\nContent Manager OnDemand is typically installed with the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner having full DBA privileges. In Oracle environments, some clients want to install Content Manager OnDemand with a reduced set of database privileges to meet their own corporate guidelines. \n\nCONTENT\nContent Manager OnDemand can be installed, configured, and run in an Oracle 10g or later environment using a reduced set of database privileges. This article addresses the required privileges. Note that further DBA privileges might be required depending on the client's environment and future Content Manager OnDemand product fixes or enhancements.\n\n\nAdministrators can use the Oracle SQLPLUS utility to perform the following steps.\n\n1. Create the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner as a regular user. (See the Oracle Configuration Notes from the Content Manager OnDemand for Multiplatforms Installation and Configuration Guide.)\n\n2. Create the ONDEMAND role. The required privileges for a Content Manager OnDemand instance owner are grouped into this ONDEMAND role. To create the ONDEMAND role, from the SQLPLUS utility, run the attached SQL script, ora_create_ondemand_role.sql,as follows: \n\n * SQL> @ora_create_ondemand_role.sql \n\nora_create_ondemand_role.sql [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015003&aid=2]ora_create_ondemand_role.sql [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015003&aid=1] \n\n\n3. If the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner is already defined and currently has the DBA role, the DBA role should be removed using command:  * SQL> REVOKE DBA FROM <od_owner>;\n\n\n4. Grant the ONDEMAND role to the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner: \n\n * SQL> GRANT ONDEMAND TO <od_owner>;\n\n\n5. Grant to the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner an unlimited amount of any table space in the database:  * SQL> GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO <od_owner>;\n\n\nThis set of steps will provide the Content Manager OnDemand instance owner with the minimum set of privileges required to perform Oracle database tasks to manage the Content Manager OnDemand database. \n\nThe following code sample lists the contents of the attachment ora_create_ondemand_role.sql: \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n-- Create ONDEMAND role for Content Manager OnDemand instance owner \n-- \n-- Notes: \n-- SQL> @ora_create_ondemand_role.sql \n-- SQL> CREATE USER <od_owner> IDENTIFIED BY ora_od_password \n-- SQL> GRANT ONDEMAND TO <od_owner>; \n-- SQL> GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO <od_owner>; \n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n-- \n-- Create Content Manager OnDemand role : ONDEMAND \n-- \nDROP ROLE ONDEMAND; \nCREATE ROLE ONDEMAND; \n\n\n-- Database \ngrant ALTER SYSTEM to ONDEMAND; \ngrant SELECT ANY DICTIONARY to ONDEMAND; \n\n-- Session \ngrant CREATE SESSION to ONDEMAND; \n\n-- Tablespaces \ngrant CREATE TABLESPACE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant DROP TABLESPACE to ONDEMAND; \n\n-- Tables \ngrant ALTER ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant BACKUP ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant CREATE TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant DELETE ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant DROP ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant INSERT ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant LOCK ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant SELECT ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \ngrant UPDATE ANY TABLE to ONDEMAND; \n\n-- Indexes \ngrant CREATE ANY INDEX to ONDEMAND; \ngrant DROP ANY INDEX to ONDEMAND; \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Oracle document for GRANT [http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28286/statements_9013.htm#SQLRF01603]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on AIX V8.5 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i07130.htm#oraccfgaix]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on HP-UX V8.5 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071171.htm#oraccfghp]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Solaris V8.5 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071312.htm#oraccfgsol]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Windows V8.5 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071588.htm#oraccfgwin]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Linux V8.5 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071453.htm#oraccfglin]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on AIX V9 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i07130.htm?path=2_0_3_4_1_0#oraccfgaix]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Solaris V9 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071322.htm?path=2_0_5_4_1_0#oraccfgsol]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Linux V9 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071468.htm?path=2_0_6_4_1_0#oraccfglin]\nConfiguration notes for Oracle on Windows V9 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071608.htm?path=2_0_7_3_1_0#oraccfgwin]"

This message is not reported on all appliances and can occur rarely in the field. \n\nANSWER\nThe following message would be present in the DataPower logs: \n\nSystem power supply #2 has failed.\n\nor logging event code: \n\n0x80400022 System power supply #2 \n\n\nThe problem can be confirmed by issuing the following commands on the appliance CLI:\n\nco \ntest hardware \nexit \n\nThe following output from the test hardware command confirms this problem: \n\n[failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not present.\n[failure] Power supply '2' has no AC input power, or is not present.\n\nOther results in the test hardware command might also show incorrect values.\n\nThis problem does not affect the operation of the appliance other than the continuous reporting power supply failure message. \n\nTo confirm the power supplies are working normally you may check the LED status on the power supplies. If the LED's are green the power supplies are working normally.\n\n\nTo recover from the false errors perform a reboot of the appliance: \n\nFrom the WebGUI: \n\nControl Panel \u2192 System Control \u2192 In the \u201cShutdown\u201d section choose \u201cReboot System\u201d then click \u201cShutdown\u201d \n\n \n\nFrom the CLI: \n\ntop \n\nshutdown reboot \n\ny \n\n\nThis problem is caused by a highly intermittent error that may allow the sensor reading mechanism to get into a bad state. This bad state then generates the false error messages. In most cases, a reboot of the appliance will reset the sensors and no additional errors are logged. The highly intermittent error rarely occurs again on the same appliance \n\nIf the issue reoccurs on the same appliance contact IBM DataPower support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] with the following information: \n\n1) How many times have you seen the issue on the same appliance? \n\n2) Gather the outputs for the following CLI commands:\nshow clock\nshow version\nshow ipmi\nshow sensors-other\nconfig\nservice show\ntest hardware"

It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.\n\nIBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.\n\nHardware \n\nDataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].\n\nFor end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. \n\nFirmware \n\nBusinesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.\n\nEffective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:\n\n 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.\n    \n    \n 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.\n     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.\n     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.\n    \n    \n\nFirmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nFirmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nNote: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported.

      "1072; Linux; Patch; SUSE; RHEL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The article points out some known issues that are common with the Linux RPM Patching product and processes. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n * Some SuSE RPM packages are not downloadable from Novell.com, and they are in the Installation ISOs only.\n   Solution: This will be manual process, and ISOExtractor.exe can help to simply this process. See KB 1009 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21505758] for more information.\n * There are no SuSE pre-packaged fixlets for the user to customize.\n   Solution: In current phase, we do not provide pre-packaged SuSE fixlets but we will in the next phase. Currently the multi-Fixlet mode in \"Create Custom Fixlet\" page is not available for SuSE. User needs to enter full rpm of the SuSE Linux RPM packages.\n * Potential Download Mirroring problem in DSA\n   Solution: This should not be a huge problem because during normal operation, each DSA TEM server automatically downloads and caches files from the other. When taking action from Fixlet # 7 \"Run Download Cacher Tool - Red Hat Enterprise Linux\" or taking action from the custom fixlet that is generated by the \"Linux RPM Patching\" Dashboard, user can target both DSA TEM Server so that RPM packages will be cached on both Server. The minor drawback is duplication. Another workaround is to run the download cacher manually on bother server with same set of switches/arguments. Alternatively, you can also run the download cacher on one primary TEM Server, and transfer the files over to the secondary TEM Server. \n * How to download RPM package in an Air-Gapped Network? \n   Solution: yes, but it will be manual process like the other products. Basically user need to look into TEM Client Log file (Default: C:\\Program Files\\BigFix Enterprise\\BES Client\\__BESData\\__Global\\Logs) to find the command line. Then the user need to run the same command on machine that is connected to the internet for downloading the required RPM Packages. At the end user need to transfer those file back to the sha1 folder of the original TEM Server machine. \n   For Red Hat Linux Enterprise, follow the below instructions:  1. Go the TEM Client Log file folder (See default path above)\n    2. Find the RHEL air gap files based on the action ID.\n    3. Transfer those two files to the computer that is connected to the internet.\n    4. Download the RHEL.UnixSD download cacher and run it based on the arguments listed on the file whose name starts with \"RHEL_Airgap\".Please note that you might need to change some arguments, such \"Cache\", and log file directory etc. \n   \n   For SuSE Enterprise Linux, follow the below instructions:  1. Go the TEM Client Log file folder (See default path above)\n    2. Find the SuSE air gap files based on the action ID. There may be two files if you are caching rpm package for bother SuSE 9 and SuSE 10 fixlets.\n    3. Transfer those two files to the computer that is connected to the internet.\n    4. Download the SUSE Download Cacher and run it based on arguments listed on the file(s). Please note that you might need to change some arguments, such \"Cache\", and log file directory etc.\n   \n   \n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 1072",

It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.\n\nIBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.\n\nHardware \n\nDataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].\n\nFor end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. \n\nFirmware \n\nBusinesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.\n\nEffective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:\n\n 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.\n    \n    \n 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.\n     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.\n     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.\n    \n    \n\nFirmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nFirmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nNote: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported. By using the information in this table, customers can effectively plan their firmware investment without any gaps in support.\n\nRelease Support Model GA date End-of-service date Comment 7.7.0

    "gold_doc": [
      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n An out of memory may be observed on a system running WebSphere Application Server on Linux or AIX that is due to ulimit restrictions on number of process/threads per user. Further investigation may reveal a \"Failed to create a thread:\" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java/lang/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted."

We do not have any client side installation for Salesforce Pack 1.5 on IS 8.5. This means the installation of Salesforce Pack is only done on the IS 8.5 Server machine. \n 2. CC_EXT_JNI_DIRS is no longer being used. CLASSPATH is being used. This \n    will be set automatically during the installation of Salesforce Pack 1.5, but manual intervention is needed once Salesforce Pack 1.5 is installed on IS 8.5. You will have to manually change the CLASSPATH environment variable on the IBM InfoSphere DataStage server as follows:  *  Unix or Linux \n       Edit the value for the CLASSPATH environment variable in the dsenv file from \n       /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/apps/etc/com.ibm.ws.security.crypto.jar \n       to \n       /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.isf.client_8.5.0.0/com.ibm.ws.security.crypto.jar\n       \n     * Microsoft Windows \n       Edit the value for the CLASSPATH environment variable in the System Properties from c:\\IBM\\InformationServer\\ASBNode\\apps\\etc\\com.ibm.ws.security.crypto.jar \n       to \n       c:\\IBM\\\\InformationServer\\ASBNode\\eclipse\\plugins\\com.ibm.isf.client_8.5.0.0\\com.ibm.ws.security.crypto.jar\n       \n       After the changes to CLASSPATH are made the Engine and the NodeAgents need to be restarted on both Unix or Linux and Windows.\n       \n       Note: The instructions above use the default install location if you installed to a different location you need to adjust the path accordingly.\n       \n    \n    \n 3. If you have previously defined the CC_JNI_EXT_DIRS environment variable, you must remove it before running the InfoSphere Information Server Pack for Salesforce.com, Version 1.5 on InfoSphere Information Server, Version 8.5. \n 4. To avoid a Java runtime \"out of memory\" error, you must append -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no to the existing CC_JVM_OPTIONS environment variable. \n    \n    For example:\n    CC_JVM_OPTIONS=\"-Dcom.ibm.SSL.ConfigURL=file:/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.isf.client/ssl.client.props -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no\"; export CC_JVM_OPTIONS\n    \n 5.

      "ulimit process pid determine get TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process be determined on Linux? \n\nANSWER\nThere are a number of situations where determining the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process may be necessary. The more common scenarios include determining the maximum number of file descriptors for a given process or generating a system core from a given process.\n\n\nStep 1\n-Determine the Process ID (PID) of the IBM WebSphere Application Server process to be investigated. \n\nIf the PID is already known, proceed to step 2. \n\nIf the PID is unknown then inspect the contents of the following file to determine the PID: \n\n<install_root>/profiles/<profile_name>/logs/<server_name>/<server_name>.pid \n\n * This file should exist if the server is currently running. Exceptional circumstances could lead to a situation where this file exists and the server is not running.\n\n\nThe number contained within this file is the PID of the running server.  \n\nStep 2\nOnce the PID is known, inspect the file at the following location: \n\nLocation: /proc/<PID> \n\nFile: limits \n\n * The contents of this file is similar to the output of the \"ulimit -a\" command.\n\n\nThis file will have a list of ulimit parameters and their associated values for the specified PID. \n\nSample \nLimit Soft Limit ... \nMax cpu time unlimited \nMax file size unlimited \nMax data size unlimited \nMax stack size 10485760 \nMax core file size unlimited \nMax processes unlimited \nMax open files 8192 \n...  \n\n \n\nLimitations\nThis method is only available to more recent versions of IBM WebSphere Application Server supported Linux operating systems. \n\nThe following is a list of minimum operating system versions and maintenance levels where this technique is usable: \n\n * RHEL 4 Update 7 \n * RHEL 5 Update 2 \n * SLES 10 Service Pack 3 \n * SLES 11\n\n\nThere may be some exceptions to this list, and this list is not necessarily exhaustive; however, all the major maintenance levels (Updates / Service Packs) for RHEL 4 and 5 and SLES 9, 10, and 11 were tested. This list reflects the findings of those tests. \n\nThere may be some incremental maintenance that can be applied to support this method prior to the above versions and maintenance levels as only major maintenance levels were tested.",

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * /etc/security/limits Description ulimit -c [value] core\ncore_hard Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) data\ndata_hard Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] fsize\nfsize_hard File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] nofiles\nnofiles_hard Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value]\n(K bytes) rss\nrss_hard The memory size of the process in kilobytes. ulimit -r [value] threads\nthreads_hard Max number of threads per process. ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) stack\nstack_hard The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) cpu\ncpu_hard Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -u [value] nproc\nnproc_hard Specifies the limit of the number of processes per user. * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information \n\n\nHP-UX \n\nThere is no global settings file on HP-UX. Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nThere are similar kernel settings you can also set with kctune, such as \"maxfiles_lim\", but these kernel parameters do not normally need to be changed. Please refer to its man page for further information. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand \"ulimit\" limit_name* Description ulimit -c [value] Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value] Data segment size of processes in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -f [value] File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value] The memory size of the process in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -s [value] The stack segment size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\nLinux \nGlobal settings are set in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. \n\nThe format for setting each limit is as follows:\n<domain> <type> <item> <value> \n\n<domain> controls which users or groups will have these limits \n\n<type> is either the string \"soft\" or \"hard\" limits.\nThe hyphen \"-\" can also be used which represents both soft and hard limits \n\n<item> and <value> are shown in the table below. Most values can also use the string unlimited. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between Linux variants. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits.conf file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name /etc/security/limits.conf <item> Description ulimit -c [value] core Max core dump file size (KB) ulimit -d [value] data Max data size (KB) ulimit -f [value] fsize Max file size (KB) ulimit -l [value] memlock Max size of address space that can be locked into memory (KB) ulimit -n [value] nofile Max number of open files/sockets per process** ulimit -u [value] nproc Max number of processes for a single user ulimit -m [value] rss Max resident set size (KB) ulimit -s [value] stack The maximum stack size (KB) ulimit -t [value] cpu Max CPU time (minutes or seconds) ** There is a restriction that occurs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that this value cannot be set to unlimited \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolaris \n\nThere is no global settings file specifically for ulimits on Solaris (however you can set kernel-wide settings in the /etc/system file). Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21377724]\nAIX - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.aix.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]\nLinux - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/java7sdk/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.lnx.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]",

Gathering this information before calling IBM support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThis document details the MustGather data to be collected for WebSphere Application Server Community Edition when IBM Java 1.5 or IBM Java 1.6 Runtime crashes on the Linux operating system.\nSetup for a Crash on Linux\nThe information below will allow you to ensure that the required settings are in place to generate Crash data files\n\nEnsure generation of core dump files\nWhen a crash occurs, the most important diagnostic data to obtain is the process core file. In order to ensure this is generated for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on Linux there are a number of settings that need to be in place. The majority of the JVM settings are in place by default, but operating system settings also need to be in place, and these vary by distribution and Linux version.\n\nThe following settings need to be in place: \n\n * Operating system settings To obtain full core files set the following ulimit options:  * ulimit -c unlimited turn on corefiles with unlimited size \n    * ulimit -n unlimited allows an unlimited number of open file descriptors \n    * ulimit -u unlimited sets the user memory limit to unlimited \n    * ulimit -f unlimited sets the file limit to unlimited\n   \n   \n   The current ulimit settings can be displayed using: \n   ulimit -a \n   These values are the \"soft\" limit, and are done on a per user basis. These cannot exceed the \"hard\" limit value. In order to display and change the \"hard\" limits, the same ulimit commands can be run using the additional -H flag.\n   \n   Note: As of Java 5.0 GA, the ulimit -c value for the soft limit will be ignored and the hard limit value used in order to help ensure generation of the core file. Core file generation can be disabled by using the following Java command line option: \n   -Xdump:system:none \n   \n * Java Virtual Machine settings \n   To generate core files on crash events:\n   \n   Check that the JVM is set to produce a core file when a crash occurs, run the following:\n   \n   java -Xdump:what \n   Which should produce the following: \n   dumpFn=doSystemDump\n   events=gpf+abort\n   filter=\n   label=/usr/sdk/jre/bin/core.%Y%m%d.%H%M%S.%pid.dmp\n   range=1..0\n   priority=999\n   request=nodumps \n   The values above are the default settings. At least events=gpf must be set in order to generate a core file when a crash occurs. Options can be changed and set using the command line option: \n   -Xdump:system[:=, ...] \n   More information about using the -Xdump option is available here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21242497] \n   \n * Available disk space \n   It is also important to ensure that there is enough disk space available for the core file to be written. The JVM allows the core file to be written to any directory that is specified in the label option. i.e. \n   \n   -Xdump:system:label=/usr/sdk/jre/bin/core.%Y%m%d.%H%M%S.%pid.dmp \n   In order for the core file to be written to this location, there must be sufficient disk space (up to 4GB might be required for a 32-bit process, and even larger for a 64-bit process), and the correct permissions for the Java process to write to that location. \n   \n   \n\nEnsure gdb is installed \n\n\nEnsure javacore.txt generation is setup \nThe Javadump (javacore) is a useful file to provide information about the general state of the Java runtime and the applications running on it. In order to ensure this is generated the relevant settings must be in place. Although they are set by default it is possible that the default setting has been changed so it is important to check that the correct settings are in place. \n\nCheck that the JVM is set to produce a javadump file when a user signal (SIGQUIT) or GPF (General Protection Fault, for example, SIGSEGV) occurs, by adding the following command line option: \n\njava -Xdump:what \nWhich shows the options which are set, such as: \n\ndumpFn=doJavaDump\nevents=gpf+user+abort\nfilter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError\nlabel=/usr/sdk/jre/bin/javacore.%Y%m%d.%H%M%S.%pid.txt\nrange=1..0\npriority=10\nrequest=exclusive \nThe preceding values are the default settings. At least events=gpf and events=user must be in place to generate javadumps on a crash or a user signal. Options can be changed and set using the command line option: \n\n-Xdump:java[:=,...] \nSo, for example, to set the ability to generate javadump files on user signals you would use: \n\n-Xdump:java:events=user \n\nGathering data \nThe following steps should be taken to collect the necessary diagnostic data  1. Run gdb against the core file to collect native stack listings\n    Generate the native stack listings from the core file located as specified by the label field n the -Xdump:what output as shown the in setup:\n    \n    gdb -x gdb_commands.txt [java executable] [core file] > native_stacks.out \n    Where gdb_commands.txt contains: \n    thread apply all bt \n    Then, collect the output. \n    \n 2. Run JExtract against the core file\n    \n    <SDK>/jre/bin/jextract [core file] \n    Collect the .xml output along with the core.dmp output.\n    \n    Note: The jextract tool from the same SDK that crashed should be used. \n    \n 3. Collect the javadump (javacore) file\n    This should be in the location detailed against the label field in the -Xdump:what output as shown the in setup. \n    \n    \n 4. Collect any stdout and stderr generated by the Java process \n    \n    \n 5. Collect the system messages file\n    \n    cp /var/log/messages system_messages.txt \n    \n\n\nAdditional information  * Testcase to simulate the crash (if any) \n * Recent changes to the environment prior to crash \n * Collect general information of the server as discussed here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21231419#generalMustGather]\n\n\nThese data files should then be submitted to IBM Support.

SSH into the Data Server(s) and enter the following command at the prompt; \n\n\npsql -U dfuser dfdata -c \"insert into adminknobs (name,value,description,valuetype,use) VALUES ('read_sparse_files','1','Read sprase data objects','int','1')\"\n\nIt should return the following;\n\nINSERT 0 1\n\nif so, enter the following command and wait for the UI to come back up;\n\nservice siqinit restart\n\nYou can now run harvests as normal and sparse data objects will be processed. If your are using a policy which backs up the original files and just leaves a sparse file viewable that when accessed, will pull the original file forward, you may run into space issues. This is because SIQ will be accessing every sparse file, so the sparse files' size on disk will grow to the same size as the original file."

      " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n I am having trouble mounting and harvesting an Exchange volume in StoredIQ. What steps can I take to to troubleshoot this issue? \n\nCAUSE\nWhen mounting an Exchange volume within StoredIQ there are many factors that must be taken into consideration to ensure success.\nThe basic premise of an Exchange mount is that on an exchange volume StoredIQ actually consults the Active Directory Domain controller to return a list of mailboxes to target for harvest. \n\nLook here for initial setup of volume configuration options (under Exchange): \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/tsk/tsk_creatingprimaryvolumes.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/tsk/tsk_creatingprimaryvolumes.html] \n\nFor initial troubleshooting and configuration of Exchange volume: \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/cpt/cpt_configuringexchangeservers.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/cpt/cpt_configuringexchangeservers.html] \n\nThis guide is to address issues that delve into issues that are still persistent after consulting the pages above.\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nStoredIQ Dataserver\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen we add an Exchange volume here is a high level overview of the steps we need to be successful on: \n\n1) Exchange uses the EWS API which lets you talk to the mailbox store via the client access server (CAS) where Outlook Web Access (OWA) is. \n\n2) However, the above doesn\u2019t let you locate the users that we want to scope to\u2026this is where we leverage Active Directory to return a list of mailboxes to target. \n\n3) In order to leverage Active Directory, we need to first generate a Kerberos Ticket for us to authenticate to perform the LDAP queries. \n\n4) After successfully generating a Kerberos ticket we can connect to AD and ask which users are on this mailbox server, then authenticate to EWS using NTLM or Kerberos and start making queries to start harvesting\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nGoing off from the overview above below is troubleshooting guide: \n\n1) The Server Field should contain the Fully Qualified Domain of the CAS server where the OWA is. The OWA (Outlook Web Access) is typically where one logs on the web into the Exchange server. Consult your Exchange admin if you do not know what the address of the CAS server where the OWA is. \n\nTroubleshooting steps \n\na. Check if SSL is enabled in the Volume config \n\nb. Check if user is able to login via OWA with the user and verify that you are able to check other mailboxes \n\nc. Verify user has necessary permissions - Exchange permissions (important please read): http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/cpt/cpt_configuringexchangeservers.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/cpt/cpt_configuringexchangeservers.html] \n\nd. Check initial directory field -- For Exchange, this field must be left blank if you are harvesting all mailboxes. If you are harvesting a single mailbox, enter the email address for that mailbox. \n\n2) In order to first test whether or not we are able to reach Active Directory, try pinging the AD server: \n\na. If you do not know which AD server we are trying to reach, enter the command on your Dataserver console (putty session) \u2018dig SRV _kerberos._tcp.domain.com +noall +answer\u2019 replacing \u2018domain.com\u2019 with your companies domain.

Run a \u2018ping adserver.domain.com\u2019 command on your Dataserver console (Putty session) to see whether or not you can ping the AD server \n\nc. If you cannot ping the AD server, check to see that the AD server is added to the /etc/resolv.conf file. Run the command \u2018cat /etc/resolv.conf\u2019 and verify that the server exists there. \n\nIf it does not run the command \u2018vim /etc/resolv.conf\u2019 to edit the file. Press \u2018insert\u2019 to go into editing mode. Make the changes. Then press \u2018Esc\u2019 to escape editing mode. Hit \u2018:wq\u2019 and hit \u2018Enter\u2019 to write and save changes and quit. \n\nd. Try pinging AD server again. If it still fails add the AD server hostname to the /etc/hosts on your Dataserver. Run the command \u2018vim /etc/hosts\u2019 and edit the file adding the IP address of the AD server in the first column, then pressing \u2018Tab\u2019 to add a space and then writing the host name of the AD server. This will let your Dataserver know exactly which IP corresponds to your AD server. \n\ne. Try pinging the AD server, this should be successful at this point. \n\n3) As mentioned above, we need to generate a Kerberos ticket to successfully mount an Exchange volume. \n\na. First try to generate one (replacing DOMAIN.COM with your domain \u2013 all CAPS are important. Replace user with a domain Admin username)\n\nRun 'kinit user@DOMAIN.COM' and see if successful. If successful, you should receive a prompt for the password for the domain admin username entered. \n\nb. When the above is successful, let\u2019s run an LDAP query to see if we are able to return a list of mailboxes \u2013 we are essentially emulating what an Exchange harvest will do here.\n\nEnter the command below on your Dataserver (replacing domainController.domain.com with your AD server FQDN and domain and com with the appropriate values):\nldapsearch -Q -LLL -h domainController.domain.com -b \"dc=domain,dc=com\" \"(&(&(&(mailnickname=*)(mail=*))(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))))\" mail\n\nIf successful we should see a return of a list of mailboxes, for example:\n\nex: ldapsearch -E pr=100/noprompt -Q -LLL -h siq-lab-ad01.siq-lab.local -b \"dc=siq-lab,dc=local\" \"(&(&(&(mailnickname=*)(mail=*))(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))))\" mail \n\nfn: Administrator@siq-lab.local \n\nfn: user1@siq-lab.local \n\nfn: user2@siq-lab.local \n\nfn: user3@siq-lab.local \n\nc. If our LDAP query is unsuccessful or does not show the mail objects we expect:\n\nFrom our DIG command in Step 2a, try running the LDAP query on each AD server shown there and see if any return different results. The one to return the correct results, is the AD server you want to specify in the StoredIQ volume config. \n\ni. Check that LDAP port 389 is open on the AD server Domain Controller by running the command below on your Dataserver (replacing adserver.domain.com with your AD server FQDN):\n\ntelnet adserver.domain.com 389\n\nIf successful it should say \u2018Connected to adserver.domain.com\u2019.\nPress \u2018Ctrl+c\u2019to get out of this prompt\n\nIf we are unsuccessful, there is a firewall issue, please consult your Server Admin (IT Team) \n\nd. If our LDAP query is successful then we should be able to successfully mount the Exchange volume. \n\n4) We should be able to successfully mount the Exchange volume at this point. If we are still not able to check the last few things below: \n\na. Make sure SSL is enabled on the Exchange volume config \n\nb. Check for appropriate permissions for the user being used to mount the volume \n\nc. Make sure the server we are trying to mount is a CAS server which the OWA resides, consult IT to make sure this info is correct in addition to credentials\n\n5) If you are still seeing the error 'kinit Client not found in Kerberos database while getting initial credentials, when mounting the volume' on the StoredIQ Volume UI, after successfully generating a Kerberos Ticket and running an LDAP query on the Command Line Interface on your Dataserver, then it is likely the case the DOMAIN you are running the Kerberos command against is different than the Domain of the AD server you input in the vol config.\n\nMake sure AD server and the Kerberos ticket Domains are the same in the volume configuration.\n\n6) If you see the case where your volume mounts or harvests sometimes are successful and sometimes just fail or stop, it is likely the case that the kinit step is failing sometimes due to it only authenticating against the correct server(s) sometimes and not every time.\n\nIt is possible to confirm this by editing your /etc/krb5.conf file and specifying a KDC for the specific realm, turning off 'dns_lookup_kdc' to False in section '[libdefaults], and then running the kinit command in Step 3 against each different KDC server listed from the Dig command in Step 2.\n\nIf you can confirm that only a few certain KDCs let you authenticate successfully, you may specify which ones to use by adding a realm entry and following the example below such as :\n\nSTOREDIQ.COM = { \n\n kdc = adserver.storediq.com \n\ndefault_domain = storediq.com \n\n}\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Exchange Volume Config Options [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/tsk/tsk_creatingprimaryvolumes.html]\nInitial Troubleshooting [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/admin/cpt/cpt_configuringexchangeservers.html]",

The cache for reading and writing were combined together in the one statement.\n\nIn PowerPlay 5.2, the size for cache for 'reading' and 'writing' are stated separately. \n\nIf a user is the administrator creating the Powercube, then this user could set the \"WriteCacheSize=\" to a larger increment than the \"ReadCacheSize=\". \n\nIf the user is only reading the Powercube, not creating it, then the \"ReadCacheSize=\" could be set to a larger increment than the \"WriteCacheSize=\" setting.\n\nIn order to use available memory more efficiently, such as allowing it to be better shared with other users, PPDS may now work with different sizes of shared cache in read and write/update modes. These sizes are specified either in cognos.ini (under Windows) or in environment variables (under Unix).\n\nThe cache size is to be specified in kBytes; a value smaller than 100 kBytes is automatically modified to 100 kBytes. When the cache is used in write/update mode, it is generally advantageous to flush more than one of its records into the container database at the same time. You can control the rate of this bulk database flushing via the flushPercentage value. FlushPercentage is the %-age of cache memory that is released whenever the cache is full (its least recently used records are selected). The value is supplied in .01% scale, such as 530 interpreted as 5.30%. A value > 5000 (i.e. > 50%) is automatically changed to 50%.

A value <= 99, for example, < 1% is changed to 1%.\n\nThe default cache settings are reflected in the table above. The default read cache size is 2048 kBytes (~2MB) for Windows and 16000 kBytes (~16MB) for UNIX. The default write cache size is 4096 kBytes (~4MB) for Windows and 32000 kBytes (~32MB) for UNIX. \nThe default flushPercentage value was set at 5% on the expectation that this value might improve the load timing as then PPDS, on average, utilizes the available memory to 97.5%.\n\nAs we allow only one updator (or many readers) at any given time, the write mode can be in force only for one PowerCube at a time.

In order to better understand this, you have to be aware of what processes are using memory during a cube build. Here is a listing of the main players:\n\n-Operating System (OS)\n-Disk Cache which is maintained by OS\n-Transformer\n-RP (Transformer object repository)\n-DMS (Data Management Services). This is relevant to PowerPlay 6.x and only if 'SortMemory' setting is used.\n-PPDS (PowerPlay Data Server)\n\nTransformer DMS and RP dominate the data read and category creation portion of the cube build. During the Metadata and Cube update phases, PPDS and Disk Cache (and RP to some extent) are involved. The amount of physical memory available during these times is critical to better build times. \n\nIf concentrating on the metadata and cube update phase, the best performance will be obtained if there is enough physical memory in the system so that the Disk Cache can grow to be as large as the final size of the PowerCube (MDC). This is because building an MDC results in many inserts, updates and deletions by PPDS. If the PowerCube is entirely in memory (Disk Cache), then cube build performance will be optimum since there is no need by PPDS to access the hard disk to retrieve information. Assigning more memory to PPDS (via the WriteCacheSize entry) can also benefit build time. It will reduce the number of disk i/o?s required by PPDS but only if this does not take away memory from the Disk Cache. On systems where there is a lot of memory, it is not necessary for you to consider assigning as much memory to PPDS as is available.\n\nExample\n\nFor a model where the final cube size was 65MB on a computer with 512MB RAM:\nusing WriteCacheSize = 4MB = build time of 162 minutes\nusing WriteCacheSize = 32MB = build time of 137 minutes\n\nIn this case, more than 32MB of PPDS memory is used because the machines only have 512MB of RAM and the larger cubes are in the 400MB range.\n\n\nReadCacheSize\nThis is essentially a client and enterprise server setting that can impact read performance. \n\nExample\n\nUsing Enterprise server on a large Windows NT server with 512MB of RAM, the ReadCacheSize is set to 64MB and performs with excellent results.\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Analytics Cognos 8 Business Intelligence Analysis Studio Business Analytics Cognos Series 7 PowerPlay Business Analytics Cognos Series 7 Transformer \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 99011",
      "tsa; tsamp; rsct; cthats; netmon; :TS_LOC_DOWN_ST; malfunction; crossover; NIC; best practices TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When the primary server in my 2 node cluster goes down, the network adapter on the standby server starts being reported as malfunctioning or offline as well. This often prevents a failover or causes unexpected outages on the standby server. \n\nCAUSE\nMar 3 11:33:02 node02 daemon:notice cthats[6684704]: :::TS_LOC_DOWN_ST Possible malfunction on local adapter Adapter interface name en3 Adapter offset 0 Adapter IP address 10.11.12.13\n\nANSWER\nA \"link down\" problem can be caused by a problem at either end of the link, that is, a problem with either of the individual network adapters (NIC), or it can be a result of problem with a network device in between. In the case where two servers are connected to the same switch or directly connected via a crossover cable, its often impossible for the RSCT's local subsystem to know if its local NIC is the source of the problem or if the NIC on the other server is the problem. This is where the netmon (network monitor) functionality can help. \n\nYou can (and should in the case of a two node cluster) exploit the netmon functionality by creating a file on each node in the cluster called: \n\n * \n\n\nThe netmon.cf file is a simple text file populated as follow : \n- one IP address per line \n- it is generally recommended that there be 5+ pingable IP addresses (if available). \n- the IP addresses do not need to be part of your cluster or know what your cluster is. \n- the IP addresses *do* need to be pingable from all the nodes in the cluster. \n\nAt the very least, include the IP address of the default gateway for your clustered nodes in your netmon.cf file. Copy your netmon.cf file to each node in the domain. There is no need to restart the domain ... the netmon.cf is usable immediately. \n\nNote that the netmon.cf file is only used when there is a cluster split (where one or more nodes in the cluster can no longer communicate with each other). The \"netmon\" function will generate pings, using the IP addresses in the local netmon.cf file, in the hopes of generating inbound traffic on the local interface. RSCT does *not* watch specifically for responses to these pings ... it merely sends them out and then watches the interface again for any new traffic coming in ... this is how RSCT can quickly determine if a local NIC is functional or not. \n\nRefer to the following Technote for a detailed explanation of the netmon process and the netmon.cf file: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21289897 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21289897]",
      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What do these errors in the event/harvest/policy audit logs mean? \n\nANSWER\nIn the Data Server Admin Guide please take a look at sections:\nChapter 10\n- Harvest Audits > Table 40. Harvest overview detailed results: Fields and descriptions\n- Policy Audits > Policy Audit Messages\n\nAppendix C Event log messages \n- ERROR event log messages\n\n\nExample Audit Errors from Classification and Copy Actions\n\nNo text content\n- No text available in the documents to determine classification - autoclassification is based on text content in the document so it will fail because there is no text available to use\n\nMissing-source-file\n- File no longer exists on the volume - recall that infosets are snapshots of volumes which actions are run on - this simply means the files no longer exist on the source volume, though the infoset includes them\n\nFile-modified-after-last-harvest-skipping-copy\n- When an incremental harvest is ran and a file is updated, that file is reharvested and the old remains in the index - this indicates the old one is skipped\n\nCould-not-create-target-file\n- The reasoning for not being able to create a file can differ. First things to try would be to examine permissions and then retry. Also examine storage levels.\n\nInsufficient-permissions-to-perform-operations-on-file-dir\n- Permissions to perform actions are often times different than harvesting. Copying usually requires full share level permissions both on the source and destination.\n\nFailed-to-mount-the-volume-for-the-action\n- The volume failed to mount, can be due to a variety of reasons. Try manually remounting the volume on the Dataserver or Appstack and troubleshoot there. First places to examine are permissions, expired service accounts, changed FQDN or IP, changed AD server etc."

      " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n You have added a channel authentication record into a WebSphere MQ 7.1 or later queue manager:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL) ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nThen you display it:\n\nDISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\n1 : DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)\nCLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\nNow you want to remove it and you try executing the following runmqsc command which you constructed using copy and paste from the above output:\n\nDELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n3 : DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)\n\nYou get the following error:\n\nAMQ8405: Syntax error detected at or near end of command segment below:-\nDELETE CHLAUTH\n\nThe DELETE CHLAUTH does not exist and after consulting the MQ 7.1 Information Center you read that you have to use the SET CHLAUTH command with the argument ACTION(REMOVE). You try now:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n19 : SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n\nBut you get the following error:\n\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou specified the attribute CLNTUSER(testuser) as it was shown in the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*), thus, you think the record should be found. You want to know what is the problem?\n\n\nCAUSE\nSee the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:\nWebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands\nWebSphere MQ object names [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/fa11060_.htm]\n+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands\nMQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries"
