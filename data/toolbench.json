It is a time of joy, love, and giving, and is traditionally celebrated on December 25th every year. The holiday has its roots in Christianity, where it commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, but it is now celebrated by people of all religions and cultures.  Christmas is a time when families and friends come together to celebrate and enjoy each other's company. It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving. It is a time to come together with friends and family and celebrate the holiday season. While the holiday has its roots in Christianity, it is now celebrated by people of all cultures and religions around the world. Christmas traditions bring people together and create memories that will last a lifetime.\"}]}",

Christmas is a time when families and friends come together to celebrate and enjoy each other's company. It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving.

This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones.

This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies.

It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving. It is a time to come together with friends and family and celebrate the holiday season. While the holiday has its roots in Christianity, it is now celebrated by people of all cultures and religions around the world. Christmas traditions bring people together and create memories that will last a lifetime.\"}]}",

This is currently planned and in development - if you have ideas for other platforms you'd like to be supported feel free to reach out!\\n\\nQ.  What is the accuracy of the estimations?\\nA. This estimator has been tested in dozens of real-life campaigns with clients spending 6-7 figures on each influencer native ad campaign, totaling out in a median margin of error of 10%. Not bad!\\n\\nWe will say that while most channels have a certain degree of predictability in terms of performance, more popular *and* less frequently posting channels are outliers that the estimator will only be so accurate in estimating.\\n\\nQ. So no guarantees? How should I use this?\\nA. Use it like the creators of the API have: as a way to understand baseline performance of a given influencer's channel and how you can back out of that with your own campaign's goals to a pricing number that makes sense.\\n\\nQ. Is there an offering for this API to integrate *directly* into my application?\\nA. Yes, feel free to reach out and we can discuss more custom integrations including callback url support\\n\\nQ.

This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving.

This estimator has been tested in dozens of real-life campaigns with clients spending 6-7 figures on each influencer native ad campaign, totaling out in a median margin of error of 10%.

So no guarantees? How should I use this?\\nA. Use it like the creators of the API have: as a way to understand baseline performance of a given influencer's channel and how you can back out of that with your own campaign's goals to a pricing number that makes sense.\\n\\nQ. Is there an offering for this API to integrate *directly* into my application?\\nA. Yes, feel free to reach out and we can discuss more custom integrations including callback url support\\n\\nQ.

This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones.

This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving.

In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies.

It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving.

In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies.

Christmas is a time when families and friends come together to celebrate and enjoy each other's company. It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving.

    "answer": "1. First, validate the phone number using the \"basic_phone_number_validation_for_scout\" function with the dialcode \"+1650\".\n2. Since the phone number is invalid and impossible for any specific region, try validating it again with the country code \"US\" using the same function.\n3. The phone number is still invalid and impossible for any specific region, even with the country code \"US\". Therefore, use the \"advanced_phone_number_lookup_for_scout\" function with the dialcode \"+1650\" to get more information.\n4. The advanced lookup confirms that the phone number is invalid and impossible for any specific region. Thus, provide the user with the final answer that the phone number is invalid and the approximate location, timezone, and carrier associated with the number cannot be determined.",

Christmas is a time when families and friends come together to celebrate and enjoy each other's company. It is a time to share meals, exchange gifts, and participate in various traditions and activities. One of the most beloved traditions of Christmas is decorating a Christmas tree. This tradition originated in Germany and has since spread around the world. Families often decorate their trees with lights, ornaments, and tinsel.  Another beloved tradition is the exchange of gifts. Many people spend weeks or even months searching for the perfect gift for their loved ones. Giving and receiving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation for one another, and it is a way to bring joy to those around us.  Christmas is also a time for giving back to those in need. Many people donate their time, money, or resources to charities and organizations that help those who are less fortunate. This spirit of giving is one of the most important aspects of Christmas and helps to spread love and kindness to those who need it most.  In addition to these traditions, there are many other customs associated with Christmas. These include caroling, baking Christmas cookies, and watching Christmas movies. Each of these traditions brings a unique sense of joy and excitement to the holiday season.  In conclusion, Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving. It is a time to come together with friends and family and celebrate the holiday season.

This estimator has been tested in dozens of real-life campaigns with clients spending 6-7 figures on each influencer native ad campaign, totaling out in a median margin of error of 10%.

So no guarantees? How should I use this?\\nA. Use it like the creators of the API have: as a way to understand baseline performance of a given influencer's channel and how you can back out of that with your own campaign's goals to a pricing number that makes sense.\\n\\nQ. Is there an offering for this API to integrate *directly* into my application?\\nA. Yes, feel free to reach out and we can discuss more custom integrations including callback url support\\n\\nQ.

This is currently planned and in development - if you have ideas for other platforms you'd like to be supported feel free to reach out!\\n\\nQ.  What is the accuracy of the estimations?\\nA. This estimator has been tested in dozens of real-life campaigns with clients spending 6-7 figures on each influencer native ad campaign, totaling out in a median margin of error of 10%. Not bad!\\n\\nWe will say that while most channels have a certain degree of predictability in terms of performance, more popular *and* less frequently posting channels are outliers that the estimator will only be so accurate in estimating.\\n\\nQ. So no guarantees? How should I use this?\\nA. Use it like the creators of the API have: as a way to understand baseline performance of a given influencer's channel and how you can back out of that with your own campaign's goals to a pricing number that makes sense.\\n\\nQ. Is there an offering for this API to integrate *directly* into my application?\\nA. Yes, feel free to reach out and we can discuss more custom integrations including callback url support\\n\\nQ.

Is there an offering for this API to integrate *directly* into my application?\\nA. Yes, feel free to reach out and we can discuss more custom integrations including callback url support\\n\\nQ.
